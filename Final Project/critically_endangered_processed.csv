It is confined to high elevation areas of the&#160;Mt Sinai massif in Egypt, with an extent of occurrence (EOO) no greater than 7 km¬≤ and an area of occupancy (AOO) less than 2 km¬≤. Its distribution is sufficiently small as to be considered a single, fragmented, location which could be threatened by a single drought event. Droughts have already had devastating implications for this species and its host plants over the past decade. The distribution of this butterfly is limited by that of its host plant, which has a highly fragmented distribution and which is subject to ongoing human exploitation.&#160;There is a continuing decline in habitat quality for this species; for example, between 2002 and 2010 the patch with the highest local population size of P. sinaicus lost 43.4% of its resource area, along with the death of 53% of the plant individuals and a reduction in average condition of the surviving plants (K. Thompson unpublished data). Climate change is projected to further reduce the EOO and AOO of this species, which is limited to high-elevation habitats. There are also extreme fluctuations in the number of mature individuals: population survey data for a single patch between 2002 to 2010 show that the species undergoes dramatic population cycles with severe crashes every three years. Such fluctuations could lead to stochastic local and global extinction (Gilbert et al. 2010).","The larvae feed exclusively on the flowers of Sinai Thyme (Thymus decussatus) Benth., 1834 (Labiatae), which is a near-endemic to the Ring Dyke and the nearby Asir Mountains of Saudi Arabia. The caterpillar has a facultative relationship with the ant Lepisiota which it appeases with sugar solution, and which in return protects the caterpillar from predatory ants such as Crematogaster. Adults are observed in a single generation during April‚ÄìJuly but are poor dispersers due to their small size (James 2006a,b).","Anthropogenic climate change&#160;is a current threat to this species: with the host plant already restricted to mountain tops, any increase in temperature is likely to lead to a reduction in available habitat for this butterfly (Hoyle and James 2005). Climate change around the Mediterranean basin is likely to result in a 2¬∫C temperature rise along with an additional month of drought each year, resulting in a reduction in available resources for the butterfly and larvae.&#160;The butterfly exists in a metapopulation and is threatened by increasing fragmentation/habitat isolation, whilst small population size also increases its extinction risk. Other threats include yearly environmental variation in this butterfly's host plant (Thymus decussatus), with a 40% reduction in the number of inflorescences noted between years. This would have a direct impact on the survival of the species (Hoyle and James 2005).&#160;Its host plant has been threatened by over-collection for medicinal purposes, and is currently listed as Endangered in the 1997 IUCN plants Red List (Walter and Gillett 1998).&#160;Hoyle and James (2005) also include overgrazing as a threat, but this is now not thought to be a significant threat; on the contrary, grazing might actually be required to maintain plant vigour.","The butterfly has been found to live on 25 of the 39 discrete patches of the host plant, existing in a classic metapopulation. Because of the small area and the prevailing threats, this makes up a single location. In 2001, the total global population size was estimated at approximately 2,300 adults.From surveys conducted over consecutive years in a single patch, the species has been inferred to undergo severe fluctuations. This is based on observed tenfold population increases between 2009‚Äì2010, and ninefold decreases observed in the 2002‚Äì2003 season. It is likely that fluctuations such as these are characteristic of the population as a whole, since they reflect environmental stochasticity acting at a range-wide scale rather than deterministic local habitat changes or demographic stochasticity within a patch.",Decreasing,"The Sinai Baton Blue is endemic to Egypt, occurring only at altitudes above 1,800 m within the Ring Dyke of St Katherine Protectorate, with its stronghold on Gebel Safsafa, the massif of Mt Sinai. The entire known extent of occurrence (EOO) is about 7 km¬≤; its area of occupancy (AOO) is less than 2 km¬≤.",,Terrestrial,"This butterfly‚Äôs distribution is entirely within the St Katherine Protectorate with the rangers continuing to monitor the species by carrying out 9‚Äì14 survey days each year (Gilbert et al. 2010). Recent conservation efforts are mainly focused on the endangered host plant. The thyme was previously threatened by over-collection due to its high medicinal value in Cairo. The Protectorate has recently banned collection with enforced fines for anyone caught. A fence has recently been erected around a patch found to contain a large butterfly population to prevent public access to stop further plant collection and to control grazing. Two dams were also built in this patch to hold more water in the soil to improve the condition of the thyme. The rangers have also tried to increase public awareness for this butterfly, considered as a flagship species for the Protectorate (El-Deen 2010).&#160;",Palearctic,,False,False,Global,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
1,North Africa,Carcharhinus longimanus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CARCHARHINIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,CARCHARHINIDAE,Carcharhinus,longimanus,A2bd,"The Oceanic Whitetip Shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) is a large (to 350 cm total length) wide-ranging, oceanic species of tropical and temperate seas worldwide with a preference for surface waters, though it has been reported to depths of 1,082 m. It has litters of 1‚Äì15 pups and likely has a biennial reproductive cycle. The species is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic large- and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries and is often retained for the meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The species has a high catchability due to its preference for surface waters and its inquisitive nature. Steep population declines have occurred in all oceans. The Oceanic Whitetip Shark was once one of the most abundant pelagic shark species in tropical seas worldwide but is now rare in some regions. The global population is estimated to have undergone a reduction of &gt;98%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (61.2 years). Therefore, the Oceanic Whitetip Shark is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Oceanic Whitetip is one of the most widespread sharks, ranging across entire oceans in tropical and subtropical waters (Young et al. 2017). It is an oceanic-epipelagic shark usually found far offshore in the open sea with a preference for surface waters, but it has been reported to depths of 1,082 m (Bonfil et al. 2008, Tolotti et al. 2015, Weigmann 2016).&#160;It reaches a maximum size of 350 cm total length (TL), possibly 395 cm TL; males mature at 168‚Äì198 cm TL and females at 175‚Äì224 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016, D'Alberto et al. 2017). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1‚Äì15 pups and litter size increases with female size; gestation period is 10‚Äì12 months with most likely a biennial reproductive cycle and size at birth of 57‚Äì77 cm TL (Seki&#160;et al. 1998,&#160;Bonfil et al. 2008, Last and Stevens 2009, Clarke et al. 2015). Consequently, the rate of population increase is very low and has been estimated at 0.039‚Äì0.067 (Smith et al. 2008), or 0.110 (Dulvy et al. 2008), although these may be overestimates as they are based on younger age-at-maturity and maximum age than has since been reported. There is regional variation in age estimates: female age-at-maturity is 4.5‚Äì8.8, 6.5, and 15.8 years, and maximum age is 11, 17, and 24.9 years in Northwest Pacific, Southwest Atlantic, and Western Central Pacific, respectively (Seki et al. 1998, Lessa et al. 1999, Liu and Tsai 2011, Joung et al. 2016, D'Alberto et al. 2017). Studies have verified annual periodicity of band formation but none have yet validated the age estimates. Using the precautionary approach, the older age-at-maturity of 15.8 years and maximum age of 24.9 years are used to calculate a generation length of 20.4 years across all regions."," The Oceanic Whitetip Shark is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of commercial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi et al. 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi et al. 2008, Martinez-Ortiz et al. 2015). The species is often retained for fins, and sometimes, the meat (Clarke et al. 2006a,Clarke&#160;et al.&#160;2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields et al. 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015). At vessel mortality of 34.2% was estimated on Portuguese longlines in the Atlantic (Coelho et al. 2012). The species has an inquisitive nature that increases its catchability (Ebert&#160;et al. 2013).","There are no data available on the global population size of the Oceanic Whitetip Shark. Genetic studies suggest there may be some genetic structure between the Western Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, however the data are preliminary and stock structures require further investigation (Camargo et al. 2016, Ruck et al. 2016, Young et al. 2017).Population trend data are available from six sources: (1) standardized catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) in the Northwest Atlantic (Young et al. 2017); (2) standardized CPUE in the Southwest Atlantic (Tolotti et al. 2013); (3) standardized CPUE in Hawaii (Brodziak and Walsh 2013); (4) stock assessment biomass in the Western Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) (Rice and Harley 2012); (5) updated standardized CPUE in the WCPO (Rice et al. 2015); and, (6) standardized CPUE from the Spanish longline fishery in the Indian Ocean (Ramos-Cartelle et al. 2012). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker et al. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).First, the observer CPUE time-series from the United States pelagic longline fishery for 1992‚Äì2015 indicated that the abundance in the Northwest Atlantic had declined from the 1990s to 2000s, after which it fluctuated but then remained relatively steady (Young et al. 2017). It was noted that fishing pressure had been present for decades prior to 1992 and that the species had likely experienced significant historical declines of 50 to 88% in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, respectively (Young et al. 2017). The trend analysis of the same time-series for 1992‚Äì2015 (24 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 4.3%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 93.1% over three generation lengths (61.2 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Although reported to have stabilized (Young et al. 2017), the annual rate of reduction in the time-series produced a high reduction when extrapolated beyond the length of the data time-series to three generation lengths.Second, robust catch data from the South Atlantic are lacking (Young et al. 2017). Observer CPUE data from the Brazil longline fishery from 2004‚Äì2010 showed a slight increase in abundance, however the data are from a short time-series and were susceptible to changes in fishing strategy during those years (Tolotti et al. 2013). The trend analysis of the same time-series for 2004‚Äì2010 (7 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 13.9%, consistent with an increasing abundance over three generation lengths (61.2 years). These CPUE data are from a large area around Brazil, but they may not be representative of the entire South Atlantic region. A more comprehensive analysis of catch rates of Oceanic Whitetip Shark on longlines in the South Atlantic revealed steep declines of 85% in the average CPUE from 1980‚Äì2011 (Barreto et al. 2016), however because the data were not considered robust due to the low catch rates and large confidence intervals (R. Barreto unpubl. data), they were not analysed over three generations.The third to the fifth data sources are all from the Pacific. Third, the observer standardized CPUE from the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery for 1995‚Äì2010 indicated a highly significant decline of 90% over the time-series (Brodziak and Walsh 2013). The trend analysis of the same data for 1995‚Äì2010 (16 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 16.3%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 100.0% over three generation lengths (61.2 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Fourth, the stock assessment based on observer longline data from the WCPO for 1995‚Äì2009 indicated an 86% decline in spawning stock biomass and that the stock of Oceanic Whitetip Shark is overfished with overfishing occurring (Rice and Harley 2012). The trend analysis of the same time-series for 1995‚Äì2009 (15 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 14.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 100.0% over three generation lengths (61.2 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Fifth, updated standardized CPUE data from the WCPO observer longline data from 1996‚Äì2014 indicate continuing declines with the stock likely maintaining an overfished status (Rice et al. 2015). The trend analysis of the same time series for 1996‚Äì2014 (19 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 5.3%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 98.6% over three generation lengths (61.2 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.Sixth, the standardized CPUE from the Spanish longline fishery in the Indian Ocean from 1998‚Äì2011 was highly variable, influenced by the low-prevalence of the species in some years, and not considered a plausible indicator of stock abundance (Ramos-Cartelle et al. 2012). The trend analysis of the same time series for 1998‚Äì2011(14 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 5.0%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 92.9% over three generation lengths (61.2 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Data from the Japanese longline fishery in the Indian Ocean was not analyzed due to unrealistic CPUE in the early years of the time-series, although in the latter years from 2003‚Äì2011, there is a generally decreasing trend (Yokawa and Semba 2012).Further to the above CPUE trend analyses, in the Eastern Pacific, nominal catches of Oceanic Whitetip Shark in purse seine fisheries have declined by 80‚Äì95% from the late 1990s to 2009 (Hall and Roman 2013, Young et al. 2017). In the Arabian Seas region, the species is inferred to have declined by &gt;80% over the last three generations (Jabado et al. 2017).This species was historically one of the most abundant shark species in tropical seas worldwide, and regional trends indicate it has experienced significant historical declines across its range, likely continues to experience global declines in abundance, and it is now rare in some regions (Young et al. 2017).Across the regions, the Oceanic Whitetip Shark was estimated to have severely declined in all oceans, including the South Atlantic. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region; the two sources of WCPO data were used to generate two global trends that both gave essentially the same result. The overall estimated median reduction was 98‚Äì100%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (61.2 years), and therefore the species is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.",Decreasing,"The Oceanic Whitetip Shark occurs worldwide in tropical and temperate waters (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013).","The species is used for its meat, fins, liver oil, and skin (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). The Oceanic Whitetip Shark accounted for 1.8% in 1991‚Äì2001 and 0.6% in 2014, of the fin imported in Hong Kong (Clarke et al. 2006a, Fields et al. 2018). In some regions, the meat of juvenile Oceanic Whitetip Shark is sold fresh for human consumption at local markets.",Marine,"The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking.  The Oceanic Whitetip Shark was the first (and is still currently the only) shark species to be subject to prohibitions on retention, transhipment, storage, and landing by all four major Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs) focused on tuna fisheries: the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (2010), the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (2011), the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (2012), and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (2013).  In 2013, the Oceanic Whitetip Shark was added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which requires exports from CITES Parties to be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries. In 2018, the Oceanic Whitetip Shark was added to Annex 1 of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for Migratory Sharks, even though the species is not (yet) included on the CMS Appendices. The MoU is aimed at facilitating regional conservation of listed shark and ray species.  To allow recovery, it is recommended that all Oceanic Whitetip Shark retention and landings be prohibited, in line with tuna RFMO obligations, at least as long as the global population is classified as Critically Endangered or Endangered. Initiatives to prevent capture, minimize bycatch mortality, promote safe release, and improve catch (including discard) reporting are also urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties.",,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
2,North Africa,Sphyrna lewini,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CARCHARHINIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,SPHYRNIDAE,Sphyrna,lewini,A2bd,"The Scalloped Hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) is a large (to 420 cm total length) coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark that is circumglobal in warm-temperate and tropical seas, from the surface and intertidal zone to depths of 1,043 m. The global population structure varies between males and females; males move across ocean basins, while females only move regionally. The species is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, and is retained for the meat and fins. The Scalloped Hammerhead has undergone steep declines in all oceans, with some signs of stabilization and possible recovery in response to management only in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. The weighted global population trend estimated median reductions of 76.9‚Äì97.3%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (72.3 years), and is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Scalloped Hammerhead is a coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark, found over continental and insular shelves and nearby deep water, ranging from the intertidal and surface usually to 275 m depth, though has been recorded to 1,043 m (Moore and Gates 2015). Adults spend most of the time offshore in midwater and females migrate to the coastal areas to pup (Clarke 1971, Bass et al. 1975, Klimley and Nelson 1984, Branstetter 1987, Klimley 1987, Chen et al. 1988, Stevens and Lyle 1989). It reaches a maximum size of 370‚Äì420 cm total length (TL) (Ebert et al. 2013). Males mature at 140‚Äì198 cm TL and females at 200‚Äì250 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Branstetter 1987, Chen et al. 1990, Carrera and Martinez 2007, White et al. 2008, Harry et al. 2011). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 12‚Äì41, an annual or biennial reproductive cycle, and a size at birth of 31‚Äì57 cm TL (Branstetter 1987, Chen et al. 1988, 1990; Stevens and Lyle 1989, Oliveira 1991, Amorim et al. 1994, Oliveira et al. 1997, White et al. 2008, Harry et al. 2011, Clarke et al. 2015, Gallagher and Klimley 2018). Annual band pair deposition for the Scalloped Hammerhead is assumed based on bomb radiocarbon validation of the Great Hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) (Passerotti et al. 2010); female age-at-maturity of the Scalloped Hammerhead is 13.2 years and maximum age is 35 years; generation length is therefore 24.1 years (Drew et al. 2015). Population growth rate estimates are 0.10‚Äì1.22 per year (Harry 2011, Cort√©s et al. 2012)."," The Scalloped Hammerhead is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi et al. 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi et al. 2008, Martinez-Ortiz et al. 2015, Temple et al. 2019). The species is also taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer&#160;et al.&#160;2010, Reid&#160;et al.&#160;2011). The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarke et al. 2006a, Clarke et al. 2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields et al. 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015). The species has high at-vessel mortality of 57.1% on Portuguese longlines in the Atlantic, 62.9% on United States shark bottom-longlines, and 71.4% for Western Australian demersal longlines (Coelho et al. 2012, Gulak&#160;et al.&#160;2015, Braccini and Waltrick 2019). The post-release mortality is higher for injured released sharks and has been reported as 100% for the Scalloped Hammerhead in purse seines (Eddy et al. 2016).&#160;"," There are no data available on the population size of the Scalloped Hammerhead. Genetic data reveal that the global population structure varies between males and females. Only males move across ocean basins, while females only move regionally and not between discontinuous continental coastlines (Duncan et al. 2006, Daly-Engel et al. 2012).Four sets of population trend data are available: (1) a stock assessment in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Jiao et al. 2011); and from standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in: (2) Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (J. Carlson and W.B. Driggers unpubl. data); (3) the South Pacific (Simpfendorfer et al. 2010); and, (4) the Indian Ocean (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). For the South Pacific, there is bather protection mesh and drumline CPUE (Noriega et al. 2011), yet these data spanned only one decade and were not considered in the global analysis. The above trend data were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker et al. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely Red List Category percent change over three generations (see Supplementary Material).First, the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico stock assessment indicated that the stock was overfished (B&lt;Bmsy) from the early 1980s with overfishing (F&gt;Fmsy) occurring periodically from 1983‚Äì2005 (Jiao et al. 2011). The steepest declines occurred prior to 1995, thereafter the abundance index remained stable until the end of the time series in 2005. The trend analysis of the modelled population abundance for 1981‚Äì2005 (25 years) yielded annual rates of reduction of 7.5% consistent with an estimated median reduction of 99.6% over three generation lengths (72.3 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.Second, more recent data (1994‚Äì2017) are available from the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico comprising two of the time-series underlying the Jiao et al. (2011) stock assessment (J. Carlson and W.B. Driggers unpubl. data). Both time-series indicate this population has begun to increase soon after the implementation of management. The annual fisheries-independent bottom longline surveys (Grace and Henwood 1998) were conducted throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico and Northwest Atlantic by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Mississippi Laboratories; called the NMFS Mississippi bottom longline shark survey (NMFS-LL-SE, in number of sharks per 10,000 hook hours; Ingram et al. 2005). These data (red in the Supplementary Information) exhibit a steep increase in CPUE from 2010 onwards. Additionally, the commercial shark bottom longline fishery is active in the U.S. Atlantic Ocean from around North Carolina to Florida and throughout the eastern Gulf of Mexico (BLLOP) (Morgan et al. 2009). These data (green in the Supplementary Information) exhibited a slight, but variable increasing trend. Both time-series taken together for 1994‚Äì2017 (24 years) demonstrated a median increase and the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths (72.3 years).Third, the analysis of the South Pacific Queensland Shark Control Program‚Äôs bather protection netting program population abundance for 1964‚Äì2004 (41 years) yielded annual rates of reduction of 8.4% consistent with an estimated median reduction of 99.8% over three generation lengths (72.3 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.Fourth, the analysis of the Indian Ocean Natal Sharks Board bather protection netting program population abundance for 1978‚Äì2003 (26 years) yielded annual rates of reduction of 4.0% consistent with an estimated median reduction of 93.4% over three generation lengths (72.3 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.In addition to these population trend analyses, we considered a recent analysis of fishery-dependent longline CPUE from the South Atlantic. These time-series are complex, reflecting access by different fleets and nationalities over time, but the best estimates of trends come from phase B spanning 1998 to 2008 during which 20 fleets (100 vessels) fished for tunas, swordfishes, and sharks. During this 10-year period there was a 61.7% decline in CPUE of hammerheads (Sphyrna spp.) (Table S11, Barreto et al. 2016), however, because the data were not considered robust due to the low catch rates and large confidence intervals (R. Barreto unpubl. data), they were not analysed over three generations.Across the regions, the Scalloped Hammerhead was estimated to have undergone steep declines in all oceans, with some signs of stabilization and possible recovery in response to management only in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region; the two sources of Atlantic data were used to generate two global trends. This resulted in a median reduction of 76.9‚Äì97.3%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (72.3 years), and therefore the Scalloped Hammerhead is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.",Decreasing,The Scalloped Hammerhead has a circumglobal distribution in coastal warm-temperate and tropical seas (Ebert et al 2013).," The main product from the species that is traded is the fins (CITES 2013). Hammerhead fins are among the main shark species in the fin trade and one of the preferred species for shark fin soup (Clarke et al. 2006a, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields et al. 2018). Three species of hammerhead shark, Scalloped Hammerhead, Great Hammerhead, and Smooth Hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), collectively accounted for 4% of the fin imported in Hong Kong in 2014 (Fields et al. 2018). The meat, liver oil, skin, cartilage and jaws may also be used (Almer√≥n-Souza et al. 2018). ",Marine," The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking.  In 2010, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) prohibited retention, transshipment, landing, and sale of Scalloped Hammerheads (and other hammerhead species) for ICCAT fisheries operating in the Convention Area. There are exceptions for local consumption in developing countries, provided they cap catches, meet catch data reporting requirements, and ensure fins are not traded internationally. The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) designated the Scalloped Hammerhead as a 'key shark species' in 2010, but has yet to adopt hammerhead catch limits. Several proposals to ban hammerhead landings and/or set regional hammerhead fishing limits through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) have been defeated. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) has yet to act on 2018 scientific advice to adopt Scalloped Hammerhead fishery management measures.  In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Scalloped Hammerhead and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow.

3,North Africa,Sphyrna mokarran,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CARCHARHINIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,SPHYRNIDAE,Sphyrna,mokarran,A2bd,"The Great Hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) is a large (to 610 cm total length) coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark, wide-ranging in tropical and warm temperate seas to depths of 300 m. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in coastal and pelagic large- and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, and is often retained for the fins. It has a long lifespan of up to 44 years and only breeds once every two years, which combined with high bycatch mortality, makes it susceptible to depletion where it is taken in unmanaged fisheries. The Great Hammerhead appears to have undergone steep declines in the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and in the Atlantic prior to management measures, where slow recovery may now be occurring in the Northwest Atlantic. The global population is estimated to have undergone reductions of 50.9‚Äì62.4%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (71.1‚Äì74.4 years). There is a lack of data from the Pacific, limited regional representation of some time-series, intensive fisheries in data-poor regions that are suspected to have driven significant declines, and uncertainty about levels of exploitation that are potentially similar to those of the Scalloped Hammerhead (S. lewini) (which has been assessed as globally Critically Endangered). Expert judgement elicitation thus used a precautionary approach and concurred with the highest probability of reduction of &gt;80% over three generation lengths (71.1‚Äì74.4 years). The Great Hammerhead is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Great Hammerhead is a generally solitary, coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark, that occurs close inshore and well offshore at depths ranging from near-surface to 300 m deep (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). The maximum size is reported as 550 to 610 cm total length (TL) reported by Compagno (1984), though 400 cm TL is a more commonly observed maximum size (Stevens and Lyle 1989, Last and Stevens 2009, Piercy et al. 2010, Harry et al. 2011). Males mature at 225‚Äì269 cm TL and females mature at 210‚Äì300 cm TL (Stevens and Lyle 1989, Harry et al. 2011, Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with litter size of 6‚Äì42 pups, a gestation time of 11 months, a likely biennial reproductive cycle, and a size-at-birth of 50‚Äì70 cm TL (Stevens and Lyle 1989, Harry et al. 2011, Ebert et al. 2013, Clarke et al. 2015). There is regional variation in age estimates; female age-at-maturity is 5.5 and 8.3 years and maximum age is 44 and 39 years; generation length is therefore 24.8 and 23.7 years in Northwest Atlantic and Western Central Pacific, respectively (Passerotti et al. 2010, Piercy et al. 2010, Harry et al. 2011). Population growth rate estimate is 0.07 per year (Cort√©s et al. 2012)."," The Great Hammerhead is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (White et al. 2006, Camhi et al. 2008, Lack and Meere 2009, Diop and Dossa 2011, Miller et al. 2014). The species is often retained for the fins (Clarke et al. 2006a, Clarke et al. 2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields et al. 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015). At-vessel mortality is estimated as 56% on U.S. shark bottom-longlines and 30.8% on Western Australia demersal longlines (Gulak et al. 2015, Braccini and Waltrick 2019). The post-release mortality is higher for injured released sharks and has been reported as 100% for the closely-related Scalloped Hammerhead in purse seines (Eddy et al. 2016). The species is taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011).","There are no data available on the global population size of the Great Hammerhead. Genetic studies support two subpopulations of Great Hammerhead, the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific (Testerman 2014). No genetic structure was found within the Atlantic or within the Indo-Pacific between eastern and western Australia (Testerman 2014).Population trend data are available from three sources: (1) stock assessment in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Jiao et al. 2011), and from standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in: (2) Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (J. Carlson unpubl. data) and, (3) the Indian Ocean (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker et al. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).First, the Northwest Atlantic stock assessment indicated that the stock was overfished from the mid-1980s with overfishing occurring periodically from 1983‚Äì1997 and the risk of overfishing low after 2001 (Jiao et al. 2011). A previous stock assessment also found the stock overfished but experiencing overfishing after 2001 (Hayes 2008); however, both stock assessments report a high degree of uncertainty mostly due to poor catch data (Miller et al. 2014). The trend analysis of the Northwest Atlantic modeled abundance for 1981‚Äì2005 (25 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.4%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 29.1% over three generation lengths (74.4 years), with the highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths. Second, more recent data (1994‚Äì2017) are available from the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico comprising two of the time-series underlying the Jiao et al. (2011) stock assessment (J. Carlson unpubl. data). Both time-series indicate this population has begun to increase soon after the implementation of management after 2005 (NMFS 2006). The annual fisheries-independent bottom longline surveys (Grace and Henwood 1998) were conducted throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Atlantic by the National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Mississippi Laboratories; called the NMFS Mississippi bottom longline shark survey (NMFS-LL-SE; Ingram et al. 2005). These data (red in the Supplementary Information) exhibit an increase in CPUE from 2005 onwards. Additionally, the commercial shark bottom longline fishery is active in the U.S. Atlantic Ocean from around North Carolina to Florida and throughout the eastern Gulf of Mexico (BLLOP) (Morgan et al. 2009). These data (green in the Supplementary Information) exhibited an increasing but variable trend. Both time-series taken together for 1994‚Äì2017 (24 years) demonstrated a median increase and the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths (74.4 years). Third, the analysis of population abundance from the Indian Ocean Natal Shark‚Äôs Board bather protection netting program for 1978‚Äì2003 (26 years) (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006) yielded annual rates of reduction of 6.5% consistent with a median reduction of 99.3% over three generation lengths (71.1 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengthsIn addition to these population trend analyses, we considered a recent analysis of fishery-dependent longline CPUE from the South Atlantic. These time-series are complex, reflecting access by different fleets and nationalities over time, but the best estimates of trends come from phase B spanning 1998 to 2008 during which 20 fleets (170 vessels) fished for tunas, swordfishes, and sharks. During this 10-year period there was a 61.7% decline in CPUE of hammerheads (Sphyrna spp.) (Table S11, Barreto et al. 2016), however, because the data were not considered robust due to the low catch rates and large confidence intervals (R. Barreto unpubl. data), they were not analyzed over three generations. Steep declines of hammerheads (Sphyrna spp.) have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea; Ferretti et al. (2008) compiled nine time-series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys and sighting records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in the northwest Mediterranean Sea. Of the taxa for which there were enough data to investigate, hammerhead sharks declined the fastest; disappearing from coastal waters after 1963 followed by declines (across all fishing sectors) in pelagic waters by the early 1980s. Meta-analysis showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in abundance of -0.17 (time range 178 years) and biomass of -0.36 (time range 107 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 99.99% in abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferretti et al. 2008). Walker et al. (2005) also report that hammerhead species have virtually disappeared from the central-southern Mediterranean Sea since 1986. Population trend data are lacking from the North Pacific and are limited from the Western Central Pacific, where hammerhead catches are for the species-complex, with no indication of the proportion of Great Hammerheads. The CPUE (1995‚Äì2015) was highly variable and as Great Hammerhead are captured infrequently, little inference was possible from the temporal trend (Rice et al. 2015). Fishing pressure has significantly increased in recent decades across the distribution range of the Great Hammerhead in the tropical Indian Ocean and West Africa (Cooke 1997, Bruckner et al. 2011, Belhabib et al. 2012, ANSD 2016, Jabado et al. 2017), and has likely caused declines in these regions.The Great Hammerhead was estimated to have undergone steep declines in the Indian Ocean with the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico showing historic declines but some signs of stabilization and possible recovery in response to management. The Atlantic subpopulation is inferred to have undergone a &gt;50% reduction over three generation lengths (74.4 years); although there is possible recovery in the Northwest Atlantic, there is also a high degree of uncertainty in the data and high levels of exploitation. The Indo-Pacific subpopulation is inferred to have undergone a &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (71.1 years). To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for the North Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions were weighted according to the relative size of each region; the two sources of Atlantic data were used to generate two global trends. This resulted in a median reduction of 50.9‚Äì62.4%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction in both trends over three generation lengths (71.1‚Äì74.4 years). However, the area of some time-series is limited relative to the region and may not accurately represent the trend in Great Hammerhead across the entire region. There is uncertainty in some of the catch data and levels of exploitation. Exploitation levels may be similar to those of those of the Scalloped Hammerhead, though this is not definitively known, and the regions with no trend data are likely areas where the species is under intensive fishing pressure, such as the tropical Indian Ocean and West Africa. Hence, a precautionary approach was taken and expert judgement elicitation inferred a global population reduction of &gt;80% over three generation lengths (71.1‚Äì74.4 years). Therefore, the Great Hammerhead is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.",Decreasing,"The Great Hammerhead ranges worldwide throughout tropical and warm temperate seas (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013).","The main product from the species that is traded is the fins (CITES 2013). Hammerhead fins are a significant component of the fin trade and one of the preferred species for shark fin soup (Clarke et al. 2006a, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields et al. 2018). Three species of hammerhead shark, Great Hammerhead, Scalloped Hammerhead, and Smooth Hammerhead (S. zygaena), collectively accounted for 4% of the fin imported in Hong Kong in 2014 (Fields et al. 2018). The meat, liver oil, skin, cartilage, and jaws may also be used (White et al. 2006, Lack and Meere 2009, Miller et al. 2014, Glaus et al. 2015).",Marine," The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking.  In 2010, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) prohibited retention, transshipment, landing, and sale of Great Hammerheads (and other hammerhead species) for ICCAT fisheries operating in the Convention Area. There are exceptions for local consumption in developing countries, provided they cap catches, meet catch data reporting requirements, and ensure fins are not traded internationally. The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) designated the Great Hammerhead as a 'key shark species' in 2010, but has yet to adopt hammerhead catch limits. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Great Hammerhead and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow. Several proposals to ban hammerhead landings and/or set regional hammerhead fishing limits through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) have been defeated. In 2013, the Great Hammerhead was added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) based on its similarity to the Scalloped Hammerhead. The listing requires CITES Parties to ensure that exports be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries. In 2014, the Great Hammerhead was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which reflects Parties‚Äô commitments to work regionally toward conservation.

21,North Africa,Testudo kleinmanni,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,TESTUDINES,REPTILIA,TESTUDINIDAE,Testudo,kleinmanni,A2abcd+3d,"This species was previously assessed as Endangered. However, northeastern populations that were previously assigned to T. kleinmanni recently have been accepted as a separate species (Per√§l√§ 2001). The species' extent of occurrence covered an estimated area of 123,610 km¬≤ less than three generations ago. Today it is estimated at around 16,600 km¬≤. Within the same period population sizes are estimated to have reduced by over 85% from around 55,600 to 7,470 individuals, of which approximately 5,000 are mature individuals. This figure is less than the number of animals recorded from the illegal pet trade in the 1990s alone. Fairly good habitat patches still exist in Libya but the global population of T. kleinmanni could realistically face extinction in less than 20 years or around one generation if degradation of landscape and trade cannot be stopped.","T. kleinmanni populations in northern Egypt are historically associated with desert and semi-desert habitats characterized or dominated by compact sand and gravel plains with scattered rocks and shallow sandy wadis, although populations were also known to occur in or adjacent to coastal salt marsh habitats (Lortet 1887, Baha El Din 1994). The majority of the species' primary habitats in Egypt are currently severely degraded, or already completely destroyed (Baha El Din 1994).
 
 In Cyrenaica, northeastern Libya, the species occurs in shrubby sand and stone desert habitats (coast) and semidesert habitats with Artemisia association (further inland), according to Schleich (1987, 1989). Schleich et al. (1996) consider the species to occupy generally the margins of sandy, or dry stony, habitats. T. kleinmanni can apparently also be found (together with Testudo graeca species complex tortoises) in more vegetated Mediterranean subtropical shrub evergreen forests, as can be inferred from Schleich (1989) who cites Suluntah as a locality. It is however not clear how typical this habitat association is for T. kleinmanni in northeastern Libya, thus it is probably most appropriate to describe the species' primary habitat preference in Cyrenaica as Mediterranean scrub. Habitats are still in fairly good condition in Libya, but there are signs of extensive overgrazing in many parts, particularly in Cyrenaica, and ploughing for growing cereals is a common practice, and trends and plans for habitat utilization are unclear (S. Baha El Din 2002). According to fieldwork by A. Pieh (pers. comm.), in Cyrenaica habitat is locally still very good near Suluntah, and reasonably well preserved in the wadi system near Darnah. However, habitat on the whole coastal stretch between Darnah and Tubruq is severely degraded possibly due to extensive, and continuing, nomadic activity in that area. In Tripolitania habitat degradation due to human expansion is very evident on the coast east of Al Khums around Leptis Magna, whereas habitat in more southerly areas towards the inland near Gharyan ""looks better"" (A. Pieh, pers. comm.). Further, according to Pieh (pers. comm.), the coastline between Al Khums and the Tunisian border features occasional spots of undisturbed habitat.","In addition to agricultural (including overgrazing), developmental and industrial pressures, T. kleinmanni was very heavily affected by the (eventually illegal) national and international pet trade that began using the Libyan stock after Egyptian subpopulations were harvested to extinction (Baha El Din 1994). The brochure of Tortoise Care (The Egyptian Tortoise Conservation Program) (Anonymous 2000) as well as S. Baha El Din (2002) list the illegal trade in T. kleinmanni of Libyan origin within Egypt as continuing. Trade in T. kleinmanni also exists within Libya itself (Fritz and Buskirk 1997; Pieh. pers. comm.; S. Baha El Din 2002), with potentially devastating consequences for the remaining world population. According to locals, collection pressure is higher in the east than in the west. Tortoises have a low annual biomass production resulting in a high degree of sensitivity to population disturbance and consequent poor recovery abilities from such activities as trade collection (Iverson 1982).","Currently, the species is effectively extinct within Egypt. Baha El Din (1994) surveyed the whole former range of T. kleinmanni in Egypt and concluded that the species disappeared completely within a period of approximately 10 to 20 years (between the early 1970s and the early 1990s). This time frame is estimated to represent around, or slightly more than, one generation length for T. kleinmanni, taking into consideration that maturity is probably reached at about 10-20 years in the wild as is the case in several other species of testudinids living in semiarid or arid conditions (e.g., Woodbury and Hardy 1948, Brushko 1977, review in: Kuzmin 2002). In 2001, two wild tortoises were found in a protected coastal area in the Western Desert, the first record for T. kleinmanni in Egypt in over twenty years (M. Baha El Din 2002). This finding, although significant per se, does naturally nothing to change the fact that T. kleinmanni is effectively extinct in Egypt.
 
 The species can still be found in two distinct, and geographically disjunct regions in Libya (Tripolitania and Cyrenaica).
 
 Judging by data produced in Iverson (1992), Buskirk (1985) and Baha El Din (1994), the species' extent of occurrence in Egypt, possibly up to the early 1970s, is estimated as having been around 67,860 km¬≤. According to available data (Buskirk 1985, Iverson 1986, 1992, Fritz and Buskirk 1997, Per√§l√§ 2001, Pieh, pers. comm.), the small northwestern (Tripolitanian) range encompasses an estimated extent of occurrence of around 5,500 km¬≤. Nothing is known about local population densities but A. Pieh (pers. comm.) concluded in situ that the coastal subpopulation has to be severely fragmented because of a mosaic of badly degraded habitat. The estimated extent of occurrence for present Cyrenaican population of T. kleinmanni is around 11,100 km¬≤, as measured using a minimum convex polygon and locality data provided by S. Baha El Din (2002), and Pieh (pers. comm.). Some 40 years ago the Cyrenaican T. kleinmanni population had possibly an estimated extent of occurrence of 50,250 km¬≤ as calculated using data from Buskirk (1985), Iverson (1992), and Per√§l√§ (2001), as well as assuming that the distribution was continuous from Cyrenaica to western Egypt. The isolated locality of ""Sirtica"" (Loveridge and Williams 1957) some 300 km west of Qaminis (Gheminez) in western Cyrenaica was not taken into account.
 
 Because no fieldwork based data on the area of occupancy exist for T. kleinmanni, the area of occupancy is defined as 10% of the area of extent of occurrence, yielding estimations of total past area of occupancy 12,361 km¬≤ and total present area of occupancy 1,660 km¬≤.
 
 20 years ago, Mendelssohn (1982) estimated the global population size of T. kleinmanni (including T. werneri from Sinai and Israel) at less than 10,000 individuals, including immature tortoises. This figure seems to be an underestimation regarding current estimates and statistics on trade. Mendelssohn (1982) also was not aware of the existence of T. kleinmanni in northwestern Libya, which was therefore not taken into account in his assessment. Although no population density assessments based on local field data have been published for T. kleinmanni in mainland Egypt and Libya, densities are thought to be very low (Buskirk 1985, Schleich 1989, Baha El Din 1994, M. Baha El Din 2002, S. Baha El Din 2002, A. Pieh, pers. comm.). Locals in Libya stated in April 2002 that populations of the species still exist in many parts of Cyrenaica, but that they have declined notably in recent years due to collection (S. Baha El Din 2002). Per√§l√§ (2002) estimates the past total world population at 55,624 individuals, substantially more than the estimate by Mendelssohn (1982). The total present world population of T. kleinmanni is estimated at 7,470 individuals (Per√§l√§ 2002), which is considerably less than the number of recorded animals collected in Libya for the pet trade in the 1990s. Out of the existing global population around 75% (5,000 individuals) would be mature adults if Mendelssohn's (1982) data on population structure for T. werneri is applicable for T. kleinmanni. According to the above estimate, the global population of T. kleinmanni would have declined by 86.6% (or by 48,152 individuals) in less than three generations. Out of these, at least 10,680 individuals have been recorded from the illegal pet trade in the 1990s alone (Baha El Din 1994, Ventura 1995, Pieh, pers. comm.). Because relatively good habitat still exists in Libya it is possible that the earlier inferred reduction in the extent of occurrence primarily reflects pressure from collection and illegal trade, rather than habitat degradation (in Libya).",Decreasing,"Populations east of the Nile delta in Egypt and in Israel formerly assigned to T. kleinmanni have been shown to encompass a separate species Testudo werneri (Per√§l√§ 2001). Consequently, this assessment does not take into account information based on the above geographical region traditionally incorporated into papers on T. kleinmanni (Per 2002).  Historically, the range of T. kleinmanni runs along the Mediterranean coastal strip up to about 90-120 km, exceptionally further, towards inland in Libya (where disjunct populations exist in Tripolitania and in the Cyrenaican Peninsula) and more or less continuously from northeastern Libya to the Western Desert and the north coast in mainland Egypt (Lortet 1883, 1887, Loveridge and Williams 1957, Buskirk 1985, Iverson 1986, 1992, Baha El Din 1994, Fritz and Buskirk 1997, Per√§l√§ 2001). The range has possibly been much greater in the past, and localities further inland or in the west, such as Siwa Oasis and the Tripolitanian range respectively, may represent the last remnants of a more extensive distribution in historical times which could have decreased with the natural aridification and expansion of the Saharan desert. Thus a priori treatments of isolated occurrences of T. kleinmanni as human introductions, or as extralimital, should be viewed with caution.",,Terrestrial,"Whereas T. kleinmanni is covered by international conservation policies (the species is included in CITES Appendix I), and although it is protected by Egyptian law (Baha El Din 1994; Anonymous 2000), the species is unprotected in Libya (Anonymous 2000; S. Baha El Din 2002). However, recent information (M. Baha El Din 2002; S. Baha El Din 2002) suggests that the Libyan Environment General Authority and local academics show interest for tortoise conservation in Libya, and that they are looking forward to cooperating with the Egyptian based TortoiseCare program. Despite protection of T. kleinmanni by law in Egypt, the law is not implemented at all times (Baha El Din 1994; Anonymous 2000). S. Baha El Din (2002) indicates that TortoiseCare will continue to seek funding for future activities for the conservation of T. kleinmanni, and particularly for the development of a species action plan that takes into consideration the conservation needs of the species on a global level, including both Egypt and Libya.  Populations from Sinai and Israel, attributed traditionally to T. kleinmanni, were shown to comprise a separate species (Per√§l√§ 2001). However, the limited data available suggest that the geographically isolated subpopulation of T. kleinmanni from Tripolitania might additionally be taxonomically distinct. It is essential that local subpopulations are not mixed in any circumstances, including possible breeding projects, whether in or ex situ. The use of captive or confiscated stock of unknown origins or parentage in conservation programs should be discouraged at all times for the same reasons.  Data for uses and harvest levels are largely known for Egypt only (Baha El Din 1994) where monitoring is continuing (Anonymous 2000). No data are available for Libya.  Conservation measures are going on in Egypt (M. Baha El Din 2002) but not yet in Libya. More research is needed also in Egypt, such as a systematic search and identification of habitat pockets where tortoises might still exist.  Protected areas exist in Egypt, including the one in which two individuals were recently found, and more are needed according to Baha El Din (1994), Anonymous (2000) and M. Baha El Din (2002). The motives for establishing new protected areas especially for T. kleinmanni are not entirely clear as the species is already effectively extinct in Egypt. Reintroduction projects have been currently stalled in Egypt (M. Baha El Din 2002). T. kleinmanni may occur in Kouf National Park in NE Libya (Schleich 1987) where one specimen was found 20 years ago (FMNH collection data). Other Libyan reserves in areas of tortoise activity are nonexistent (S. Baha El Din 2002). Protected areas would greatly enhance the survival prospects of the entire species if trade can be stopped.",Palearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
22,North Africa,Dipturus batis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,RAJIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,RAJIDAE,Dipturus,batis,A2bcd+4bcd,"This skate, the largest European rajid, was once an abundant constituent of the demersal fish community of north-western Europe. It formerly occupied the shelf and slope areas of the Mediterranean excluding North Africa west of Morocco but now appears to be virtually absent from much of this range. Caught as bycatch of multispecies trawl fisheries, which cover much of its shelf and slope habitat. Fisheries data indicate that populations of D. batis have undergone an extremely high level of depletion in the central part of its range around the British Isles since the early 20th century (the three generation period). It has been extirpated from most inshore areas, but is still caught in Scottish waters, especially around the Shetlands and off North-west Scotland, and also along the shelf edge and in the Celtic Sea. Fishing capacity and effort in the Mediterranean have also increased substantially over the later half of the 20th century. Accurate international species-specific landings data are lacking, although Icelandic landings have declined. French landings appear stable, though this is likely to be attributed to a re-direction of fishing effort from shelf seas (where common skate are now very rare) into deeper water. The life history and demography of this species allow little capacity to withstand exploitation by fisheries, its large body size renders it catchable by fishing gears even from birth. As fishing pressure on this species is unlikely to be reduced in the future, it is assessed as Critically Endangered throughout its range.","This demersal species is found from shallow coastal waters down to depths of 600 m, although it is primarily within the 200 m depth range (Stehmann and Burkel 1984, Bouchot 1987, Serena 2005). This is the largest species of skate attaining a length of more than 250 cm. The age and growth of D. batis has been reported by Du Buit (1972 1976) and more recently by Fahy (1991) who examined the vertebrae of 75 individuals landed in Ireland. Du Buit (1976) gave the following growth parameters: Maximum length 253.73 cm; k = 0.057; t0 = -1.629. Males are thought to mature at a length of 125 cm (Du Buit 1972) and although the size at maturity has not been accurately determined for females, an estimate of 150 cm was presented in the 2000 Red List assessment (Ellis et al. 2000). Du Buit (1976) determined that maturity is reached at 11 years of age and that individuals may live for 50 years. The overall sex ratio has been reported to be approximately 1:1, although this may differ geographically and seasonally (Fulton 1903, Steven 1933). The fecundity has not been accurately determined but was estimated at 40 eggs/year over the spawning season (Brander 1981) and the rate of reproduction has been calculated at 0.38. Oviparous, with large egg-cases covered with close-felted fibres (150 to 250 mm long and 80 to 150 mm wide reported in the Mediterranean (Serena 2005) and 145 to 245 mm long in the UK (Clark 1922, Wheeler 1969). The egg-cases are deposited in spring and summer in both the Mediterranean and Northeast Atlantic (Clark 1922, Wheeler 1969, Serena 2005). The young hatch at a lengths of up to 21.2 to 22.3 cm (Clark 1926). There is no detailed information on the developmental time.  Dipturus batis preys mostly on crustaceans and teleost fish, although Steven (1947) reported several species of elasmobranch, including other species of rajid, in the stomach contents of fish landed in Devon and Cornwall. The skate hunts actively and envelops its prey prior to capture and ingestion. The dark ventral surface may facilitate hunting in the pelagic phase.  While there is almost no life history and ecological information specific to the Mediterranean it is likely that it is similar to that exhibited in more northerly waters.","Northeast Atlantic: Rajids are an important component of the demersal fisheries of northwest Europe (Holden 1977) and Dipturus batis has traditionally been landed due to its large size (see Ellis et al. 2000 for details). It has taken in targeted fisheries where/when abundant, and as a bycatch elsewhere within its range. Accurate species-specific landings data are not available, though species-specific data from Iceland indicate declining landings of this species. Though French data appear more stable, these landings include landings from fisheries operating towards the edge of the continental shelf, where the population now appears to be concentrated. Given that this species is likely to be taken in trawl and gillnet fisheries that target high-value telesosts (e.g., megrim, anglerfish and hake), it is unlikely that fishing effort will decrease. Common skate are targeted by recreational fisheries (e.g., off Scotland), most anglers release captured individuals.  Mediterranean The situation appears similar in the Mediterranean, where D. batis is probably captured as part of the bycatch of multispecies trawl fisheries. Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and in technological terms in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean over the last 50 years. For example, the Gulf of Lions area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries comprising 27 small low powered boats (total nominal horse power of 2,700 hp), more recently effort has increased to a total nominal horse power of 19,940 hp (1974 to 1987). Since then half of the fishing effort has been displaced to targeting small pelagic fish (Aldebert 1997). The Adriatic Sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croation, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, however, no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic et al. 2001). The large body size, slow growth, low fecundity and large size of juveniles of this species makes it especially vulnerable to fishing exploitation when compared to other rajids (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy et al. 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Moreover, although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes are taken in fishing nets, including the eggs (which are often found in the trawl cod-end, Ragonese et al. 2003), as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean is approximately 20 mm. Considering the large size at maturity (around 130 cm) this means that the exploitation of juveniles is likely to be high. Additionally D. batis has been found to have undergone declines and disappearance from other shelf seas, notably the Irish and North Sea (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy et al. 2000).","North-east Atlantic: Common skate, as the name implies, was historically one of the most abundant skates and rays in the North-east Atlantic. It was widely distributed in the seas surrounding the British Isles, though catch rates of this species in this area declined during the 20th century. By the 1970s common skate was considered extirpated from the Irish Sea (Brander 1981), and they have also disappeared from the English Channel and the southern and central North Sea (Walker 1999, Rogers and Ellis 2000). Though individual specimens are reported occasionally from these areas (e.g., Ellis et al. 2002, Ellis et al. 2005), common skate are now only regularly observed off northern and north-western Scotland, Celtic Sea and along the edge of the continental shelf (&gt;150 m depth).  A time series of comparative trawl surveys in the Gulf of Lions between 1957-1960 indicate that D. batis was historically present in both shelf and slope trawl surveys. It was captured in 10% of hauls (n=27) in shelf surveys (coast-150 m depth) and in approximately 17% of hauls (n=37) in slope surveys (150-800 m) (Aldebert 1997). In contrast, comparable surveys carried out from 1966-1995 in the Gulf of Lions (totalling 1,295 hauls) did not record this species (Aldebert 1997). In the Adriatic Sea, the ""Hvar"" 1948 trawl surveys (based on 138 valid hauls taken in the spring-summer of 1948) revealed D. batis present in 3.2% of hauls. In a comparable survey conducted in the spring-summer of 1998 (127 valid hauls) (MEDITS) it was not recaptured, suggesting D. batis may now be absent from this area (Jukic-Peladic 2001). The MEDITS survey began in 1994 while another study of the Adriatic Sea had begun in 1985 (GRUND), with each project carrying out one survey per year. A single individual was captured in the first GRUND survey of 1985 and since then no specimens have appeared in the Adriatic in either of these surveys (Marano et al. in press). It is now regarded as locally extinct in the Adriatic Sea (Tinti et al. 2003). Although these surveys are exhaustive, it should be noted that the MEDITS net is thought to have a low sampling efficiency of truly benthic species (Jukic-Peladic 2001). Along the Algerian coast from 1996-1997, regular systematic surveys of elasmobranchs present in markets have been undertaken. Although eight species of skate have been recorded, D. batis has not been reported (Hemida 1998). Tunisian fisheries use prawn trawl and larger ""French"" trawls, which frequently capture skates and demersal sharks. While this species has been documented from Tunisian waters in the early part of the 20th century, it has not been recorded since 1971 and it is now presumed absent from this area (Brada√Ø 2000).  The former range of this skate included much of the west, north and eastern shelf and slope habitat of the Mediterranean. These results suggest that this species may only be found in the western area of the Mediterranean (Morocco, Spain and France) representing a substantial reduction in area of occurrence of this species.",Decreasing,"The historical geographical range of D. batis covered much of the continental shelf of the North-east Atlantic, from Madeira and the coast of northern Morocco in the south, to Iceland and northern Norway in the north, including the Mediterranean Sea. In several parts of its range, including the Western Baltic, western Mediterranean and southern North Sea, it is considered scarce (Stehmann and B√ºrkel 1984). It is absent from the Black Sea and Levantine Mediterranean basin (Serena 2005). At the start of the twentieth century it was considered to have a wide distribution over the shallower waters of the continental shelf surrounding the British Isles, albeit more common in the northern and western regions (Walker and Heesen 1996). Though individual specimens are reported very occasionally from the Irish Sea, Bristol Channel and central North Sea, the current range tends to occupy the deeper waters off northwestern Scotland and in Celtic Sea, and along the edge of the continental shelf.",,Marine,"It is recommended that suitable non-trawling areas are defined to protect both adults and deposited eggs as these are both susceptible to capture by trawling gear.  Northeast Atlantic: Though there are no species-specific management measures for this species, there is a TAC for skates and rays in the North Sea and adjacent waters, and they may benefit from more generic management measures for demersal fisheries (e.g. mesh size regulations, effort reduction). Diptutus batis has been identified by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Study Group on Elasmobranch Fish as one which ""requires information on either fisheries statistics, biology or status of exploitation"" or in the case of D. batis, all three (Anonymous 1995). Demographic information indicates that population recovery might be achieved by allowing increasing juvenile survival (Walker and Hislop 1998). Dipturus batis was proposed for strict protection under the UK Wildlife and Countryside Act in 2001; a decision is still (2006) awaited from government. D. batis is also a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species in the UK, and was listed on the OSPAR Priority List of Threatened and Endangered Species.  Mediterranean: For the conservation of chondrichthyans within the Mediterranean region, the FAO SAC Subcommittee on the Environment and Ecosystem recommended that all fishing states implement a Mediterranean Action Plan for the Management and Conservation of chondrichthyans, in line with IPOA sharks (International Plan of Action on the management and conservation of chondrichthyans).  The MEDLEM project was adopted at the last SAC meeting (FAO, Rome 2005) for data collection within the Mediterranean basin on large elasmobranches. The Bern Convention encourages research programs aimed at the assessment of the conservation status of chondrichthyans in the Mediterranean Sea (Serena et al. 2002). In Italy a national action plan (PAN-SHARKS) was co-ordinated by ICCRAM (Central Institute for Marine Research) within the guidelines of the Bern Convention and FAO IPOA-Sharks (Serena et al. 2002, Vacchi and Notarbartolo 2000). The Barcelona Convention proposed this species for urgent legal protection under its Mediterranean Action Plan.A new European requirement is that common skates, when caught, should be returned to the sea - applies only to the North Sea.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

26,North Africa,Eretmochelys imbricata,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,TESTUDINES,REPTILIA,CHELONIIDAE,Eretmochelys,imbricata,A2bd,"RationaleAnalysis of historic and recent published and unpublished accounts indicate extensive subpopulation declines in all major ocean basins over the last three Hawksbill generations as a result of over-exploitation of adult females and eggs at nesting beaches, degradation of nesting habitats, take of juveniles and adults in foraging areas, incidental mortality relating to marine fisheries, and degradation of marine habitats. Analyses of subpopulation changes at 25 Index Sites distributed globally (see W-Figure 1 in Supplementary Material) show an 84 to 87% decline in number of mature females nesting annually over the last 3 Hawksbill generations (see W-Table 1 in Supplementary Material). Numerous populations, especially some of the larger ones, have continued to decline since the last assessment of the species (Meylan and Donnelly 1999). Today, some protected populations are stable or increasing, but the overall decline of the species, when considered within the context of three generations, has been in excess of 80%.Assessment Procedure:In accord with the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, the Hawksbill is listed as Critically Endangered (CR A2bd) because it meets the following criteria:A.&#160; Reduction in population size based on:2.&#160;&#160;&#160; An observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population size reduction of 80% over the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer, where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible, based on (and specifying):(b)&#160;&#160;&#160; an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon; and(d)&#160;&#160; actual or potential levels of exploitation.This assessment measures changes in populations based on the number of mature individuals (IUCN 2001a), specifically changes in the annual number of nesting females.Index Sites:Choice of Index Sites.&#160; Reliable historic data are not available for all subpopulations, so the present report quantifies population trends by examining data from 25 Index Sites (see W-Figure 1, IND-Table 1, PAC-Table 1 and ATL-Table 1 in Supplementary Material). Index Sites were chosen to represent broad regional subpopulation trends over time and include representative major nesting areas as well as many of the lesser nesting areas for which quantitative data are available. An estimated 41% of the current global population of nesting females is represented by index sites.The most reliable method of monitoring trends in sea turtle populations are long-term population assessments conducted at the nesting beach (Meylan 1982) and these are used as an appropriate index of abundance for the taxon (IUCN 2001a, 2001b). But, estimating the total number of adult females in a nesting population is complicated by the fact that an individual female typically nests several times within a breeding season, and follows a non-annual breeding schedule, with intervals of two to seven years separating consecutive nesting seasons. Individuals also may be reproductively active for decades (Carr et al. 1978, FitzSimmons et al. 1995, Mortimer and Bresson 1999). Long-term monitoring is thus essential to document true population change.&#160;&#160; Few long-term studies of nesting Hawksbills exist, in part because sea turtle research did not become popular until the 1970s, and by then many populations had already been reduced to low levels (Meylan 1999).Interpretation of long-term data can be complicated.&#160; Because Hawksbills mature slowly, an over-exploited nesting population may already be in decline for decades before the damage manifests itself as a decrease in numbers of nesting turtles on the nesting beach.&#160; Meanwhile, documented increases in numbers of nesting females must be interpreted cautiously, as they do not always reflect an absolute increase in the size of the population. In situations where protection is afforded a breeding population that previously had been subject to intense exploitation, numbers of egg clutches laid are likely to rise precipitously at the newly protected rookery.&#160; This is because, with protection, individual females survive not only to lay their full complement of three to five egg clutches within a single nesting season, but also return to breed in subsequent seasons. &#160;Because of the extended and complicated life cycle of the Hawksbill, to quantify only a single stage in the life cycle will not always adequately portray the true status of the entire population.&#160; For example, where over-exploitation of nesting females or eggs has impeded reproduction during long periods of time, estimates of population decline based only on numbers of nests may significantly underestimate the overall population decline at those sites because they will not reflect the absence of juvenile foraging turtles in the wider population (Mortimer 1995).&#160; Although studies on foraging grounds are useful, reliable quantitative data on the size of foraging populations, and especially historical data describing foraging populations, are generally not available.&#160; Interpretation of foraging data is further confounded by the mixing of animals from various nesting populations at the foraging grounds (Broderick et al. 1994, Encalada et al. 1996). Similarly, recent increases on some Caribbean nesting beaches demonstrate the difficulty in predicting increasing numbers of sea turtles.&#160; Although reduced effort in the Cuban Hawksbill fishery has spared more than 55,000 large animals on its foraging grounds since the early 1990s (Mortimer et al. 2007), to date regional nesting increases are still relatively small. Data Sources for Index Sites. To assess long term changes in the nesting populations at each of the 25 Index Sites, we used several types of data sources, often in combination with each other.&#160; For sites for which data on annual numbers of nesting females are not available we used other indices of nesting abundance, including numbers of nests recorded, numbers of nesting females killed, numbers of nesting females recorded per unit of patrol effort, and numbers of egg clutches collected for human consumption or for incubation in hatcheries. At some sites, different measures of Hawksbill abundance were used, including tortoiseshell export statistics, and total numbers of slaughtered animals (including both nesting and foraging turtles). The data were derived from a multitude of sources, including published scientific and historical literature and unpublished reports. We are grateful to the numerous researchers, especially the members of the MTSG Hawksbill Task Force, who generously provided their unpublished data and the benefit of their personal experience to ensure that the most up-to-date information be included in this assessment (see Acknowledgements in the Supplementary Material). As noted in the text and accompanying tables, such information is recorded as in lit. citations. Unfortunately, for sea turtles and other long-lived species, decades of long-term quantitative data are seldom available. Few Hawksbill nest-monitoring projects were carried out in the 20th century on populations that are now depleted or remnants of their former size (Meylan 1999). Nevertheless, to estimate changes in populations over time, the contributions of historically large, but now depleted, populations needs to be considered.&#160; Where quantitative data are lacking, old naturalist‚Äôs records, historic egg collection data, and tortoise shell trade statistics are often the best source of information about populations, and can be used to estimate former abundance and subsequent declines.&#160; Unfortunately, while some excellent information about the enormous trade in tortoiseshell is available, in many areas of the world researchers will never know the full extent of the Hawksbill declines that have taken place before and during the 20th century. For example, Hawksbills were likely found in some numbers along the eastern coasts of the Pacific and Atlantic although now they have become scarce.&#160;&#160; Extrapolated Data For Index Sites.&#160; In the present assessment, where quantitative data are available, population abundance estimates are based on raw data, and linear and exponential extrapolation functions (IUCN 2001a). In some subpopulations, more than one trajectory was exhibited over the 3-generation interval; changes in subpopulation size are thus often based on a combination of raw data and extrapolations. If no change is believed to have occurred outside the time interval for which published abundance data are available, we use the raw data to determine the change in population size. However, when it appeared that change in subpopulation abundance occurred outside the interval for which raw data were available, we used extrapolation techniques to determine the overall change. Linear extrapolations were used when it was believed that the same amount of change occurred each year, irrespective of total subpopulation size. Exponential extrapolations were used when it was believed that change was proportional to the subpopulation size. In cases where there is a lack of information on the specific rate of change, we used both linear and exponential extrapolations to derive a population estimate. However, when either the linear or exponential function produced an obviously unrealistic number, we included the unrealistic figures in the tables summarizing estimated population change over three generations (and noted them as being unrealistic), but we did not use those unrealistic figures to estimate population changes for the ocean basin under consideration (see IND-Table 3, PAC-Table 3, and ATL-Table 3 in Supplementary Material).Backward Extrapolations of Increasing Populations.&#160; Significant increases in nesting populations during the past two decades have been recorded at a number of nesting localities, particularly in the Atlantic Ocean at the following Index Sites:&#160; Antigua (Jumby Bay), Barbados, Cuba (Doce Leguas Cays), Mexico (Yucatan Peninsula), Puerto Rico (Mona Island), and US Virgin Islands (Buck Island Reef National Monument). The observed population increases correlate with implementation of protective measures at these nesting sites in combination with decreased exploitation at neighbouring foraging grounds (especially in Cuba).&#160; However, most of these now-increasing populations were not monitored prior to implementation of protective measures (the presence of researchers on the beach is often a significant element of the actual protection afforded such sites). Using only the raw data available for these now-increasing sites, it would be impossible to estimate the overall rate of population change during the past three turtle generations, since in most cases data for the protected sites are only available from the mid-1980s onward. There is no reason to doubt that these increasing populations had suffered the same sort of declines as other nesting populations in the region for which earlier data exist. Rather than eliminate these populations from the summary calculations for the ocean basin (and over-estimate the rate of decline), we incorporated these data by extrapolating backwards from 1985, using the average population trajectory calculated for all the other Index Sites in the region for which there are data prior to 1985. The results of these calculations are presented in ATL-Table 6 (in Supplementary Material).Qualitative InformationNumerical historic rates of change in the sizes of nesting populations at the Index Sites describe only one aspect of the global conservation status of the Hawksbill turtle, and tend to be somewhat biased towards those subpopulations for which long-term quantitative data exist.&#160; A wealth of information also exists about the current status of many of the world's Hawksbill nesting populations, as well as the various modern-day factors, both positive and negative, affecting them.&#160; These include:&#160; a) the residual impacts from long-term tortoiseshell trade;&#160; b) current levels of purposeful slaughter and egg collection;&#160;&#160; c) incidental capture in fishing gear; d) destruction of nesting beaches caused by unregulated coastal development, oil pollution, sea level rise and accompanying erosional processes, and elevated incubation temperatures;&#160; e)&#160; damage to foraging habitat caused by sea water warming, and pollution;&#160; and&#160; f) efforts to raise awareness, and to coordinate and legislate protection.&#160; Such information is critical to a complete understanding of the current status of Hawksbill populations around the world. For 58 countries around the world we have compiled information on current estimated population sizes and qualitative information about current trends in nesting and foraging populations, and the factors influencing them either positively or negatively (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material)&#160; The inclusion of such relatively qualitative information ensures that even those countries with the fewest resources for monitoring and enforcement can be represented in this assessment; and these areas are often the ones where greatest exploitation and declines have occurred (IUCN 2001b).&#160; Uncertainties in the Assessment ProcessAs with any assessment based on historic data or small data sets, there is uncertainty relating to the final results of this report. The sources of uncertainty are rooted in the procedure itself as well as in the stochastic nature of Hawksbill biology. Both sources of uncertainty are ultimately related to a lack of information, and when dealing with an animal as long-lived as a Hawksbill, this can be a particularly acute problem. Since the last Hawksbill assessment (Meylan and Donnelly 1999), the IUCN Standarads and Petitions Working Group have developed a system of regression equations to address population changes over time and produce estimates of previous population sizes. With care to filter out overly regressed populations, this system appears to be adequate. Scale of population change needs to be cautiously addressed: on the one hand, declines can go no lower than 100%, but potential population increases are limitless. Small population declines that may be difficult to observe annually can be devastating over several generations.&#160; For example, a hypothetical Hawksbill population numbering 1,000 females declining at a steady rate of 1% annually would have declined by 50% in only 68 years and by 75% in 135 years.&#160;&#160; Another issue of concern is the fact that most of the increasing nesting populations in the Caribbean were included as Index Sites in this assessment, while many declining populations were not included due to lack of data. At many sites, the simple process of monitoring a population offers significant protection. Meanwhile, adjacent unprotected and unmonitored nesting sites may be suffering significant decline due to poaching and destruction of nesting habitat that are unrecorded. A case in point is that of Antigua/Barbuda, where the relatively small Jumby Bay nesting population, which has been intensely monitored since 1987, has increased by 79% (+23 turtles) during the past two decades. Meanwhile, the other 35 known Hawksbill nesting beaches of Antigua/ Barbuda neither have been afforded protection, nor has the status of their nesting populations been monitored (see ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).&#160; We are concerned that in the Atlantic Ocean, protected populations are over-represented in our assessment, thus causing the assessment to under-estimate the true rate of regional population decline. Seychelles, in the Indian Ocean, is one of the few places in the world where records of long-term monitoring of both protected and unprotected beaches are available (see IND-Table 4 in Supplementary Material).&#160; For the inner islands of Seychelles, monitoring was conducted at all 22 islands during both the early 1980s and the early 2000s. Nesting populations at the two islands that had been well-protected since the 1970s increased by 389% during a period of two decades; meanwhile, the nesting populations at 13 islands that had received no protection prior to 1994 declined by 59% during the same period.&#160; When all 22 of the inner islands are considered together, there was an overall decline of 24% in the total nesting population between the early 1980s and the early 2000s.","HabitatsHawksbills nest on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the tropics and subtropics. They are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Witzell 1983). Available data indicate that newly emerged hatchlings enter the sea and are carried by offshore currents into major gyre systems where they remain until reaching a carapace length of some 20 to 30 cm. At that point they recruit into a neritic developmental foraging habitat that may comprise coral reefs or other hard bottom habitats, sea grass, algal beds, or mangrove bays and creeks (Musick and Limpus 1997) or mud flats (R. von Brandis unpubl. data). As they increase in size, immature Hawksbills typically inhabit a series of developmental habitats, with some tendency for larger turtles to inhabit deeper sites (van Dam and Diez 1997, Bowen et al. 2007). Once sexually mature, they undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and breeding areas at intervals of several years (Witzell 1983, Dobbs et al. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999). Global population genetic studies have demonstrated the tendency of female sea turtles to return to breed at their natal rookery (Bowen and Karl 1997), even though as juveniles they may have foraged at developmental habitats located hundreds or thousands of kilometers from the natal beach. While Hawksbills undertake long migrations, some portion of immature animals may settle into foraging habitats near their beaches of origin (Bowen et al. 2007).Roles in the Ecosystem&#160; Like other species of sea turtles, Hawksbills contribute to marine and coastal food webs and transport nutrients within the oceans (Bouchard and Bjorndal 2000). Hawksbills are important components of healthy coral reef ecosystems and are primarily spongivorous in the Caribbean (Meylan 1988), but more omnivorous in the Indo-Pacific (review by Bjorndal 1997). They consume relatively large amounts of algae in northern Australia (Whiting 2000 cited in S. Whiting in litt. to J. Mortimer 4 Jun 2007), soft corals in the Great Barrier Reef region (C. Limpus unpublished data), and other combinations of forage depending on habitat (in Seychelles, J. Mortimer and R. von Brandis unpublished data; in Barbados, B. Krueger unpublished data). At sites where they are primarily spongivorous, Hawksbills have been found to support healthy reefs by controlling sponges which would otherwise out-compete reef-building corals for space (Hill 1998, Le√≥n and Bjorndal 2002, Bjorndal and Jackson 2003).","Threats: The most important threats to Hawksbill turtles, described here, are dealt with in greater detail in the section entitled Regional Overview (see Supplementary Material).Tortoiseshell Trade. Recent and historical tortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material). Within the last 100 years, millions of Hawksbills have been killed for the tortoiseshell markets of Europe, the United States and Asia. The global plight of the Hawksbill in the latter half of the 20th Century has been recognized by the inclusion of the species in the most threatened category of IUCN‚Äôs Red List since 1968 and the listing of all Hawksbill populations on Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, since 1977. Nevertheless, trade continued at exceptionally high levels for years as major trading countries acceded to CITES and Japan, the world‚Äôs largest consumer of bekko (tortoiseshell), continued to import shell under a CITES reservation (exception) until 1993. During the period 1950-1992, Japan‚Äôs bekko imports were the equivalent of 1,329,044 large turtles (1,408,787 kg). Conservatively estimating that 30% of the turtles taken for the trade were nesting females, nearly 400,000 adult female Hawksbills were killed for the Japanese market in those years, a time frame that approximates a single Hawksbill generation. Significant domestic trade in Hawksbill products continues to be a major problem in many countries and, despite international and domestic prohibitions and the lessening of the volume in the last decade, trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas and southeast Asia (Fleming 2001, Chac√≥n 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006).Egg Collection. Intense levels of egg exploitation continue in many parts of the world (see IND-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material), especially southeast Asia, where it approaches 100% in many areas (see PAC-Tables 4 and 5 in Supplementary Material).Slaughter for Meat. Adult and juvenile Hawksbills are still killed for meat in many areas (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).&#160; In some places the meat is used by fishermen as shark bait (J. Mortimer unpubl. data, C. Lagueux, unpubl. data). Fishermen who target lobster and reef fish will commonly take whatever hawksbills they encounter (Carr and Meylan 1980).Destruction of Nesting Habitat. Tropical coastlines are rapidly being developed for tourism which often leads to destruction of nesting habitat (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material). Because Hawksbills prefer to nest under vegetation they are particularly impacted by beach-front development and clearing of dune vegetation. Daytime nesting Hawksbills in the Western Indian Ocean are particular sensitive to disturbance from human activity on the coast and in nearshore waters (Mortimer 2004). In other parts of the world such as the Middle East and Western Australia gas and oil refineries seriously disrupt nesting habitat (see IND-Table 5 and PAC-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).Destruction of Foraging Habitat. Hawksbills are typically associated with coral reefs, which are among the world‚Äôs most endangered marine ecosystems (Wilkinson 2000). Climate change has led to massive coral bleaching events with permanent consequences for local habitats (Sheppard 2006) (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).Hybridisation of Hawksbills with Other Species. At certain sites where Hawksbill numbers are particularly low, they regularly hybridise with other species of sea turtles (see ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).Entanglement and Ingestion of Marine Debris - including Fishing Gear. Hawkbills are particularly susceptible to entanglement in gill nets (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material) and capture on fishing hooks (Mortimer 1998). Juvenile Hawksbills comprised 47% of all turtles entangled in derelict fishing nets and other debris in northern Australian waters (Kiessling 2003, White 2004). Ingestion of marine debris by Hawksbills is also significant (White 2004).Oil Pollution. There is evidence oil pollution has a greater impact on Hawksbills than on other species of turtle (Meylan and Redlow 2006). In some parts of the world (especially the Middle East) oil pollution is a major problem (see IND-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).Tortoiseshell Trade OverviewHistory of the TradeTortoiseshell, the beautiful scutes of the carapace and plastron of the Hawksbill turtle, has been prized since ancient times. Surrounded by legend, tortoiseshell has been described as ‚Äúone of the romantic articles of commerce, not only because of where it comes from, but because of the creatures from which it is obtained and the people engaged in the trade‚Äù (quoted in Parsons 1972). Jewellery and other tortoiseshell objects have been unearthed from pre-dynastic graves of the Nubian rulers of Egypt and excavated from the ruins of the Han Empire which ruled China in pre-Christian times. Over 2,000 years ago Julius Caesar considered the warehouses of Alexandria brimming with tortoiseshell to be the chief spoil of his triumph. By the early years of the 9th Century, caravans of Arab traders carried rhinoceros horn, ivory, and tortoiseshell throughout the Indian Ocean. For the next 1,000 years, the tortoiseshell trade flourished (Parsons 1972). Around 1700, during the Edo Period, the bekko (tortoiseshell) artisans of Japan established themselves at Nagasaki (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987).The tortoiseshell trade has been closely linked to European discovery, conquest, and commerce around the world. The Portuguese, Dutch, French and English played major roles in the global trade; exploitation occurred throughout the world‚Äôs tropical oceans, and especially in the East Indies (i.e., modern day India, Indo China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The East Indies were a major source of the shell of antiquity, and these rich waters fittingly have been called the world‚Äôs most productive seas for tortoiseshell (Parsons 1972). In the insular Pacific international trade did not develop until the mid 19th Century, but once established, it took a tremendous toll on the region‚Äôs Hawksbills. For the next 150 years, tortoiseshell was a prized commodity in the Pacific, first with the sandal-wooders and then with the whalers (McKinnon 1975).European Hawksbill fishing in the Caribbean began in the mid-17th Century and intensified throughout the 18th Century as demand increased (McClenachan et al. 2006). As they decimated local Hawksbill populations in one area after another, turtle fishermen moved from one site to the next. The plentiful Hawksbill resources of Central America were exploited for more than 100 years by traders, including Americans, who established the town of Bocas del Toro on the coast of Panama in 1826 (Parsons 1972). Turtling was still a lucrative business in Cuba in 1885 when the village of Cocodrilos on the Isle of Pines was settled by turtle fishermen who emigrated from the Cayman Islands after its Hawksbills were gone (Carrillo et al. 1999). Over the next 100 years, many tens of thousands of Hawksbills were captured in the rich foraging grounds of the Cuban shelf.20th Century TradeTortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world.&#160; In the early 20th Century, tortoiseshell was imported for luxury markets in Europe, the United States and Asia as the manufacture of combs and brushes, jewellery boxes, and tortoiseshell ornaments was ‚Äúan established industry in almost every civilized country‚Äù (Seale 1917). Declines in Hawksbill populations were obvious in many areas by the first part of the century, as exemplified by expressions of ‚Äúwanton destruction‚Äù in the Virgin Islands (Schmidt 1916) and over exploitation in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) (Dammerman 1929). Although existing records document an extensive trade in many countries, such as the 8,000 Hawksbills (8,000 kg) taken annually in the Philippines for the shell trade to Japan during World War I (Seale 1917) and 160,700 Hawksbills killed between 1918-1927 in the Dutch East Indies for export to Japan, Singapore and the Netherlands (Dammerman 1929), records for many other areas are incomplete.During the 20th century, Japan was the world‚Äôs largest importer of tortoiseshell (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Although data are not available for imports in the first half of the century, Japanese statistics document the import of shell equivalent to more than 1.3 million large Hawksbills from around the world between 1950-1992 and more than 575,000 stuffed juveniles from Asia between 1970-1986 (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Local trade in stuffed Hawksbills also flourished in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and the Americas, especially in tourist areas. When Japanese, European, American and other Asian imports are considered along with the large quantities of tortoiseshell used locally in places like Sri Lanka and Madagascar, it is readily apparent that some millions of Hawksbills were killed for the tortoiseshell trade in the last 100 years.Hawksbills and CITES&#160;&#160; In 1975, in recognition of its threatened status, the Hawksbill was included on Appendices I (Atlantic population) and II (Pacific population) of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, when the Convention came into force. By 1977 the entire species was moved to Appendix I to prohibit all international trade. Nevertheless, the global trade continued for a number of years, in large part driven by Japanese demand. At the end of 1992, Japanese imports ceased, but the industry continues to operate with stockpiled material.In the late 1970s more than 45 countries were involved in exporting and importing raw shell, with annual Japanese imports the equivalent of about 37,700 turtles (40,000 kg).Export and import levels remained exceptionally high until the mid-1980s as major trading nations slowly joined CITES. When they acceded to CITES in 1978, France and Italy took reservations (exceptions) to the Appendix I Hawksbill listing; these reservations were withdrawn in 1984 when they joined the EU.When Japan acceded to CITES in 1980, it also took a reservation on the Hawksbill and reduced its annual quota to the equivalent of 28,300 turtles (30,000 kg), based solely on the needs of its bekko industry.In 1985 CITES proposals by Indonesia and the Seychelles to place their Hawksbill populations on Appendix II to allow trade failed at the 5th CITES Conference of the Parties (COP 5). A similar Indonesian proposal at COP 6 in 1987 was withdrawn before the vote.A comprehensive report on the Japanese sea turtle trade by Milliken and Tokunaga in 1987 documented significant amounts of bekko trade with CITES countries. From 1980 to 1985, between 42% and 58% of all bekko imports originated in CITES countries, without proper export documents.In 1989 a detailed report commissioned by the CITES Secretariat found that Hawksbill populations were depleted or declining in 56 of 65 geopolitical units for which data were available and estimated that the annual global nesting population was a minimum of 15,000-25,000 Hawksbills. The authors concluded that the listing of the species on Appendix I was ‚Äúunquestionably appropriate and must be maintained‚Äù (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989).On 1 April 1990, Japan reduced its annual bekko quota to the equivalent of 18,870 turtles (20,000 kg,).&#160; In 1991, in an effort to avoid a U.S. embargo of its fish and fishery products, Japan agreed to further reduce its annual quota to the equivalent of 7,075 turtles (7,500 kg) by August 1991, to establish a zero quota on 1 January 1993, and to drop its Hawksbill reservation in July 1994. Japan also agreed to support the re-training of hundreds of bekko artisans. In the early 1990s, in response to the end of the Japanese trade, Cuba reduced its annual Hawksbill fishery quota from 5,000 turtles to 500.Since 1994, officials in Seychelles and Zanzibar have acquired tortoiseshell stocks from local artisans and subsequently burned them to demonstrate a commitment to ending the tortoiseshell trade (Khatib et al. 1996, Mortimer 1999). Cape Verde has shown similar commitment (Fretey et al. 2002).In 1997 and 2000, at CITES COP 10 and COP 11, Cuba proposed to sell its stockpiled tortoiseshell to Japan, and also proposed a continuation of the international trade in tortoiseshell taken from the 500 Hawksbills still captured each year. All these proposals failed.In response to regional disagreement generated by Cuban interest in moving Caribbean Hawksbills from Appendix I to II, the CITES Secretariat convened two regional Hawksbill dialogues in 2001 and 2002. The Dialogues encouraged regional cooperation by helping to establish Hawksbill priorities. As a result, resources for research, management and conservation have been generated.Although the tortoiseshell trade continues to threaten Hawksbills in numerous places, overall volume is substantially reduced. Thirty years after CITES came into force, the ban on international trade demonstrates its value over time in protecting Hawksbills. Above all, nesting increases in the Caribbean coincide with the enormous reduction in Hhawksbill fishing in Cuban waters.In June 2007, Cuba informed CITES COP 14 that it would voluntarily institute a moratorium on its sea turtle fisheries in 2008. Although Cuba has a CITES Hawksbill reservation (exception) and reserves its right to dispose of its tortoiseshell stockpile, most nations are members of CITES and therefore cannot legally trade in tortoiseshell.The Japanese Tortoiseshell TradeTwenty years ago, in their landmark report on Japan‚Äôs sea turtle trade, Milliken and Tokunaga (1987) focused on providing estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills (and other species of sea turtles) represented by trade data so that the effect of Japanese exploitation around the world could be assessed. In particular, they cautioned that past exploitation is relevant to understanding and predicting current sea turtle population trends.Estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills involved in the tortoiseshell trade are based on conversion factors calculated for each region by Milliken and Tokunaga (1987). Globally, the average Hawksbill produces 1.06 kg of tortoiseshell; but regionally, conversions are 0.74 kg in the Indian Ocean; 0.75 kg in Asia; 0.88 kg in Oceania; and 1.34 kg in the Caribbean. A combination of factors likely accounts for these differences, including regional variation in average adult size, as well as the relative proportion of adult and immature turtles represented in the trade. Some reports indicate that in the past the average turtle produced more shell than in recent decades. Adult turtles that survive long enough will continue to grow, so it follows that the average size of nesting animals tends to decline in an over-exploited population. In other cases, once nesting populations have been destroyed, hunters may shift their focus to foraging turtles which usually include immature animals. In the absence of specific historical information documenting the size classes of animals killed, the conversions we use in the present assessment are based on estimates provided by Milliken and Tokunaga. Based on the trade through 1992 (when legal Japanese imports ceased), the following information reveals the extent of the Japanese exploitation of global Hawksbill populations and the percent contribution of different regions to overall imports during 1950-1992.Caribbean and Latin America (44.2%): 29 countries provided the shell of 460,220 turtles (616,695 kg). Exports from Panama and Cuba were the equivalent of 152,070 and 106,948 turtles (203,774 kg and 170,047 kg, respectively), making them the most important sources of bekko in the world for Japan. Panama hosted the region‚Äôs largest nesting Hawksbill assemblages until the latter part of the 20th Century. After 1961, Hawksbills in the Cuban trade were captured only at sea, but comprised adult and large immature animals.Asia (20.8%): nine countries provided the shell of 387,020 turtles (290,265 kg). Exports from Indonesia were the equivalent of 155,654 turtles (116,741 kg), making it the most important source in the region and the third largest global supplier to Japan. Much of the shell exported from Singapore to Japan was probably of Indonesian origin (118,535 turtles, 88,901 kg). Asia was nearly the sole source of Japan‚Äôs stuffed juvenile Hawksbill imports, as discussed below.North America (15.1%): the United States provided Japan with the shell of 199,490 turtles (211,463 kg) in two very large shipments, 142,241 kg in 1951 and 68,402 in 1954. The countries of origin are unknown, but in all likelihood some quantity originated in U.S. Caribbean and Pacific territories.Indian Ocean and East Africa (8.7%): 15 countries provided the shell of 164,828 turtles (121,973 kg). Kenya and Tanzania, regional collection points, were the major exporters. Countries in the northwestern Indian Ocean are notably absent from Japanese import statistics. As a non-CITES country, Maldives figured prominently in the trade after 1984 despite its national legislation protecting Hawksbills. Japanese imports therefore were in contravention of CITES Conf. Res. 4.25, which requires a nation with a reservation to treat an Appendix I species as Appendix II, with valid export documents from the country of origin.Oceania (5.8%): six countries provided the shell of 92,124 turtles (81,069 kg). A significant proportion of this trade is attributed to Australia until 1977 (29,109 turtles; 25,616 kg). Solomon Islands and Fiji were also important suppliers, especially in the final years of trading, with 40,982 and 14,490 turtles (36,064 and 12,751 kg, respectively). Fiji banned all tortoiseshell exports in January 1991 (Daly, 1991) but domestic tourist trade in Hawksbill curios and whole carapaces continues (see PAC-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).Europe and West Africa (5.4%): 10 countries provided the shell of 70,560 turtles (74,793 kg). The Netherlands was the largest exporter with the equivalent of 44,775 turtles (47,461 kg), but the source of this shell is unknown.In the 1970s, small lacquered Hawksbills became popular in Japan as symbols of long life. From 1970-1986 Japan imported 576,702 juvenile Hawksbills, mostly from Indonesia and Singapore but also from Taiwan, Province of China (32,075), the Ryukyus (13,438), Philippines (8698), Viet Nam (1195), Hong Kong (3549), and small quantities from a handful of other nations. Japan subsequently prohibited the trade, but continued to allow dealers to sell stocks acquired before July 1994. In December 1999, the dealers reported that they had a total of 135 stuffed sea turtles (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).Numerous irregularities in bekko imports occurred in the final years of Japan‚Äôs trade under its CITES reservation. These included imports of shell from non-CITES countries that did not legally allow export of shell, as well as imports from countries known to have had too few turtles to supply the shell attributed to them. Based on these data, Japanese bekko imports from 11 of the 14 countries reported by the dealers in 1989 were illegal.The bekko stockpile in Japan includes raw shell and finished products. After Japan banned all imports in January 1993, annual Japanese domestic sales from stockpiled supplies remained high. Between July 1995 and July 1998 the stockpile was reduced from 188.4 to 102.73 tonnes (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000). Information on subsequent annual sales and use is not available, but supplies would now be exhausted if utilization had continued at 28 tonnes a year after July 1998.Today, however, the bekko industry is intact, and Japanese consumer demand remains high. In January 2000, the valuable raw shell from abdominal plates ranged in price from JPY 30,000 per kg to JPY 150,000 per kg (US $ 294-$1470 at that time) (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).21st Century Global TradeSignificant domestic trade in Hawksbill products is a major problem in many countries and, despite prohibitions on international trade and a reduction in its volume in the last decade, international and domestic trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas, Asia, and parts of Africa (Fleming 2001, Chacon 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).Some Japanese dealers have continued to import shell illegally as evidenced by numerous bekko shipments intercepted en route to or in Japan since the ban took effect (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000) and ongoing underground trade in southeast Asia to Japan and other destinations (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004).More than a decade after the Japanese prohibition on bekko imports took effect, van Dijk and Shepherd (2004) reported the interest of the Japan Bekko Association in acquiring Indonesia‚Äôs remaining stockpiles of bekko.Although the volume of trade in Indonesia diminished significantly between 1991 and 2001, it is still substantial. The collection of tortoiseshell still occurs in numerous places, with most of the trade appearing to be disorganized and underground. Western Sumatra, Nias, and Papua are areas where significant exploitation and trade are known or suspected (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).Those familiar with the trade warn that Indonesian stockpiles should be seized ‚Äúas any indication of resumption of international trade of bekko could lead to requests from Indonesian traders to be allowed to sell their stockpiles‚Äù (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).Surveys in Viet Nam in 2002 revealed an active international trade in tortoiseshell that had increased since 1999.&#160; Shell was purchased by tourists and foreigners buying in bulk for export to Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan (Province of China), Thailand, China and Asian communities in North America and Europe. Viet Nam subsequently instituted full protection for the Hawksbill (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC East Asia 2004).In recent reviews of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican Republic, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela, researchers provided evidence of extensive clandestine trade in sea turtles, including Hawksbills.&#160; Management and law enforcement are inadequate throughout the region (Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).On 1 February 2007, the Kyodo News of Japan reported that Cuba would not seek to re-open the international tortoiseshell trade at the upcoming CITES meeting and noted Japanese disappointment given the long term support provided for the bekko industry. During 1991-2006, the Japanese government spent 735 million yen (US $6M) for research on Hawksbill resources and 140 million yen (US $1.1M) for projects to resume international trade, including trade with Cuba. The article also reported that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will support the bekko industry for another five years.","Generation LengthGeneration length is defined as the age to maturity plus one half the reproductive longevity (Pianka 1974). Hawksbills mature very slowly, taking 20 to 40 years, and so are long-lived (Chaloupka and Musick 1997). In the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, Hawksbills may mature in 20 or more years (Boulon 1983, 1994; Diez and van Dam 2002; Krueger in litt. 2006). Age to maturity in the Indo-Pacific requires a minimum of 30-35 years (Limpus 1992; Limpus and Miller 2000; Mortimer et al. 2002, 2003). In northeastern Australia, first breeding is estimated to occur at 31-36 years for females and 38 years for males (Limpus and Miller 2000).Data on reproductive longevity in Hawksbills are limited, but becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches.&#160; During the last decade, numerous individual Caribbean Hawksbills have been recorded actively nesting over a period of 14-22 years (C.E. Diez in litt. 2006, Z. Hillis-Starr in litt. 2006, Parrish and Goodman 2006). In the Indo-Pacific&#160; Mortimer and Bresson (1999) and Limpus (1992) have reported nesting over 17-20 years, comparable to other Chelonid turtles which range from 20 to 30 years (Carr et al. 1978, FitzSimmons et al. 1995).Given estimated ages to maturity of 25 years in the Caribbean and 35 years in the Indo-Pacific, with half of reproductive longevity estimated at 10 years, a conservative generation length of 35 years (25 + 10 years) is calculated for the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, and 45 years (35 + 10 years) in the Indo-Pacific. In analyzing the data, declines over three generations are therefore measured for up to 105 years in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic and up to 135 years in the Indo-Pacific. In fact, generation length may well have been longer in the days when population density was higher (Bjorndal et al. 2000). Nesting Population Size and FecunditySea turtle population trends are best diagnosed using in-water abundance estimates coupled with estimates of demographic parameters such as survival and recruitment possibilities (Chaloupka and Limpus 2001, Bjorndal et al. 2005). However, these data rarely exist for sea turtle populations and so most assessments are based on evaluating nesting trends, which assumes a close correlation between population trends and nesting activity (Bjorndal et al. 2005).&#160;For this assessment the size of a nesting population is defined as the average number of individual females nesting per year. In some cases, population numbers can be determined by saturation tagging of nesting females or by recording the total number of slaughtered nesters. More often, however, population estimates need to be derived from records of the total number of egg clutches laid during a season. Saturation tagging of nesting females indicates that at most sites the average female Hawksbill lays between three and five egg clutches during a single nesting season (Richardson et al. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999), with indications that newly recruited females lay fewer egg clutches (Mortimer and Bresson 1999, Beggs et al. 2006), and possibly fewer clutches in the Arabian/Persian Gulf (Pilcher 1999). Following the pattern of earlier status reviews, the present assessment calculates the annual number of nesting females by dividing the total number of egg clutches recorded, by three to five to produce a bracketed population estimate.Population Trends and ConclusionsIn many parts of the world, Hawksbill populations have continued to decline since the publication of the previous Red List Assessment (Meylan and Donnelly 1999). Continuing losses in southeast Asia are of particular concern. Hawksbills face multiple, severe threats. The volume of the tortoiseshell trade has diminished, yet it remains active and substantial, and the Japanese bekko industry remains intact.In 2001 the IUCN Red List Standards and Petitions Subcommittee upheld the Critically Endangered listing of the Hawksbill, based on ongoing and long-term declines in excess of 80% within the time frame of three generations and ongoing exploitation (IUCN 2001b). The Subcommittee review cited ‚Äúconvincing evidence of reductions in excess of 80% over the last three generations at many, if not most of the important breeding sites throughout the global range of the species‚Äù. Not surprisingly, those declines reflect the intensity of the tortoiseshell trade in the 20th Century. Although some relatively large populations still exist, especially in Australia, this is not inconsistent with long-term global or even regional population reduction over three generations (a point noted by the Subcommittee). Unlike previous reviews of the status of the Hawksbill, the present assessment is quantitative and provides a numerical basis for the global listing of the species as Critically Endangered. The 2001 findings of the IUCN Red List Standards and Petitions Subcommittee are as valid today as they were six years ago.The current assessment clearly demonstrates the importance of protection in both terrestrial and marine habitats. With protection, some populations have stabilized, and others are now increasing, most notably in the Caribbean. The increases documented in the Caribbean coincide with dramatic reductions in take on the foraging grounds of Cuba which have, in effect, spared tens of thousands of large Hawksbills since the early 1990s. Such increases provide hope for the future, but unfortunately are still the exception rather than the rule. Similar results are needed elsewhere.",Decreasing,"The Hawksbill has a circumglobal distribution throughout tropical and, to a lesser extent, subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. Hawksbills are migratory and individuals undertake complex movements through geographically disparate habitats during their lifetimes. Hawksbill nesting occurs in at least 70 countries, although much of it now only at low densities. Their movements within the marine environment are less understood, but Hawksbills are believed to inhabit coastal waters in more than 108 countries (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989, Baillie and Groombridge 1996; see Regional Overviews in Supplementary Material).","Tortoiseshell Trade OverviewHistory of the TradeTortoiseshell, the beautiful scutes of the carapace and plastron of the Hawksbill turtle, has been prized since ancient times. Surrounded by legend, tortoiseshell has been described as ‚Äúone of the romantic articles of commerce, not only because of where it comes from, but because of the creatures from which it is obtained and the people engaged in the trade‚Äù (quoted in Parsons 1972). Jewellery and other tortoiseshell objects have been unearthed from pre-dynastic graves of the Nubian rulers of Egypt and excavated from the ruins of the Han Empire which ruled China in pre-Christian times. Over 2,000 years ago Julius Caesar considered the warehouses of Alexandria brimming with tortoiseshell to be the chief spoil of his triumph. By the early years of the 9th Century, caravans of Arab traders carried rhinoceros horn, ivory, and tortoiseshell throughout the Indian Ocean. For the next 1,000 years, the tortoiseshell trade flourished (Parsons 1972). Around 1700, during the Edo Period, the bekko (tortoiseshell) artisans of Japan established themselves at Nagasaki (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987).&#160;&#160;&#160; The tortoiseshell trade has been closely linked to European discovery, conquest, and commerce around the world. The Portuguese, Dutch, French and English played major roles in the global trade; exploitation occurred throughout the world‚Äôs tropical oceans, and especially in the East Indies (i.e., modern day India, Indo China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The East Indies were a major source of the shell of antiquity, and these rich waters fittingly have been called the world‚Äôs most productive seas for tortoiseshell (Parsons 1972). In the insular Pacific international trade did not develop until the mid 19th Century, but once established, it took a tremendous toll on the region‚Äôs Hawksbills. For the next 150 years, tortoiseshell was a prized commodity in the Pacific, first with the sandal-wooders and then with the whalers (McKinnon 1975).European Hawksbill fishing in the Caribbean began in the mid-17th Century and intensified throughout the 18th Century as demand increased (McClenachan et al. 2006). As they decimated local Hawksbill populations in one area after another, turtle fishermen moved from one site to the next. The plentiful Hawksbill resources of Central America were exploited for more than 100 years by traders, including Americans, who established the town of Bocas del Toro on the coast of Panama in 1826 (Parsons 1972). Turtling was still a lucrative business in Cuba in 1885 when the village of Cocodrilos on the Isle of Pines was settled by turtle fishermen who emigrated from the Cayman Islands after its Hawksbills were gone (Carrillo et al. 1999). Over the next 100 years, many tens of thousands of Hawksbills were captured in the rich foraging grounds of the Cuban shelf.20th Century TradeTortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world. In the early 20th century, tortoiseshell was imported for luxury markets in Europe, the United States and Asia as the manufacture of combs and brushes, jewellery boxes, and tortoiseshell ornaments was ‚Äúan established industry in almost every civilized country‚Äù (Seale 1917). Declines in Hawksbill populations were obvious in many areas by the first part of the century, as exemplified by expressions of ‚Äúwanton destruction‚Äù in the Virgin Islands (Schmidt 1916) and over exploitation in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) (Dammerman 1929). Although existing records document an extensive trade in many countries, such as the 8,000 Hawksbills (8,000 kg) taken annually in the Philippines for the shell trade to Japan during World War I (Seale 1917) and 160,700 Hawksbills killed between 1918-1927 in the Dutch East Indies for export to Japan, Singapore and the Netherlands (Dammerman 1929), records for many other areas are incomplete.During the 20th century, Japan was the world‚Äôs largest importer of tortoiseshell (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Although data are not available for imports in the first half of the century, Japanese statistics document the import of shell equivalent to more than 1.3 million large Hawksbills from around the world between 1950-1992 and more than 575,000 stuffed juveniles from Asia between 1970-1986 (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Local trade in stuffed Hawksbills also flourished in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and the Americas, especially in tourist areas. When Japanese, European, American and other Asian imports are considered along with the large quantities of tortoiseshell used locally in places like Sri Lanka and Madagascar, it is readily apparent that some millions of Hawksbills were killed for the tortoiseshell trade in the last 100 years.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Hawksbills and CITES&#160;&#160; In 1975, in recognition of its threatened status, the Hawksbill was included on Appendices I (Atlantic population) and II (Pacific population) of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, when the Convention came into force.

The authors concluded that the listing of the species on Appendix I was ‚Äúunquestionably appropriate and must be maintained‚Äù (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989).On 1 April 1990, Japan reduced its annual bekko quota to the equivalent of 18,870 turtles (20,000 kg,). In 1991, in an effort to avoid a U.S. embargo of its fish and fishery products, Japan agreed to further reduce its annual quota to the equivalent of 7,075 turtles (7,500 kg) by August 1991, to establish a zero quota on 1 January 1993, and to drop its Hawksbill reservation in July 1994. Japan also agreed to support the re-training of hundreds of bekko artisans. In the early 1990s, in response to the end of the Japanese trade, Cuba reduced its annual Hawksbill fishery quota from 5,000 turtles to 500.Since 1994, officials in Seychelles and Zanzibar have acquired tortoiseshell stocks from local artisans and subsequently burned them to demonstrate a commitment to ending the tortoiseshell trade (Khatib et al. 1996, Mortimer 1999). Cape Verde has shown similar commitment (Fretey et al. 2002).In 1997 and 2000, at CITES COP 10 and COP 11, Cuba proposed to sell its stockpiled tortoiseshell to Japan, and also proposed a continuation of the international trade in tortoiseshell taken from the 500 Hawksbills still captured each year.

Although Cuba has a CITES Hawksbill reservation (exception) and reserves its right to dispose of its tortoiseshell stockpile, most nations are members of CITES and therefore cannot legally trade in tortoiseshell.The Japanese Tortoiseshell TradeTwenty years ago, in their landmark report on Japan‚Äôs sea turtle trade, Milliken and Tokunaga (1987) focused on providing estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills (and other species of sea turtles) represented by trade data so that the effect of Japanese exploitation around the world could be assessed.

Exports from Indonesia were the equivalent of 155,654 turtles (116,741 kg), making it the most important source in the region and the third largest global supplier to Japan. Much of the shell exported from Singapore to Japan was probably of Indonesian origin (118,535 turtles, 88,901 kg). Asia was nearly the sole source of Japan‚Äôs stuffed juvenile Hawksbill imports, as discussed below.North America (15.1%): the United States provided Japan with the shell of 199,490 turtles (211,463 kg) in two very large shipments, 142,241 kg in 1951 and 68,402 in 1954. The countries of origin are unknown, but in all likelihood some quantity originated in U.S. Caribbean and Pacific territories.Indian Ocean and East Africa (8.7%): 15 countries provided the shell of 164,828 turtles (121,973 kg). Kenya and Tanzania, regional collection points, were the major exporters. Countries in the northwestern Indian Ocean are notably absent from Japanese import statistics. As a non-CITES country, Maldives figured prominently in the trade after 1984 despite its national legislation protecting Hawksbills. Japanese imports therefore were in contravention of CITES Conf. Res. 4.25, which requires a nation with a reservation to treat an Appendix I species as Appendix II, with valid export documents from the country of origin.Oceania (5.8%): six countries provided the shell of 92,124 turtles (81,069 kg). A significant proportion of this trade is attributed to Australia until 1977 (29,109 turtles; 25,616 kg).&#160; Solomon Islands and Fiji were also important suppliers, especially in the final years of trading, with 40,982 and 14,490 turtles (36,064 and 12,751 kg, respectively). Fiji banned all tortoiseshell exports in January 1991 (Daly, 1991) but domestic tourist trade in Hawksbill curios and whole carapaces continues (see PAC-Table 5 in attached PDF; see link below).Europe and West Africa (5.4%): 10 countries provided the shell of 70,560 turtles (74,793 kg). The Netherlands was the largest exporter with the equivalent of 44,775 turtles (47,461 kg), but the source of this shell is unknown.In the 1970s, small lacquered Hawksbills became popular in Japan as symbols of long life. From 1970-1986 Japan imported 576,702 juvenile Hawksbills, mostly from Indonesia and Singapore but also from Taiwan, Province of China (32,075), the Ryukyus (13,438), Philippines (8698), Viet Nam (1195), Hong Kong (3549), and small quantities from a handful of other nations. Japan subsequently prohibited the trade, but continued to allow dealers to sell stocks acquired before July 1994. In December 1999, the dealers reported that they had a total of 135 stuffed sea turtles (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).Numerous irregularities in bekko imports occurred in the final years of Japan‚Äôs trade under its CITES reservation. These included imports of shell from non-CITES countries that did not legally allow export of shell, as well as imports from countries known to have had too few turtles to supply the shell attributed to them. Based on these data, Japanese bekko imports from 11 of the 14 countries reported by the dealers in 1989 were illegal.The bekko stockpile in Japan includes raw shell and finished products. After Japan banned all imports in January 1993, annual Japanese domestic sales from stockpiled supplies remained high. Between July 1995 and July 1998 the stockpile was reduced from 188.4 to 102.73 tonnes (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000). Information on subsequent annual sales and use is not available, but supplies would now be exhausted if utilization had continued at 28 tonnes a year after July 1998.Today, however, the bekko industry is intact, and Japanese consumer demand remains high. In January 2000, the valuable raw shell from abdominal plates ranged in price from JPY 30,000 per kg to JPY 150,000 per kg (US $ 294-$1470 at that time) (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).21st Century Global TradeSignificant domestic trade in Hawksbill products is a major problem in many countries and, despite prohibitions on international trade and a reduction in its volume in the last decade, international and domestic trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas, Asia, and parts of Africa (Fleming 2001, Chacon 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006). Some Japanese dealers have continued to import shell illegally as evidenced by numerous bekko shipments intercepted en route to or in Japan since the ban took effect (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000) and ongoing underground trade in southeast Asia to Japan and other destinations (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004).More than a decade after the Japanese prohibition on bekko imports took effect, van Dijk and Shepherd (2004) reported the interest of the Japan Bekko Association in acquiring Indonesia‚Äôs remaining stockpiles of bekko.Although the volume of trade in Indonesia diminished significantly between 1991 and 2001, it is still substantial. The collection of tortoiseshell still occurs in numerous places, with most of the trade appearing to be disorganized and underground. Western Sumatra, Nias, and Papua are areas where significant exploitation and trade are known or suspected (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).Those familiar with the trade warn that Indonesian stockpiles should be seized ‚Äúas any indication of resumption of international trade of bekko could lead to requests from Indonesian traders to be allowed to sell their stockpiles‚Äù (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).Surveys in Viet Nam in 2002 revealed an active international trade in tortoiseshell that had increased since 1999. Shell was purchased by tourists and foreigners buying in bulk for export to Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan (Province of China), Thailand, China and Asian communities in North America and Europe. Viet Nam subsequently instituted full protection for the Hawksbill (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC East Asia 2004).In recent reviews of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican Republic, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela, researchers provided evidence of extensive clandestine trade in sea turtles, including Hawksbills.&#160; Management and law enforcement are inadequate throughout the region (Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).On 1 February 2007, the Kyodo News of Japan reported that Cuba would not seek to re-open the international tortoiseshell trade at the upcoming CITES meeting and noted Japanese disappointment given the long term support provided for the bekko industry. During 1991-2006, the Japanese government spent 735 million yen (US $6M) for research on Hawksbill resources and 140 million yen (US $1.1M) for projects to resume international trade, including trade with Cuba. The article also reported that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will support the bekko industry for another five years.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The measures briefly described below are dealt with in greater detail in the Regional Overviews (see Supplementary Material).

The species last spawned in 1994 in the Garonne, where dams, pollution and river regulation has degraded and destroyed spawning sites. There are also plans to start gravel extraction. The current population size is between 20-750 wild, mature individuals (in the past three years there has been substantial stocking, but these animals will not reproduce until ~2016). Under normal population circumstances, the average reproductive age is suspected to be about 25 years. There has been more than a 90% population decline in the past 75 years based mainly on loss of habitat, along with pollution and exploitation.This species now remains in just one location, where 27 spawning grounds (less than 10 km¬≤) remain potentially accessible (the major threat to this species is bycatch). As this species continues to be caught as bycatch, the population is still decreasing.","Biology: Anadromous (spends at least part of its life in salt water and returns to rivers to breed). Males reproduce for the first time at 10-12 years, females at 14-18. There are indications for a reproduction at two year intervals for males and 3-4 years for females in April-July. Adults do not eat during migration and spawning. The distance of the spawning migration seems to be positively correlated with water level, and a distance of 1000 km or more may be covered during years of high water. Spent fishes immediately return to the sea (FAO 2009).Potential spawning grounds have been mapped. Juveniles migrate downstream and are present in upper estuary at one year old. They continue a slow downstream migration and penetrate the sea at 2-3 years. For the next 4-6 years, they leave the sea to enter the lower estuary at summer time where movements and feeding were determined. At sea, this species feeds on a variety of molluscs, crustaceans and small fish. Atlantic population feed benthically.","Bycatch is the major threat and the extraction of gravel in the Garonne is a potential threat to the species. Dam construction, pollution and river regulation have led to loss and degradation of spawning sites.","The sturgeon was an important commercial fish until the beginning of the 20th century (Debus 2007). The last natural reproduction was in 1994 (previous reproduction in 1988). A population assessment in 2005 estimated 2,000 individuals remain. It is estimated that bycatch took around 200 fish per year (gill net and trawling at sea) (Rochard et al. 1997).The size of the population today is much smaller (approximately 20-750 native wild adult fish, based on an assessment of the size the cohort before they leave the estuary). There are more individuals from stocking (7,000 in 2007; 80,000 in 2008; and 46,000 in 2009) (Rouault et al. 2008; Rochard 2010). These have not yet bred in the wild and first breeding (from the releases of 1995) is expected by 2014, F1 generation of 2007 and later releases around 2021. The limiting factor is the availability of females which won't reproduce until ~2016 (Rochard, pers. comm).",Decreasing,"This species was once known from the North and Baltic Seas, English channel, European coasts of Atlantic, northern Mediterranean west of Rhodos, and western and southern Black Sea. It was occasionally recorded in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. The last record from the Rioni (Georgia) was in 1991, although further surveys have failed to find the species (J. Gessner, pers comm.).

It was reported to occur from the tongue of the Ocean east of Andros Islands (about 24¬∞N, 77¬∞W) in the Bahamas.Roundnose Grenadier is one of the main target species of deepwater fisheries in the northeast Atlantic (Lorance et al. 2008). It is currently facing overexploitation in the North Atlantic. The commercial fishery for this species began in 1965, with 1,800 metric tonnes harvested globally and peaked in 1971 at 83,964 metric tonnes. The catch decreased thereafter; the most recent report (2010) is 7,611 metric tonnes (FAO FishStat). This represents a decline of 90% over 40 years.In the northwest Atlantic, a moratorium has provided this species some protection since 1978 and since 1996 in Canadian waters (NAFO 2 and 3). However, recovery rates for this species have been estimated at 22-174 years under minimal fishing impacts (only as bycatch; Baker et al. in prep).This species is slow-growing and long-lived. Maximum age attained from survey samples in the northeast Atlantic for Roundnose Grenadier is 60 years for females and 50 years for males (Clarke et al. 2003), maturation is at age 11 and a modest number (&lt;57,000) of large eggs are produced (Alekseyev et al. 1992, Kelly et al. 1997). Generation length is therefore estimated to be approximately 20 years. Although fisheries statistics are only available for two generation lengths, we assume that the current rates of decline will continue over the next 20 years. Therefore, this species may be afforded some refuge from overexploitation in this part of its range. Globally, it is listed as Critically Endangered under criterion A (CR A4bd).","Coryphaenoides rupestris is a benthopelagic to bathypelagic species that has a depth range of 180-2,600 m (Coad and Riest 2004). They form large schools in depths of 600-900 m. They feed on a variety of fish and invertebrates, but primarily on pelagic crustaceans such as shrimps, amphipods and cumaceans; cephalopods and lantern fishes constitute a lesser portion of their diet. Maximum length recorded is 110 cm total length (TL) (Muus and Nielsen 1999). Maximum weight recorded is 1,690 g (IGFA). Maximum reported age is 54 years (Allain and Lorance 2000). This species is a batch spawner (Murua and Saborido-Rey 2003). Length at first maturity is 50.5 cm. This species is slow-growing and long-lived. Maximum age attained from survey samples in the Northeast Atlantic for Roundnose Grenadier is 60 years for females and 50 years for males (Clarke et al. 2003), maturation is at age 11 and a modest number, &lt;57,000, of large eggs are produced (Alekseyev et al. 1992, Kelly et al. 1997). Generation length is therefore estimated to be approximately 20 years.","Coryphaenoides rupestris is one of the main target species of deepwater fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic (Lorance et al. 2008). It is currently facing overexploitation in the North Atlantic. The flesh of this valuable commercial fish is of excellent texture and taste, and is consumed directly. The fisheries for this species is by factory stern trawlers, which may fish as deep as 1,300 m (Cohen et al. 1990).The commercial fishery for this species began in 1965, with 1,800 metric tonnes harvested globally and peaked in 1971 at 83,964 metric tonnes&#160; The catch decreased thereafter; the most recent report (2010) is 7,611 metric tonnes (FAO FishStat). This represents a decline of 90% over 40 years. However, in the eastern Atlantic portion of its range it is not fished as heavily. Therefore, this species may be afforded some refuge from over-exploitation in this part of its range.Landings of Roundnose Grenadier peaked in the early 1970s at approximately 80,000 metric tons and then declined abruptly (Koslow et al. 2000). As with many new fisheries, the initial quota was set quite high but was never achieved. As catches declined, subsequent quota revisions and reductions were not based on any particular biological or assessment information, primarily because that information was severely lacking (Atkinson 1995). The number of biological papers concerning the species were very few and most basic biological information was not gathered until 15‚Äì25 years after the fishery began (Haedrich et al. 2001). By the early&#160;1990s, the fishery in the Northwest Atlantic was no longer commercially viable and came to a halt.The Canadian survey data have been claiming (in litt.) to be non-representative because they sample only the edge of the population, an unwarranted and troubling assumption. Conservation ecology has shown that trouble at the edge of a range presages trouble over the entire range (Channell and Lomolino 2000, Fraser 2000). Furthermore, deep populations of slope species are not separate from shallow ones because of ontogenetic migrations. Coryphaenoides move up and down the slope seasonally, migrating to shallower water at the end of summer and shifting deeper in winter (Dushchenko and Savvatimsky 1987,Paz and Iglesias 1994). Macrourus also migrate seasonally (Paz and Iglesias 1994) and follow the ‚Äòbigger‚Äìdeeper‚Äô rule in the northwest Atlantic, with smaller juveniles generally occurring shallower than the larger adults (Savvatimsky and Gorchinsky 2001). Savvatimsky and Gorchinsky (2001) hypothesized that Roughhead Grenadier in NAFO Divisions 0B2GHJ3KLMN are a single stock based on size age composition, although the isolation of the Flemish Cap from the Grand Banks by the cold waters of the Labrador Current&#160;render this conclusion questionable.","The commercial fishery for this species began in 1965, with 1,800 metric tonnes harvested globally and peaked in 1971 at 83,964 metric tonnes.

The species may also meet the threshold for Critically Endangered under D, as there may be less than 50 mature individuals in the wild.","The primary habitat is arid and semi-arid bushland and grassland. In Eritrea and Ethiopia, the African Wild Ass lives in volcanic landscape of the Great Rift Valley where they range from below sea level in the Dalool Depression to 2,000 m (Moehlman et al. 2013). In Eritrea and Ethiopia, limited observations indicate that African Wild Asses are primarily grazers, but that they will also utilize browse. Typical of arid habitat equids, the only stable groups are composed of a female and her offspring. Females do associate with other females or with males, but even temporary groups are small. Low density and low sociability may be due to low forage quality and availability. In the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve the preferred forage is Aristida sp., Chrysopogon plumulosus, Dactyloctenium schindicum, Digitaria sp., Lasiurus scindicus, and Sporobolus iocladus (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman et al. 2013). In Eritrea, Pannicum turgidium is an important forage species (Teclai 2006).","The major threat to the African Wild Ass is hunting for food and medicinal purposes; for example, body parts and soup made from bones are used for treating tuberculosis, constipation, rheumatism, backache, and bone ache (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman et al. 2013). Limited access to drinking water and forage (largely due to competition with livestock) is also a major constraint, with reproductive females and foals less than three-months old most at risk. Hence, it will continue to be important to determine critical water supplies and basic forage requirements, allowing management authorities to determine (in consultation with local pastoralists) how to conserve the African Wild Ass (Kebede 1999, 2007; Moehlman 2002; Teclai 2006; Moehlman et al. 2013). The third possible threat to the survival of the African Wild Ass is potential interbreeding with the domestic donkey (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman et al. 2013). However, there is no scientific evidence that indicates hybridization of Equus africanus somaliensis with domestic donkeys (Kebede 2013). &#160;","In Ethiopia, there has been a severe population decline since the early 1970s. Klingel (1977) recorded group sizes of 10-30 individuals in the Danakil, and he estimated a density of 18.6 wild asses per 100 km2 in an area of approximately 10,000 km2. During that survey, Yangudi-Rassa National Park (NP) had the highest density (30 wild asses per 100 km2). In 1994, Moehlman and Kebede did a ground survey of the Yangudi-Rassa NP, but no wild asses were seen, although local Issa pastoralists reported that they were present but rare and occurred at an approximate density well below one animal per 100 km2 (Moehlman 1994, Kebede 1995, Moehlman et al. 1998). Surveys conducted from 1994-1998 in an area of 2,000 km2 indicated that there were approximately 0.5 wild ass per 100 km2 (Moehlman 2002). In 2007, Kebede surveyed the historic range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia (Kebede et al. 2007) and determined that they have been extirpated from the Yangudi-Rassa NP and the Somali Region and that the only remaining population is in the northeastern Afar Region. The total number of wild ass observed during this survey was 25 in an area of 4,000 km2 yielding a density of 0.625 animals per 100 km2. In 2009 and 2010, Kebede (2013) did quarterly ground surveys in the African Wild Ass range and sampled 17% of the total African Wild Ass range in Ethiopia (12,300 km2). The density estimate was computed applying D=N/A where D=density, N total number of individuals recorded, A= sample area (km2). Then the result obtained was extrapolated to the suitable habitat determined using the Maxent model to estimate the population (Kebede et al. 2014). The 2009-2010 survey results indicated that the species‚Äô distribution is restricted to few localities in the Danakil. The current population estimate indicated that this species occurs in low density, approximately one African Wild Ass per 100 km2. Current population estimates indicate that the population size has declined significantly (~94%) since the 1970‚Äôs and 112¬±4 individuals of African Wild Asses are estimated to survive in the Danakil desert (Kebede 2013).In Eritrea, there are limited long-term data. The first successful survey was made in 1996 (Moehlman et al. 1998) and there has been a research and conservation programme with the Ministry of Agriculture and Hamelmalo Agricultural College. The main study site in the Northern Red Sea Zone has had a population of roughly 47 individuals per 100 km2 (Moehlman et al. 1998, Moehlman 2002). This is the highest population density found anywhere in the present range of the species and is similar to population densities recorded in Ethiopia in the early 1970s (Klingel 1977). This is a limited study area (100 km2), but recent research indicates that African Wild Ass currently inhabit approximately 11,000 km2 in the Denkelia desert (Teclai 2006). Surveys and Maxent analyses of suitable habitat are needed to determine the distribution and density of African Wild Ass in this larger area. A rough estimate of African Wild Ass in Eritrea would yield a total of possibly 400 individuals.In 1978-1980, Watson (1982) did aerial surveys in northern Somalia and estimated that there was a population of 4,000-6,000 African wild ass in the area from the Nugaal Valley to the Djibouti border. Given the area covered by the survey, this would indicate approximately six African wild ass per 100 sq km.&#160; In 1979/82 Simonetta and Simonetta (1983) estimated that there were about 250 African Wild Ass in the northwestern Nugaal Valley and that there were about 50 African Wild Ass near Meit, with scattered groups along the coast in the Erigavo region. In 1989 (Moehlman 1998) a ground survey with limited aerial reconnaissance in the Nugaal Valley yielded population estimates of roughly 135 to 205 wild asses or approximately 2.7 to 4.1 asses per 100 km2. This indicates that there perhaps has been a significant reduction in the African wild ass population during the decade between those surveys. In 1997, Moehlman returned to the Nugaal Valley but was not able to survey the entire area. Local pastoralists said that there was less than ten African wild ass left in the Nugaal Valley (Moehlman et al. 2013). Some animals may remain near Meit and Erigavo, but this area has not been surveyed since the 1970s (Moehlman et al. 2013). It is not known if African Wild Ass currently persists in Somalia.In summary, the total number of observed African Wild Ass in Eritrea and Ethiopia is roughly 70 individuals; there may be as many as 600 individuals in these two countries, but this figure is a very rough extrapolation from more intensely studied areas. The number of mature individuals is approximately one-third of the population (Feh et al. 2001), hence the minimum number of mature individuals is 23 and the maximum might be 200. In Ethiopia, in the last 35 years there has been a greater that 95% population decline and in the last 12 years the African Wild Ass has been extirpated from roughly 50% of its range (Kebede et al. 2007). In Eritrea, the population is stable and slowly increasing. However, it is difficult to predict population trends into the future. The desert habitat of the African Wild Ass in both Eritrea and Ethiopia suffers from recurrent and extreme droughts (Kebede 1999).",Decreasing,"The African Wild Ass occurs in Eritrea and Ethiopia, and some animals may persist in Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan and Egypt, but there is no recent information available (Moehlman et al. 2013). Yalden et al. (1996) recorded them to 1,500 m in Ethiopia.Two subspecies are recognized. The Nubian Wild Ass, E. a. africanus, lived in the Nubian desert of north-eastern Sudan, from east of the Nile River to the shores of the Red Sea, and south to the Atbara River and into northern Eritrea (Watson 1982). During aerial flights in the 1970s, wild asses were seen in the Barka Valley of Eritrea and in the border area between Eritrea and the Sudan (Watson 1982). The Somali Wild Ass, E. a. somaliensis, was found in the Denkelia region of Eritrea, the Danakil Desert and the Awash River Valley in the Afar region of north-eastern Ethiopia, western Djibouti, and into the Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia. In Somalia, they ranged from Meit and Erigavo in the north to the Nugaal Valley, and as far south as the Shebele River (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman et al. 2013).The current range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia and Eritrea is approximately 23,000 km2 (Kebede 2013, Teclai 2006). DNA extracted from faecal samples collected from animals in Eritrea and Ethiopia resulted in the identification of five mitochondrial DNA haplotypes: one haplotype (group of polymorphisms) is specific to the Eritrean population (haplotype D); one haplotype specific to the Ethiopian population (haplotype E); and three shared haplotypes (A, B, and C). These results suggest that there is and/or has been gene flow between the subpopulations (Afrera, Serdo) in Ethiopia and the population in Eritrea (Oakenfull et al. 2002).",The African Wild Ass is hunted for food and medicinal products. It is only hunted at the subsistence level.,Terrestrial,"In Ethiopia, the Yangudi-Rassa National Park (4,731 km2) and the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve (8,766 km2) were established in 1969. However, the former has never been formally gazetted, and both areas are utilized by large numbers of pastoralists and their livestock. These areas are remote and extremely arid, and the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA) has not had sufficient funds or personnel for appropriate management (Kebede 1999). In Eritrea, the government designated the African wild ass area between the Buri Peninsula and the Dalool Depression as a high-priority area for conservation protection as a nature reserve. In both Eritrea and Ethiopia, research and conservation programs (Ministry of Agriculture and EWCA) have been critical for sustaining African Wild Ass populations by involving local pastoralists in their conservation. There are no protected areas in the range of the species in Somalia.The African Wild Ass is listed as CITES Appendix I in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. Populations of Somali Wild Ass are maintained in captivity (Moehlman 2002, Kebede 2013).

30,North Africa,Anguilla anguilla,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,ANGUILLIFORMES,ACTINOPTERYGII,ANGUILLIDAE,Anguilla,anguilla,A2bd+4bd,"Anguilla anguilla exhibits facultative catadromy, has multiple life stages, and is semelparous and panmictic; these life history traits made application of the IUCN Red List criteria more challenging. Anguillids are often referred to as ‚Äòfreshwater eels‚Äô, however, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and that a proportion may stay in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters, rarely, if ever, entering freshwater: this element of the population is particularly poorly understood.Ideally, the IUCN Red List criteria would be applied to mature eels at their spawning grounds, and in the absence of such data, the criteria would be applied to silver eels starting their spawning migration (in the case of European Eels, leaving ‚Äòcontinental‚Äô waters), as these represent the maximum estimate of spawning stock biomass, but data sets for this are very rare. The majority of available data relates to glass eels and yellow eels but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement, and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood. As such, the IUCN Red List criteria have to be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which may not exactly mirror the mature spawning stock but can be used as the current best estimate. Finally, the European Eel is a panmictic species, i.e. they come from one spawning stock. Taken literally, this assumes equal importance of the continental populations, and as such escapement from a specific river/country/region is not equivalent to the subsequent recruitment as this relies on the spawning stock as a whole, irrespective of escapement location. However, there are hypotheses that certain regions may have greater importance for the spawning stock, e.g. males primarily escaping from North Africa (Kettle et al. 2011), and as data are only available from certain parts of the species' range - data are particularly sparse for Mediterranean and North African populations - it is important that conservation initiatives and management actions are adjusted as new data become available.&#160;In relation to&#160;A. anguilla, only a very small amount of data are available for silver eels, and while this is not geographically representative of the stock as a whole, a cursory analysis of this alone indicates that the mean decline in silver eel escapement is estimated to be 50-60% over the period of three generations (45 years), just placing them in the Endangered category. There is a similar dearth and uneven geographical spread in the data that relates to yellow eels; however, taking these limitations into account, analysis indicates that there has been a slightly greater decline in this life stage compared to silver eels. Compounding these declines in escapement of maturing eels, according to the available data, there has been substantial declines (90-95%) in recruitment of the European Eel across wide areas of its geographic range during the period of the last 45 years (or three generations) due to a range of threats facing freshwater eels at multiple life history stages. Recruitment has fluctuated during the last century. However, the analysis carried out as part of the IUCN Red List assessment mirrors the WGEEL recruitment index (five year average) which, despite increases in recruitment during the last few years, is currently at its lowest historical level of 1-10% the recruitment of the 1980s, (ICES WGEEL 2013). Further, there is concern that due to the period of time eels spend feeding and growing, prior to silvering and migrating to spawn, that silver eels may continue to decline, even if recruitment is showing recovery.There is a suite of threats that have been implicated in causing the decline in European Eel recruitment and stocks: barriers to migration ‚Äì including damage by hydropower turbines; poor body condition; climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents; disease and parasites (particularly&#160;Anguillicola crassus); exploitation and trade of glass, yellow and silver eels; changing hydrology; habitat loss; pollutants; and predation.&#160;The impact of these threats individually or synergistically, are likely regionally specific; however, more broadly, climate and ocean currents have been suggested to play an important role in the survival and transport of the leptocephalus larvae and recruitment of glass eels to coastal, brackish and freshwater habitat. Further research is required to fully understand the complexities of this particular aspect of the eel's life history but there are conflicting opinions as to the degree, if any, which oceanic factors contribute to broad fluctuations in eel numbers.Eel Management Plans (EMPs) have been developed in European countries since 2007 as a stipulation of the EU Council Regulation No 1100/2007 relating to the recovery of the European Eel. Currently, more than 50% of the 81 EMP progress reports across Europe are failing to meet their target silver eel biomass escapement of 40% in accordance with the regulation, indicating that more work is required (WKEPEMP 2013). Further,&#160;international regulation was enforced for this species&#160;in 2007 when CITES (the&#160;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species&#160;of Wild Fauna and Flora)&#160;listed&#160;A. anguilla&#160;on Appendix II (this came into force in March 2009).&#160;Since this time, exports outside of Europe have been banned due to concern over the decline in recruitment and stocks, however, trade continues within the EU and from non-EU countries within its range to other non-EU countries.A number of management measures are being implemented in line with EMPs,&#160;for example easing of barriers. The influence of these measures, however, will take time to determine as they have only very recently been implemented and very much focus on the freshwater component of the eel's life-history. Arguably the most widely practised measure is restocking; however, there remains a great deal of debate as to whether this benefits eel spawning stocks and thus enhanced future recruitment.&#160;Measures that apply to silver eels, such as fisheries management, and/or trap and transport programmes, can theoretically have an almost immediate effect on the potential spawning stock, although when carried out in isolation, their benefit is significantly reduced.As stated above, the relationship between life-stages is poorly understood, but it was generally agreed that it is very likely that the low recruitment will ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement for, at best, one generation length (15 years). Further, low recruitment has been proposed to be indicative of low historical breeding stock due to the relatively short time period (~2 years) between spawning and subsequent glass eel abundance. As such it was deemed appropriate to assign&#160;A. anguilla&#160;a Critically Endangered listing under current observations and future projected reductions of mature individuals (A2bd+4bd).While this status is unchanged from the previous assessment, it is important to highlight that the process of this designation was very different in that it was carried out as part of an anguillid specific workshop, and that new data were incorporated ‚Äì for example the generation length was reduced. There was general agreement that the situation had improved, albeit slightly, for this species both as far as recruitment and implementation of management measures was concerned. As such it is imperative to highlight that this listing is borderline, and that if the recently observed increase in recruitment continues, management actions relating to anthropogenic threats prove effective, and/or there are positive effects of natural influences on the various life stages of this species, a listing of Endangered would be achievable. Further, a drive to fill data gaps ‚Äì particular in relation to the southern range of this species ‚Äì would allow an even more robust assessment, and we strongly recommend an update of the status in five years. Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from July 1st-5th, 2013.","Habitat: The species is found in a range of habitats from small streams to large rivers and lakes, and in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters. Under natural conditions, it only occurs in water bodies that are connected to the sea; it is stocked elsewhere.Ecology:&#160;The species is facultatively catadromous, living in fresh, brackish and coastal waters but migrating to pelagic marine waters to breed. While there is some understanding of the eel‚Äôs continental life history, relatively little is known about its marine phase. The migrations in the European Eel‚Äôs life cycle are the longest and most oceanographically complex of the anguillid species (Tsukamoto et al. 2002). There are a number of phases in an eel‚Äôs life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach brackish water, before developing into the pigmented, growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.There are no exact data about specific spawning sites, however, it is proposed that spawning takes place in an elliptic zone, about 2,000 km wide in the Sargasso Sea, in the West Central Atlantic (about 26¬∞N 60¬∞W). Survey catches of leptocephalus larvae suggest that spawning peaks at the beginning of March continuing through until July (McCleave 1993). The adults are assumed to die after spawning. Oceanic migration of leptocephali is estimated to take about two years on average before they arrive at the continental shelf (Bonhommeau et al. 2008, Zenimoto et al. 2011). The mechanisms by which leptocephali reach the European and N. African coasts are also not well understood. The main migrations occur in late-autumn to early-spring in Iberian and Bay of Biscay waters, and they are delayed in more northerly sites until temperatures rise in the spring. &#160;By the time the leptocephali reach the continental slope they are as large as 100 mm in size and metamorphose into glass eels which are elongate and have a transparent body. These glass eels are observed in the summer and autumn on Portuguese coasts, and in winter and spring in the North Sea. Glass eels enter freshwater as sexually undifferentiated individuals. Development and differentiation of the sexual organs are thought to be closely correlated with body size and associated with the yellowing phase of the eels life history. Sex determination is principally driven by environmental factors with density dependence producing more males at high densities (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Male European Eels initially grow faster than females, however, females achieve a greater age and size than males when sexually mature. Furthermore, the mean length increases significantly with latitude in females but not males, whereas age increases significantly in both (Durif et al. 2009, M. Aprahamian unpub. data). Male fitness is maximised by maturing at the smallest size that allows a successful spawning migration (a time minimising strategy) such that males tend to emigrate at a length of &lt;450 mm. Conversely, females adopt a more flexible size-maximising strategy prior to migration that trades off pre-reproductive mortality against fecundity (Davey and Jellyman 2005). There is considerable geographic variation in mean length at metamorphosis of male and female European Eels (V√∏llestad 1992). Dekker et al. (1998) produced a paper describing the extreme sizes in each of the life stages of the European Eel from data at a long term capture locality in the Netherlands (Sizes (cm): Min ‚Äì Max, Glass eels: 5.4 ‚Äì 9.2, Yellow: 6.9 ‚Äì 133.0, Silver (M): 21.2 ‚Äì 44.4, Silver (F): 26.4 ‚Äì 101.0). Driven by density dependence, there are often skewed sex ratios at individual localities as well as geographic bias associated with latitude.Eel growth increases with temperature and growth rate is generally faster in saline water than fresh. Furthermore those individuals produced in saline waters usually contain lower loads of the swim bladder parasite, Anguillicola crassus and thus may have improved chances of reaching their spawning grounds (ICES/SGAESAW 2009). During maturation, dependent on size, European Eels feed off a variety of organisms including fish, amphipods and decapod crustaceans. In saline muddy-bottomed habitats eels forage on bivalves, shrimp and polychaete worms.The age at which silver eels mature and undertake their spawning migration is hugely variable and dependent on latitude and temperature of the environment in which they have grown, physical barriers that block migration routes, growth rate and sex differences. From the data available, lower bound estimates for average length of the continental growth phase are approximately 3-8 years for males and 4-5 years for females and upper bound estimates approximately 12-15 years for males and 18-20 for females (Acou et al. 2003, Froese and Pauly 2005, Durif et al. 2009). Assessment of available data on generation length during the IUCN Red List process highlighted that defining a single figure for species such as eels was extremely difficult. Factors that can significantly affect this parameter include longitude and latitude, sex and habitat quality. Fifteen years was agreed upon after this analysis and it is important to indicate that this is inclusive of an estimated two year larval migration and 0.5 year spawning migration of silver eels.","The causes of the declining recruitment rates are still not fully understood (Dekker 2007), and while there are many hypotheses, the significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood. It is important to highlight, however, that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures (listed below), are less likely to have a significant positive effects on eel numbers. The assessment process and accompanying external review indicated that a comprehensive discussion of these threats and their impacts was significantly beyond the scope of this assessment ‚Äì there is a significant body of information including a great deal of contradiction in peer-reviewed and grey literature, and in expert opinion relating to these threats. Below we list (in alphabetical order) suspected threats with some (but not all) key references and a very brief synopsis of these threats ‚Äì this is by no means comprehensive and does not attempt to fully dissect the wide range of views and data on these pressures. As such, a robust and comprehensive analysis of the existing data and opinion on factors linked to decline in abundance of the European Eel would be extremely timely.Barriers to migration ‚Äì including damage by hydropower turbines - Winter et al. 2006, Acou et al. 2008, Azeroual 2010, van der Meer 2012.Body condition - Bo√´tius and Bo√´tius 1980, Sved√§ng and Wickstr√∂m 1997, van Ginneken and van den Thillart 2000.Climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents (including the influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)) - Castonguay et al. 1994, Dekker 2004, Kim et al. 2004, Minegishi et al. 2005, Bonhommeau et al. 2008, Miller et al. 2009, Durif et al. 2011, Pacariz et al. 2013.Disease and parasites (particularly Anguillicola crassus) - De Charleroy et al 1990, W√ºrtz and Taraschewski 2000, Vettier et al. 2003, van Ginneken et al. 2004, Gollock et al. 2005, Palstra et al. 2007, Sj√∂berg et al. 2009, Haenen et al. 2012.Exploitation and trade of glass, yellow and silver eels - ICES WGEEL 2012, 2013; Crook 2010; Crook and Nakamura 2013.Hydrology ‚Äì e.g. Kettle et al. 2011.Habitat loss ‚Äì e.g. Feunteun 2002.Pollutants - Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Maes et al. 2005, Palstra et al.&#160;2006, Geeraerts and Belpaire 2010.Predation ‚Äì e.g. Carpentier et al. 2009, DEFRA 2010, Wahlberg et al. 2014.Summary: One of the major threats to European Eel populations, like many anguillid species, is barriers to upstream and downstream migration, which also includes mortality by hydropower turbines and their associated screens and water management systems. Across Europe, there are a total of 24,350 hydropower plants and this figure is set to rise in the near future (van der Meer 2012). Indeed, in the Netherlands alone there are a total of 4,671 water pumping stations which inhibit the spawning migrations of adult silver eels downstream and the upstream migration of young glass eels. Degradation and loss of available habitat is also exacerbated by development, flood control, water-level management and the abstraction of surface and ground water for both domestic and commercial (e.g. agricultural) use. In North Africa, the declines in fisheries catches of all eel life history stages (but glass eel in particular) have been attributed to over-exploitation, dam construction, pollution of estuaries and water abstraction for domestic use (Azeroual 2010). It is proposed that the decline in good quality habitat and associated resources may be causing a decline in body condition of escaping silver eels in parts of the range which may have effects on the success of migration and/or spawning due this species‚Äô, particularly the female‚Äôs, reliance on fat stores for reproductive success.In relation to this, the accumulation of lipophilic chemical pollutants by maturing eels could have potentially toxic effects on migrating adults. These chemicals are stored by the fish and released when fat stores are broken down during migration which could subsequently limit the capacity of the silver eels to complete their spawning migrations due to metabolic disruption (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Palstra et al.&#160;2006). Further, there is concern that even if the spawning migration is completed that lipid stores containing xenobiotics may result in disrupted gonadogenesis and/or low quality gametes (Robinet and Feunteun 2002).Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in A. anguilla ‚Äì particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment - through its impact on the suspected breeding grounds (Sargasso Sea) and on changing oceanic conditions that can influence the recruitment of glass eels to near shore and freshwater environments. An important consideration in this discussion is the time scale over which changes are thought to occur as a result of oceanic conditions. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associated climate variability that this brings to the North Atlantic have been dated as far back as the Holocene (Kim et al. 2004). As such, fluctuations in climate do occur naturally and have been influencing eel populations for millions of years (Minegishi et al 2005) during periods of increase and decline.The NAO has been studied as a driver of recruitment in both the European and American eel, with published literature arguing for and against this hypothesis. Durif et al. (2011) indicated that periods of high NAO appear to negatively correlate with recruitment to freshwater habitats due to the metamorphosis of larvae into glass eels being impeded by the larvae being driven into colder water, slowing the process considerably. Further, changing ocean climate might potentially be responsible for fluctuations in productivity and thus food availability for leptocephali (Miller et al. 2009). Pacariz et al. (2014), however, found that the overall success of drift of larvae from the spawning ground to the East Atlantic was not affected by changes in climate between 1958-2008, suggesting that trends in recruitment are attributable to factors other than changing currents, a theory also supported by Henderson et al. (2012). As such, the most recent WGEEL report claims that there is still practically nothing known about the dynamics of the oceanic phase of the eels life history (ICES WGEEL 2013).The parasite nematode (Anguillicola crassus), introduced when the Japanese Eel (A. japonica) was imported to Europe for culture in the early 1980s, is also thought to impact the ability of the European Eel to reach their spawning grounds due to its negative influence on the fitness traits associated with the silvering stage of maturation (Fazio et al. 2012) in addition to swimbladder damage which impairs swimming performance (Palstra et al. 2007) and the ability to cope with high pressure during their reproductive migration (Vettier et al. 2003, Sj√∂berg et al. 2009).Overfishing of glass - fisheries are primarily in France, with the UK and Spain also contributing -, yellow and silver eels across Europe is also a threat to the species. Across its distribution all continental life history stages of the European Eel are currently exploited although data from different regions varies in quality and longevity. Export outside of Europe is now banned with any trade occurring within Europe (for consumption, culture and stocking) and quotas are in place, however, under-reporting, poaching and illegal trade are believed to occur throughout the range of the European eel fisheries. These activities endanger the species and make assessment of the impact of this fishery difficult, and it‚Äôs associated management problematic.Given the relative lack of understanding of the threats we have attempted to quantify this using the IUCN ‚ÄòThreat Classification Scheme‚Äô, however, this is by no means definitive.","A subset of the recruitment index data in the ICES WGEEL 2012 report was used for analysis i.e., data collected as part of fisheries independent scientific monitoring or fisheries dependent data with an associated metric of effort (e.g. catch per unit effort (CPUE)). Other data were kindly provided by Dr Brian Knights, and this was included as part of the assessment process. Catch effort can be variable in fishing data, and under-reporting and, in some cases, an absence of reporting of landings is a serious problem in most European countries. Thus landings data cannot be accepted as a precise measure of stock status. However, trends in the reported catch data will, to some extent, reflect true changes in fishing yields. All the data were analysed to assess trends in recruitment, population and spawner escapement; however, it was primarily used to guide discussions that resulted in the broad agreement of the Critically Endangered listing by the assessment team, which was in turn supported by the majority of reviewers.There are more data available for A. anguilla in northern, central and southern European countries compared to North Africa, however there is considerably less freshwater habitat available to the European Eel in this part of its range. For analytical purposes the North Sea subpopulation is often referred to in separate terms to the rest of Europe by ICES. This is because the decline in abundance of A. anguilla has been shown to be substantially greater for this area compared to anywhere else (ICES WGEEL 2012), although this declining trend can be mostly accounted for during the period between 1980 and 1985.Determining changes in the international stock in anguillid eels is difficult due to limited data and the poor understanding of the relationship between recruitment, freshwater populations, and escapement. Not only is there a huge time lag between the recruitment of glass eels to fresh and brackish water and the subsequent escapement of silver eels, but given that A. anguilla are panmictic, escapement from one area does not translate directly into returning larval recruitment at the same locality. Indeed for all intents and purposes it is assumed that practically nothing is known about the dynamics of the oceanic phase of A. anguilla (ICES WGEEL 2013). It has been proposed that due to the relatively short time-span between spawning and recruitment that the latter is a good indicator of the past spawning stock that produced the juvenile cohort; this will depend, to an extent, on the significance of oceanic factors on larval transport.Assessment of these datasets using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria took into account, where this information was available, consistency of sampling; longevity of the data set; whether they were eel-specific or multi-species; whether the collection methods were active or passive; whether the watershed the data related to was subject to restocking activity; and/or whether, in the case of fisheries independent data, there was exploitation in the region.Glass and Yellow Eel Recruitment:&#160;The glass eel data sets used in the analyses for this IUCN Red List assessment were from The Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland, France, and Spain. The elver data sets used were from Norway, Sweden, Ireland and Denmark. These data sets were a mix of fisheries CPUE and scientific surveys and as many were drawn from the WGEEL 2012 report it is unsurprising that they reflect the findings of this document, and they are discussed in this context below.Since the early 1980s, a steady and almost continent wide decline of ~90% has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels. Recently, the WGEEL recruitment index (five year average) fell to its lowest historical level: less than 1% for the North Sea and 5% elsewhere in the distribution area with respect to recruitment from between 1960‚Äì1979 (ICES WGEEL 2012). In the last two years however, the recruitment index has increased to 1.5% of the 1960‚Äì1979 reference level in the ‚ÄòNorth Sea‚Äô series, and to 10% in the ‚ÄòElsewhere‚Äô series, but both remain far from ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô (ICES WGEEL 2013). This could possibly be in response to the closure of silver eel fisheries across Europe in 2009, although this increase is within the natural variation of historical records (ICES WGEEL 2012). Whilst data from catch returns indicate this increase in recruitment, the impact of the overall decline will likely continue to influence adult stock for at least one generation length (ICES WGEEL 2012). Furthermore, the use of fisheries data makes it difficult to assess the full extent of this recent increase in recruitment due to a lack of effort metrics for some data sets and the introduction of quotas which, once reached and fishing ceases, provide no way of estimating subsequent arrivals to coastal freshwater habitat.Yellow Eel: Data sets used to assess yellow eel populations were from Sweden, Norway, Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands and France and were a mix of scientific fishing surveys, electrofishing and fisheries. It was raised that some of the Swedish sites may have exhibited less pronounced declines, and in some cases even increases in population, due to stocking (Wickstr√∂m 1983, Neuman et al. 1990, Andersson et al. 2012).While the decline in yellow eel populations was not as severe as that of recruitment, the available data indicated that it was greater than 50% over three generations (45 years). It is very likely that the less pronounced decline will be partially due to density dependent mortality (Sved√§ng 1999). However, it needs to be taken into account that the age range of yellow eels is broad and that there may very well be a time lag in knock-on population effects. As such, any increase in recruitment would not be expected to be immediately mirrored in a rise in yellow eel numbers, indeed, it is possible that this life stage may continue to decline.Silver Eels: The data sets on silver eel escapement were from France, Norway, Ireland and Sweden and were collected from scientific surveys and fisheries.Silver eel decline was not as pronounced as yellow eel populations or recruitment but, similar to yellow eels, the indication was that the decline across the range was greater than 50% over three generations. Again, this may be due to density dependent mortality at previous life stages, but it cannot be ruled out that a decline in silver eel escapement may continue despite increases in glass eels and/or yellow eels due to the long generation time.The EU regulation 1100/2007 ‚Äì article 2.4 states ‚ÄúThe objective of each [EU] Eel Management Plan shall be to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40 % of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock‚Äù. According to the ICES WKEPEMP report, assigned to evaluate the current progress of the Europe-wide EMPs, out of 81 eel management units (EMUs), 17 EMU are reported as achieving their biomass targets, 42 are not and 22 did not report (WKEPEMP 2013). In southern Norway, sharp declines in abundance have been observed since 2000 after relatively long periods of stability (ICES WGEEL 2012).Anguilla anguilla has been included in a number of regional and national Red List assessments in Europe over the past 10 years. The European Eel has been assessed as Critically Endangered across Europe (Freyhof and Brooks 2011) as well as in Sweden (G√§rdenfors 2005), Denmark (NERI 2009), France (UICN 2010) Norway (K√•l√•s et al. 2010), and Ireland (King et al. 2011) and in regional assessments for the Baltic Sea area (HELCOM 2007) and north Belgium (Verreycken et al. 2013). Indeed the European Eel showed the largest negative population trend of any of the freshwater fishes (-75%) in the Belgian report (Verreycken et al. 2013).For the North African range of the population there is considerably less information. A regional Red List assessment in North Africa suggests that A. anguilla is Endangered due to a decline in recruitment of 50% in the last 10 years with annual catches declining by between 10 and 25% since the 1980s, and by more in Tunisia alone (Azeroual 2010).",Decreasing,"Anguilla anguilla has been shown to be distributed from North Cape in Northern Norway, southwards along the coast of Europe, all coasts of the Mediterranean and on the North African Coast (Schmidt 1909, Dekker 2003). It very rarely enters the White and Barents seas, but it has been recorded eastward to the Pechora River in northwest Russia. The species occurs in low abundance in the Black Sea where it migrates east to the Kuban drainage (occasional individuals reach the Volga drainage through canals), in northern Scandinavia and eastern Europe. A report by the ICES Study Group on Anguillid Eels in Saline Waters (SGAESAW) indicates that eel populations typically contain a mix of freshwater residents, saline water residents, and inter‚Äêhabitat migrants (ICES/SGAESAW 2009). It also widely occurs in most inland waters of Europe (e.g. lakes). It is thought that the continental distribution of the European Eel is over an area of approximately 90,000 km¬≤&#160;in Europe and parts of North Africa (Moriarty and Dekker 1997), with a substantially larger range if their marine distribution is considered. For example, in England and Wales, there are thought to be a total of 2,694 km¬≤&#160;of transitional waters, which account for approximately 68% of the potential eel producing habitat across all 11 River Basin Districts (Defra 2010). For several decades prior to an EU-wide ban on export in 2010, A. anguilla was also exported to Asia for seed stock in eel farms (Ringuet et al. 2002). This species may well have been introduced in some parts of Asia (through escape or release from farms), however these are not thought to contribute to the population and therefore areas of introduction have been excluded in the range information. Anguilla anguilla are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring, before eggs hatch and leptocephalus larvae migrate back across the Atlantic to begin the continental phase of their life history (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup et al. 2009).","The various life stages, ranging from glass eel to silver eel, of all Anguilla species are harvested and traded on a global scale for consumption - directly or after culture - and for stocking purposes, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent ‚Äì when one Anguilla species or population declines in abundance or new catch/trade measures come into force limiting exploitation levels, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Crook and Nakamura 2013).There is clear evidence for this in the case of European Eel. Traditionally, European Eel was consumed within its European and North African range States ‚Äì yellow and silver eels were fished for direct consumption, and glass eels were caught for farming and also for consumption (mainly in Spain). Although still consumed within Europe, in recent decades European eel became increasingly important in fulfilling demand in East Asia (Ringuet et al.&#160;2002).Eel farming, which is responsible for over 90% of all Anguilla production worldwide (averaging at 280,000 tonnes per year since 2007; FAO 2013), is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels or glass eels. Raising European eel larvae to the glass eel stage in captivity has never been achieved, and while it has for the Japanese eel, this is not yet commercially viable. Historically, eel farms used species of local provenance. France, Spain, Portugal and the UK were the principal fishing nations for European Eel glass eels, and Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands the main producers of farmed European Eel, for consumption within Europe. However, towards the end of the 1990s, a decline in stocks of Japanese eels, combined with the apparently cheap and abundant supplies of European Eel glass eels, led to many Asian eel farms in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and mainland China, switching to the European eel for their culture material (Ringuet et al. 2002).Concerns over the impact international trade was having on European Eel led to it being listed in Appendix II of CITES in 2007. This listing came into force on 13 March 2009 ‚Äì since then any international trade in this species needs to be accompanied by a permit. In December 2010, however, the European Union (EU) decided to ban all imports and exports of European Eel to and from the EU, as authorities felt they were unable to determine that trade would not be detrimental to the conservation of the species (a requirement for issuance of permits for CITES Appendix II-listed species). Exceptions to this ban included trade in pre-Convention specimens i.e. those fished prior to the CITES listing coming into force (permitted until April 2012) and internal EU trade. Trade from non-EU range States to non-EU countries is also still permitted (Crook 2011).Fishing of various life stages continues in a number of European Eel range States, but in most cases catch is being limited by quotas or other measures set as part of National Eel Management Plans (fulfilling requirements outlined in Council Regulation (EC) No.1100/2007 establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of the European Eel (18 September 2007) ‚Äì see conservation measures).Anguilla spp. are traded internationally as live eels for farming and consumption, as fresh, frozen and smoked/prepared eels for consumption and as skins and leather products for fashion accessories. Global trade data collated by FAO for live, fresh, frozen and smoked/prepared Anguilla species (non-species specific) is available for the period 1976-2009. According to FAO data, global annual Anguilla exports averaged around 20,000 tonnes in the late 1970s (valued annually at 55-95 million US Dollars), after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 tonnes in 2000 (valued at over 1000 million US Dollars). Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 tonnes in 2008 and 2009 (valued at over 800 million US Dollars). By weight, China and Taiwan are responsible for nearly 75% of these exports and Japan for over 75% of all imports (FAO 2013).Due to a lack of species-specific Customs data, the actual quantities of European Eel in trade is still relatively unknown. However, East Asian Customs imports of live juvenile Anguilla eels from European eel range States for farming purposes (defined as ‚Äúlive eel fry‚Äù in East Asia) can provide a good indication of the amount of European glass eels in trade (due to their delicate nature and the need for quick transportation to their destination). Between 2003 and 2008, annual live eel fry imports from European eel range States to mainland China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong fluctuated between ~36 and 70 tonnes. In 2009, annual imports dropped to ~9 tonnes, in 2010 they increased again to nearly 28 tonnes and in 2011 and 2012 were ~7 and ~5 tonnes respectively - these low numbers are a result of the EU ban in place since 2011. Consequently, increasing quantities of glass eels of other Anguilla species are being imported into East Asia to fulfil demand in farms (Crook 2010; Crook and Nakamura 2013, V. Crook/TRAFFIC 2014, in litt/pers. comm.).Furthermore, since 2009, species-specific CITES trade data for European eel has been reported. Between 2009 -2011, over 360 tonnes of live eels (including 20 tonnes of juvenile eels for farming) were reportedly exported from a number of European Eel range States. Exporters included Algeria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Morocco, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia and the UK,and importers included Armenia, &#160;mainland China, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, Tunisia and Ukraine. During these three years, nearly 30,000 tonnes of A. anguilla meat and bodies were also reportedly exported (mostly from farms in mainland China), in addition to ~11,000 leather products and ~13,000 skins (mostly from Mexico, but originating in Korea) (UNEP-WCMC 2013). Since December 2010, illegal trade in European eel has been a concern ‚Äì authorities have seized several European glass eel shipments destined for East Asian eel farms, in particular coming from Spain and France (TRAFFIC 2012, Crook in litt, 2013).Note: double-counting, under-reporting and misreporting must be taken into consideration when interpreting all available catch and trade data. See Crook (2010) for explanations of data issues.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The majority of conservation actions historically in place for the European eel were set up and controlled at local and national level, often with little coordination which is of particular concern in relation to trans-boundary watersheds.EMPs have been developed and implemented in EU Member States since the EC Regulation 1100/2007 was created to offer protection, promote recovery and increase of silver eel biomass and enhance the sustainable management of this species. The objective of each EMP is to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit, with high probability, the escapement to the sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock. Member States are responsible for implementing measures to achieve their targets, and these measures can include, but are not limited to; reducing commercial and recreational fisheries; restocking; improving habitats and making rivers passable; transportation of silver eels to the sea; reducing predation, amending hydro-electric power turbine schedules to reduce mortality, and developing aquaculture. According to the ICES WKEPEMP report (2013) &#160;most management actions have been for commercial and recreational fisheries, followed by hydropower-pumping stations obstacles, then measures on habitat, restocking, and predator control. Other actions expected to have indirect effects, such as implementing monitoring programmes and scientific studies, have been almost as common as controls on fisheries. A total of 756 management actions proposed in the EMPs have been implemented fully, 259 partially and 107 declared as not implemented at all (ICES WKEPEMP 2013).In addition to EMPs, in 2007, the European eel was included in the CITES Appendix II in order to ensure trade of this commercially important species was sustainable. The listing came into effect on 13 March 2009, after which time all Parties to the Convention were required to issue permits for all exports of the species. An export permit may be issued only if the specimen was legally obtained and if the export is not detrimental to the survival of the species i.e. a Non-Detriment Finding. Finally in relation to international policy, in 2008, A. anguilla was added to the OSPAR List of Threatened and/or Declining Species in the Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR 2010).As part of the EMPs, any Member State that allowed fishing for eels of &lt;12 cm total length ‚Äì generally referred to as glass eel fisheries - &#160;was required to reserve a minimum of 35% of their catch for restocking purposes (i.e. restocking rivers with glass eels from elsewhere) in 2010, rising to 60% from 31 July 2013. Whether restocking programmes actually enhance the population is still open to debate. In recent years, the ICES WGEEL has annually assessed new information on the pros and cons of stocking as a suitable tool for eel recovery, with fuller reviews undertaken in 2006 and 2010 (ICES 2010). Recent reviews (WGEEL 2012, Pawson 2012) on the contribution of stocking for the recovery of the panmictic European eel population unambiguously state that there are major knowledge gaps to be filled before firm conclusions either way can be drawn (ICES WGEEL 2013). To inform this debate, however, researchers are currently seeking to determine whether stocked individuals are able to migrate as successfully and contribute to future generations to the same degree as wild individuals. Long term stocking, marking and monitoring programmes are slowly making progress in this endeavour (Wickstr√∂m and Sj√∂berg 2013). A team of researchers in France suggest that the stage at which eels are stocked does not affect their survival (Desprez et al. 2013). Tagging and tracking studies, such as those being conducted as part of the EU EELIAD project, are under way in order to gain a better understanding of the marine ecology of the European Eel. Tracking is also adopted to determine the relative success of stocked eels to make spawning migrations and thus contribute to recruitment (e.g. Prigge et al. 2013a) and a recent paper indicates that eels from a stocked watershed migrate in a similar way to wild populations in Sweden (Westerberg et al.&#160;2013). In summary however, until stocking studies are accompanied by suitable controls of areas without translocation, it is very difficult to determine whether there is a net increase in silver eel escapement or differences in growth rates and/or sex ratios in manipulated populations (Pawson 2012).Trap and transport programmes across Europe are designed to provide eels with both upstream and downstream passage and/or access to habitat that has been lost through the construction of migratory barriers. These programmes that involve catching wild eels and moving them over relatively small distances past barriers are generally working with lower numbers of fish than restocking programmes and are very location specific. However, when applied to migrating silver eels, low in a catchment, it can have a significant and immediate effect on escapement thus potentially having a positive impact on the spawning stock. It is hoped that translocation can mitigate against the loss of habitat and positively contribute to enhanced escapement, and by association, recruitment. There is a necessity in the future, however, to reduce the level of direct human intervention by providing more cost-effective passes or ladders for eels to navigate.Continuous monitoring of eel escapement on a national or international scale is currently very rare and highly unlikely and so in addition to localised monitoring, modelling has been explored for providing estimates of escapement in eel subpopulations. The German Eel Model indicated that current levels of silver eel escapement from the Schwentine River system showed ‚Äòdistinctly lower reference escapement values‚Äô than those set by the German EMP (Prigge et al. 2013). Indeed a report for the European Commission by Walker et al. (2011) review a number of assessment models (namely the Demographic model of the Camargue (DemCam); Eel Density Analysis 2.0 (EDA); German Eel Model (GEM); and, Scenario-based Model of Eel Production II (SMEP II)) using time series eel data sets from a variety of locations across Europe. The conclusions of this report suggest that all four models were capable of predicting escapement to a degree of accuracy (Walker et al. 2011).In summary, the international assessment of the eel stock collated in the 2013 ICES WGEEL report confirms ‚Äúthe critical state of the stock; the promising increase in recruitment observed in the last two years is set in historical perspective; but no prediction can be generated, and no evaluation of the implemented stock protection measures achieved‚Äù. There is still a critical need for improvement in the quality and consistency of data reporting at the national and Eel Management Unit (EMU) level (ICES WGEEL 2013). Further, it is important to highlight that while conservation actions of varying effectiveness are in place for Anguilla anguilla across its range, more is still required, and the apparent rise in recruitment that has occurred in 2011, 2012 and 2013, should not be reason to cease efforts. It was proposed that reassessment of this species will be required in five years, or sooner should considerably more data on silver eel escapement become available in the next few years.",Palearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

The extent of occurrence (EOO) is 97 km2 &#160;and the area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 16 km2. The species occurs in four locations and the population is severely fragmented. Given the ongoing development of limestone quarries and the size of the existing quarries, the opening of four new quarries could totally destroy the known localities. Therefore, this species is listed as Critically Endangered&#160;B1ab(iii).","The type locality looks like a continental karstic isolated island surrounded by siliceous soils.

It is predated by corvids (Phyrrochorax phyrrochorax) (Ruiz 1998). Other aspects of biology and ecology are unknown. It is probable that its preference for limestone soils increases the aggregation behaviour and explain its rarity.","The species is threatened by the current development of limestone quarries and associated infrastructures, which destroy the habitat.

Historically, this species was moderately common off Tunisia and Malta, and rare off France, Algeria and Italy. It now appears to be mostly restricted to one small part of the Mediterranean Sea, the Sicilian channel around Malta Island, which is subject to heavy trawling activity. In the 1990s, surveys no longer detected this skate in the Gulf of Lion. It was extremely rare in the western central Mediterranean Sea (the coasts of Tyrrhenia, Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily) according to the International Trawl Surveys in the Mediterranean from 1994 to 1999 (i.e., recorded in 20 of 6,336 hauls). It is now more rare off Malta and rare or absent off Tunisia. Maltese Skate is assessed as Critically Endangered under criteria&#160;A2bcd+3bcd as a result of a suspected population size reduction of at least 80% over a three generation period (15 years), based upon its endemism to the region, inferred reduction in the area of occupancy, and inferred population reductions off the Maltese, Tunisian and French coasts. The population is also suspected to continue declining around 80% in the future over the period of three generations. More research is needed on its range, biology, ecology, exploitation, and abundance.","This benthic skate occurs over sandy and sandy-muddy bottoms at depths of 60‚àí800 m, but most commonly 400‚àí800 m.  Little is known about the reproductive cycle of this skate. Breeding occurs throughout the year, though ovulating females have mainly been observed in the spring and autumn (Stehmann and B√ºrkel 1984, Serena 2005). Females produce 10‚àí56 eggs per year (Bauchot 1987). Both males and females mature at ~40 cm total length (TL; Bauchot 1987, Notarbartolo and Bianchi 1998), and the maximum reported size is ~50 cm TL (Stehmann and B√ºrkel 1984). In Italian waters, the size range of this species was reported to be 9‚àí42 cm TL between 1985 and 2001 (Ragonese et al. 2003). Its generation length is suspected to be 4-5 years.","The majority of this species‚Äô geographic (i.e., in the Sicilian Strait around Malta) and depth (400‚àí800 m) range occurs where trawling activity is intensive. The Sicilian Channel is the most exploited region of the Italian coast with respect to the total number of fishing vessels of any kind compared to other parts of the basin. Most of the fleet is composed of multipurpose artisanal vessels using bottom longlines, gillnets and trammel nets, all gear types that are likely to catch this species. Trawl fishing vessels constitute 11% of the fleet (Relini et al. 2000). While this skate is not known to be targeted by commercial fisheries, it is taken as bycatch in bottom trawl, gillnet, and bottom longline fisheries and often discarded (Ragonese et al. 2003). Skates generally have low commercial value in the Mediterranean region, but occasionally this species is present in fish markets. Usually only the large individuals are landed for human consumption, however, there is full retention of all size classes in the cod-end of gears currently used, regardless of mesh size (Ragonese et al. 2001).  Along the Tunisian coast, this species is occasionally caught as bycatch in bottom trawl, gillnet, and bottom longline fisheries, but it is now extremely rare in this area (Bauchot 1987). Maltese fisheries using bottom longline and trawl gear may take this species as bycatch (De Leiva et al. 1998), although Maltese fishing fleets are smaller to those of the Italians‚Äô. Tunisian fisheries are small, coastal and probably operate outside this species‚Äô area of occurrence (Samira 2002).   Benthic trawling effort over the continental shelf and slope in the Mediterranean Sea increased with respect to fishing effort and technological advances over a period of 60 years, although it is unclear if fishing effort will continue to increase within this species range. Fishing effort and catches should be monitored closely.","This is one of only four skate species endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, and has undergone significant declines and a reduction in its geographical range. Historically, its range once extended over about one quarter of the total area of the Mediterranean Sea (at least within the depth range of the main trawl fisheries). It was moderately common off Tunisia, common around Malta, rare off Algeria and recorded once off Italy (Stehmann and B√ºrkel 1984). The range of this skate now appears to be restricted to the Sicilian Channel (Pipitone et al. 1992, Relini 1995, Cannav√≤ et al. 1999), and it is considered rare off Malta (Schembri et al. 2003) and rare or absent off Tunisia (Brada√Ø 2000). In Italian waters, trawl surveys performed by Gruppo Nazionale risorse Demersali (GRUND) between 1985 and 2000 only recorded this species in the Sicilian Channel (20 of 23 hauls in this area; Relini et al. 2000, Ragonese et al. 2003).  In surveys conducted in the northern Mediterranean Sea from the Alboran to Aegean Sea (including off Sicily), the International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) recorded this species in only 20 out of 6,336 hauls between 1994 and 1999 (Bertrand et al. 2000, Baino et al. 2001). In this area, the standing stock biomass of this species was estimated to be 705 tonnes. If the average weight of an individual is ~2 kg, the estimated population size in the MEDITS survey area was ~35,200 individuals at this time (note that this does not include any remaining population around Malta and North Africa).   Records from surveys of the Gulf of Lion infer that this species was present on the continental shelf in 1957‚àí1960 and slope in 1980‚àí1984, but not in comparable surveys carried out in 1992‚àí1995 (Aldebert 1997). However, caution should be taken with these findings because the species could be confused with Cuckoo Skate (Leucoraja naevus), which is widespread in the western part of the Mediterranean Sea.   In a recent study, bottom trawl hauls of commercial vessels operating in the Aegean Sea were analysed three times per year from 1995 to 2000 and 2003 to 2006 (Damalas and Vassilopoulou 2011). A mean nominal catch per unit effort declined by 50% in the number of individuals (from 0.22 to 0.11 individuals per haul) and by 60% in weight (from 0.05 to 0.02 kilograms per haul) between the two time frames. The last encounter with this species in the Adriatic Sea was a single individual recorded during bottom trawl surveys in 2005 (Ferretti et al. 2013). A decline of at least 80% of the population is suspected in European waters based on the fact that it has disappeared from over 80% of its former range over a 15 year period.",Decreasing,"The species is endemic to the Mediterranean. Its range now appears to be restricted to the Sicilian Channel around Malta (GFCM 2012). The depth range is&#160;60‚àí800 m, but it is most commonly found between 400‚àí800 m.",The species is not exploited nor traded commercially.,Marine,"According to the Fisheries and Aquaculture Organisation‚Äôs (FAO) International Plan of Action on the management and conservation of sharks (IPOA-Sharks), all states that capture sharks, rays, skates or chimaeras, either as target species or as bycatch, shall implement national action plans to ensure suitable use, conservation and recovery of threatened species (Vacchi and Notarbartolo 2000).  In 2012, parties to the Barcelona Convention agreed that this species (as listed in Annex II of the Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity (SPA/BD) Protocol for the Mediterranean Sea) cannot be retained on board, transshipped, landed, transferred, stored, sold, displayed or offered for sale, and must be released unharmed and alive, to the extent possible, in the Mediterranean Sea (FAO 2012). Furthermore, the Italian National Action Plan was drafted by the Central Institute for Marine Research (ICRAM) scientific advisory committee to provide Italy with tools needed to ratify the SPA/BD Protocol (Serena et al. 2002, Vacchi and Notarbartolo 2000). The European Commission also drafted a proposal for the European Community Plan of Action that encourages research programs aimed at the assessment of the conservation status of cartilaginous fishes in the Mediterranean Sea (Serena et al. 2002).  Italy should act urgently to establish a plan of action for the conservation and management of chondrichthyans. To mitigate the decline of this species caused by fisheries bycatch, it is recommended that opportunities to ban trawling in specific areas of the Mediterranean Sea be explored. Mesh size restrictions are unlikely to be effective given that full retention in the cod-end of trawling gear is expected for mesh sizes ranging from 16 to &gt;60 mm (Ragonese et al. 2001). The most appropriate management measure may be to define areas of suitable habitat for this species that are also unsuitable for bottom trawling and close them to trawl fisheries in order to protect part of the population and the eggs from exploitation (Ragonese et al. 2003).",Palearctic,,False,False,"Global, Europe & Mediterranean",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

Numbers continue to decline due to poaching and disturbance from oil exploration. Latest field surveys indicate that the species has probably already reached the threshold for Critically Endangered under criterion D (&lt;50 mature individuals).","The most desert-loving large ungulate, occurring in areas of extreme temperature and aridity (less than 100 mm annually) (Newby 2013). With the exception of truly mountainous areas, Addax have been recorded from all major habitat types in the Sahara, from gravelly and sandy plains, to dune fields, sandy basins and depressions, pans and wadi systems; their preference is for harder, packed sands and flatter areas within and between dune fields that support perennial vegetation (Newby 2013, and references therein).Addax are nomadic, wandering over large areas in search of grazing. In the Sahel, movements tend to be north-south in direction, for example from the more arid desert to the less arid sub-desert and Sahel (Gillet 1965, Newby 1978). In central Niger, movement may also be east-west, for example from the open desert towards the better-wooded and more varied habitats of the A√Ør and Termit mountains (Hue 1960). The Addax is well known for its utilisation of extremely desolate, inhospitable, and arid habitats (Dragesco-Joff√© 1993).","The primary factor in the decline of Addax is uncontrolled hunting over many years, a process accelerating with the arrival of motor vehicles and modern weapons in the 20th century. Drought and the extension of pastoralism into desert lands, thanks to the increase in wells, have also taken a heavy toll, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s (Beudels-Jamar et al. 2005, Newby 2013). In recent years, the only near-viable population in Termit Tin Toumma NNR has been subject to disturbance by oil exploration and production and to shooting by their military escorts (Duncan et al. 2014). Finally, political instability in Libya has caused an increase in traffic in the core area of Addax distribution and a new kind of opportunistic hunting has been developed by traffickers (T. Rabeil pers. comm).","Although long extinct in North Africa, Addax were still present in fair numbers in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Chad up until the late 1960s and early 1970s (Newby 2013). In 2013 the total global population was estimated at probably fewer than 300 animals surviving in the wild, distributed unevenly along a narrow, 600-km-long band lying between Termit/Tin Toumma in Niger and the Djourab sand sea in Chad (Newby 2013).&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma appears to be&#160;the last&#160;viable population of Addax in the world, with ground and aerial surveys carried out in 2004&#160;indicating a population of around 200 individuals&#160;(Wacher&#160;et al.&#160;2004). Sightings of Addax have declined since 2007. During a field trip carried out in June 2015 by the Sahara Conservation Fund&#160;in&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma, no animals were seen during a thorough survey including all the shade trees, and only footprints of around 25 adults and three calves were found (SCF 2015a)&#160; An aerial survey in March 2016 located only three living animals; remains of Addax and Dorcas Gazelle were also found, left by poachers (Rabeil 2016). The remaining animals are assumed to have been destroyed or dispersed. It is highly probable that there are now &lt;100 Addax left in the wild, and perhaps many fewer. The species is at serious risk of becoming extinct in the wild.",Decreasing,"Addax were formerly widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley, and present in suitable habitats in all countries sharing the Sahara Desert (Newby 2013). As with other ungulates of the Sahelo-Saharan fauna, the Addax has undergone an unprecedented reduction in geographical range&#160;(up to 99%)&#160;over the past century (Durant et al. 2013). The only known remaining population thought to be viable survives in the Termit/Tin Toumma region of Niger. However, there are sporadic records of small isolated groups and individuals from eastern A√Ør Mountains/Western T√©n√©r√© desert in Niger, and from the Djourab region of western Chad (Newby 2013). Possible rare vagrants from these areas may be seen in northern Niger, southern Algeria and Libya (Newby 2013). There have been rumours of Addax along the Mali/Mauritania border (Majabat Al Koubra), but no confirmed sightings for several years. In early March 2007, the fresh tracks of about 15 Addax were seen in central Mauritania, in an area where they had not been reported for over 20 years (R. Vernet in Newby 2013), but these reports have not been followed up and it is unclear whether any Addax survive in Mauritania.","Addax are subject to&#160;uncontrolled hunting for their meat, horns and hide; and levels of&#160;poaching have increased by both the armed forces and the local&#160;community (SCF 2015b).",Terrestrial,"Listed on CMS (the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals) Appendix I and CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendix I, and included in the CMS Sahelo-Saharan Antelopes Action Plan (Beudels-Jamar et al. 2005).

Prolonged drought is also having an impact on pasture quality (Lafontaine et al. 2005, Scholte 2013).","Numbers of Dama Gazelle have declined drastically since the 1950s and 1960s. The early 1970s population in&#160;Ouadi Rim√© Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve&#160;in Chad, one of the former strongholds of the species, was estimated at 10,000-12,000 individuals, but today the species is very rare in this reserve (J. Newby, in Scholte 2013). Remnant populations are small and fragmented and estimated to number a maximum 250 in total (RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014) and may be even as low as &lt;100.",Decreasing,"Formerly widespread in the Sahara and Sahel zones, but their range and numbers have been extremely reduced. Dama Gazelle are now probably extinct from Morocco and Algeria. In Tunisia, they are believed to have occurred in the south and to have disappeared before the 20th century (Smith et al. 2001). There are historical reports of Dama Gazelle from extreme S Libya, which may represent movement of animals northwards from the Tibesti mountains, but no recent evidence (RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014).South of the Sahara, Dama Gazelle have been recorded across the sahel zone from northern Senegal to Sudan (Scholte 2013, and references therein). They formerly occurred in Senegal during the dry season, or periods of drought, only and are thought to be extinct in Mauritania, and from the Sahel zones of NE Nigeria and N Burkina Faso where they have been previously recorded, albeit rarely (Scholte 2013). There are no recent confirmed records from the Sudan, although East (1999) mentioned it could still occur at low densities in Northern Darfur and Northern Kordofan.Since 2000, Dama Gazelles have been reported from only five sites: south Tamesna, eastern Mali (last record 2006); the Air massif and Termit/Tin Toumma N.N.R. in Niger, and the Manga region and Ouadi Rim√© Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve in Chad (RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014). Much of the former range has not been surveyed in recent years due to political instability and lack of security, and there is a very slight possibility that small groups may persist elsewhere. Unconfirmed local reports suggest that small populations may exist in two other locations, but as Dama Gazelles make long-distance movements, ‚Äònew‚Äô small groups may represent nomads not separate subpopulations&#160;(RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014).","Dama Gazelles are subject to direct exploitation, exacerbated by the introduction of modern firearms and 4x4 vehicles. As well as hunting by nomads and military, hunting of Dama Gazelle by Arab hunting parties has been frequent in Sudan (Cloudsley and Thompson 1992) and in 1998 and again in 2001 in Chad, where it was temporarily, halted after publicity by a local NGO (Scholte 2013). Dama Gazelle gallstones were also highly sought-after, at least in the western part of the species' range, as a talisman (Cuzin 2003).",Terrestrial,"Three of the five existing wild populations occur in protected areas: Ouadi Rim√©-Ouadi Achim, Termit-Tin Toumma N.N.R. and A√Ør-T√©n√©r√© N.N.R. (RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014). Insecurity has affected all of these at some time and still hinders travel to the sites in Niger.Captive Dama Gazelle have been released into fenced enclosures at six sites (although two of these operations have failed) for captive breeding or as part of long-term reintroduction programmes: Morocco (Safia, R'Mila; Sous-Massa: died out); Tunisia (Bou-Hedma: only 3 males) and Senegal (Guembeul and Ferlo Nord, Katan√©). None of these is yet considered a full 'reintroduction into the wild. In total there about 250 (RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014). Approximately 550 are held in zoos in managed breeding programmes and there are an estimated 900 on Texas ranches (RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014). Dama Gazelle is listed is listed on CITES Appendix I and on CMS Appendix I, and is also included in the CMS Sahelo-Saharan Antelopes Action Plan (Lafontaine&#160;et al.&#160;2005).",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,False,False,Global,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

It was discovered in 2011, and, despite efforts to extend the known distribution of this species in two subsequent years, no individuals could be found other than at the type locality; indeed,it was not possible to identify any location that had similar habitat to the type locality. The species qualifies for Critically Endangered based on its restricted geographic range and the inferred continuing decline of the quality of the habitat. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are both less than 1 km¬≤, and are inferred to be declining. There is a single known location and the area and quality of suitable habitat is likely declining and expected to do so in the future due to overgrazing, and agricultural practices (the habitat is surrounded by agricultural fields). It is possible that the species might also meet the threshold for Endangered or even Critically Endangered under criterion D, as very low numbers of individuals were seen on each visit to its only known location (&lt; 15 individuals per visit), however further research is needed to ascertain population numbers.","The habitat used by this species corresponds to a streambed composed of a mix of calcareous gravel and cobbles with shallow water (&lt;10 cm) trickling in a diffuse pattern or forming small pools (&lt;20 cm diameter). Vegetation of the reach was exclusively herbaceous and developed as a continuum throughout the streambed and its margins and was composed of a mosaic of helophytes such as Apium nodiflorum (L.) Lag., Cyperus longus L., Ranunculus bulbosus L. s.l., Senecio aquaticus Hill subsp. erraticus (Bertol.) Tourlet, Mentha suaveolens Ehrh., Scirpoides holoschoenus (L.) Soj√°k and Lythrum junceum Banks &amp; Sol. Submerged, and between the gravel, small populations of Chara spp. algae developed in dense cushions and increase the stability of fine substrate. The vascular plant assemblages were moderately grazed by horses and cattle, which were present in the surrounding pastures and frequently intersected the watercourse to graze and drink from the riverbed. These animals caused vegetation and hydrogeomorphologic disturbance, such as vegetation clearings; impediment of the development of shrub or tree riparian species; trampling of the substrate; and eutrophication. Grazing is needed to allow the open vegetation formations to persist. Habitat quality, AOO and EOO are expected to decline given the increasing human pressure in the area.","There is a single known locality and the area and quality of suitable habitat is likely declining currently, and is expected to decline in future due to overgrazing, and agricultural practices (the habitat is surrounded by agricultural fields).

36,North Africa,Rhynchobatus australiae,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,RHINOPRISTIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,RHINIDAE,Rhynchobatus,australiae,A2bd,"The Bottlenose Wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae) is a large (to ~300 cm total length) shark-like ray which is widespread in the Indo-West Pacific from Mozambique to the Solomon Islands and north to Taiwan. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 60 m. The taxonomy of the 'whitespotted wedgefish' species-complex (which includes several Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes) is not fully resolved, and the distribution of the Bottlenose Wedgefish may be refined when more information comes to light.&#160;Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity; the Bottlenose Wedgefish has litter sizes of 7-19 pups and an estimated generation length of 15 years.&#160;The ‚Äòwhite‚Äô fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes) are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Bottlenose Wedgefish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Bottlenose Wedgefish is inferred from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia. While some parts of Australasia provide refuge from intense fishing effort, this proportion of the species‚Äô range is not considered to be large enough relative to the global range to lower the assessment. It is inferred that the Bottlenose Wedgefish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Bottlenose Wedgefish occurs from close inshore to depths of at least 60 m on the continental shelf (Last et al. 2016). It occurs over soft substrates,&#160;but can also be associated with coral reefs. Maximum size is ~300 cm total length (TL); males mature at 110-130 cm TL; females mature at ~155 cm TL (White and Dharmadi 2007, Last and Stevens 2009, Last et al. 2016). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 7-19 pups (mean of 14); size at birth is&#160;46‚Äì50&#160;cm TL (White and Dharmadi 2007, Last and Stevens 2009).&#160;Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).","Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Bottlenose Wedgefish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;et al.&#160;2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).&#160;Fishing pressure is however considerably lower across northern Australia.In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017). In the Red Sea for example, the number of traditional boats tripled from 3,100 to 10,000 from 1988 to 2006 (Bruckner&#160;et al. 2011), and in the Indian state of Gujarat, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen&#160;et al.&#160;2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g. as reported in 2010: Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010), and most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g. Oman (19,000 artisanal boats), Pakistan (2,000 trawlers), Sri Lanka (24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004), and Indonesia (~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters) (Dissanayake 2005, CMFRI 2010, KKP 2016, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017).Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally&#160;and the targeting of wedgefishes for their fins has also been reported in numerous countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Mozambique, and Tanzania (Barrowclift&#160;et al.&#160;2017, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Bottlenose Wedgefish is landed throughout its range (e.g. White and Dharmadi 2007, Last&#160;et al.&#160;2010, Jabado 2018) and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Iran (Lack and Sant 2011). Wedgefishes have been targeted in Indonesia since the 1970s, and these target fisheries have shifted spatially in response to localized depletions (Chen 1996, White and Dharmadi 2007, White and Sommerville 2010, Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016, W.T. White, pers. comm. 2015).Fishing pressure is considerably lower across northern Australia and in Papua New Guinea, which provides some refuge for this species. The degree of connectivity with Indonesia and elsewhere is unknown, and if animals regularly move into Indonesian waters they would face significantly higher levels of fishing pressure there. There are no target fisheries for this species in Australia, but it is taken as bycatch in numerous non-target fisheries (e.g. Stobutzki et al. 2002, White et al. 2013). The introduction of Turtle Exclusion Devices in northern and eastern Australian prawn trawl fisheries is likely to have significantly reduced this species' mortality in trawl fishing gear (Brewer&#160;et al.&#160;2006).Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is known to occur in some parts of the range, for example by foreign and regional trawlers in Somalia and Yemen, with wedgefish specifically targeted off East Africa (IOTC 2005, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017). In northern Australia, wedgefish account for a minor component of the IUU fishing. The IUU activity peaked in the mid-2000s, and although vessel numbers have declined since then, there is still some illegal fishing in the region (Field&#160;et al.&#160;2009, Marshall 2011, Harward and Bergin 2016).The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;et al.&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore&#160;et al.&#160;2012, Jabado&#160;et al. 2017, Moore 2017). In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard&#160;et al.&#160;2010, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017), while Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro et al.&#160;2010).","Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;et al.&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;et al.&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., Rhynchobatus djiddensis) species-complex. The name&#160;Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that R. djiddensis is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last et al. 2016).Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g. the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;et al.&#160;2011, Watson&#160;et al.&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e., datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance.With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber&#160;et al.&#160;2009). It is worth noting that recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea recorded only a single individual Rhynchobatus&#160;(Tirtadanu et al. 2018), and in the North Natuna Sea (which is north of the Java Sea), trawl surveys recorded only two individuals (Yusup et al. 2018).Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g., 'whitespotted wedgefish', 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of wedgefishes and in each case probable species are listed. One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include wedgefishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish (Rhina ancylostoma), Bottlenose Wedgefish, Whitespotted Wedgefish (Rhynchobatus&#160;djiddensis), and Smoothnose Wedgefish (R. laevis). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 91% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bottlenose Wedgefish (45 years).Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country‚Äôs two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 98-99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bottlenose Wedgefish&#160;(45 years).&#160;&#160; Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-2004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of a 95% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bottlenose Wedgefish&#160;(45 years).&#160;&#160; Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj&#160;et al.&#160;2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Bowmouth Guitarfish and 'R. djiddensis', and hence would therefore include Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 86% over this period. Furthermore, species-specific trawl landings data were reported for 'R. djiddensis'&#160;(i.e. Bottlenose Wedgefish and Smoothnose Wedgefish), with a decline of 87% over this period. This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations. Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping likely includes Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, Clown Wedgefish (R. cooki), Eyebrow Wedgefish (R. palpebratus), and Broadnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bottlenose Wedgefish&#160;(45 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).&#160;&#160;The one region in which the Bottlenose Wedgefish may be in a better state than most of their range is Australia, where fishing effort is relatively low, Turtle Exclusion Devices reduce catches of large rays by 94% (Brewer et al. 2006), and there are controls on their catch and retention. Estimates of fishing mortality rates in the Northern Prawn Fishery (the main fishery to interact with this species) for this, and similar species, are well below those that would lead to significant population declines (Zhou and Griffiths 2008). Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and the above information can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Australia and Papua New Guinea provide some refuge for the species, however, this proportion of the species‚Äô range is not considered to be large enough relative to the global range to lower the assessment. Overall, it is inferred that the Bottlenose Wedgefish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.",Decreasing,"The Bottlenose Wedgefish is widespread in the Indo-West Pacific from Mozambique through the Western Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, Southeast Asia, and extending north to Taiwan, south to Australia (where it is wide-ranging across the north of the continent), and east to the Solomon Islands (Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016, Hylton et al. 2017). The species' distribution may not be fully defined due to confusion with other members of the Rhynchobatus djiddensis species-complex.","Wedgefishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins.&#160;The exception for this species is Australia where wedgefishes are generally not utilized or traded.&#160;While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally.&#160;The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g., Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). Large whole wedgefishes (&gt;200 cm total length; TL) have been traded for a high value of up to US$680 each, however, smaller specimens can sell for low value&#160;(e.g., Jabado 2018). The ‚Äòwhite‚Äô fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;Qun chi&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;et al.&#160;2018).&#160;The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;et al.&#160;2018). The eggs of shark-like rays&#160;are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque&#160;et al.&#160;2018, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data).",Marine," There are limited species-specific conservation or management measures in place for wedgefishes. Some localized protections, trawl bans, finning bans, as well as general fisheries management and marine protected areas likely benefit this species, although in some areas, effective enforcement is an ongoing issue. The Bottlenose Wedgefish was&#160;listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in 2017 which aims to provide a framework for the coordination of measures adopted by Range States to improve the conservation of the species.&#160;India has protected&#160;Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;since 2001 under Schedule 1 of the&#160;Wildlife (Protection) Act&#160;of 1972&#160;making its capture, landing, and trade illegal (Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017).&#160;The reclassification of wedgefishes (Last et al. 2016) indicated that R. djiddensis does not occur in India, but the species present there are&#160;R. australiae&#160;and&#160;R. laevis, which are currently not listed under the Act.&#160;The&#160;Bangladesh Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act, 2012&#160;protects&#160;Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;under Schedule I, but again, the species occurring in Bangladesh are&#160;R. australiae&#160;and&#160;R. laevis (Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016). Furthermore, the bans enacted under this legislation have not been implemented (Haque&#160;et al.&#160;2018).Kuwait bans the catches of all rays, and all sharks and rays are protected in Israel (although both countries represent a very small part of the species' range). Balochistan province in Pakistan protects all guitarfishes and wedgefishes and therefore this species is specifically protected in that province, while in Sindh province there are protections for juvenile guitarfishes and wedgefishes (less than 30 cm), including this species. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively),&#160;Malaysia has banned trawling in inshore waters, and other countries have seasonal trawl closures that may benefit the species. Finning (i.e. removing fins and discarding the body at sea) has been banned in several range states including the UAE, Oman, Iran, Israel, and Australia. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed. A Ministerial Decree issued by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) in 2019 imposes a permanent ban on fishing in UAE waters for shark species listed on CITES, and on CMS. In Australia, Queensland has a recreational possession limit of one shark or ray, and the Northern Territory a possession limit of three.In the major prawn trawl fisheries of northern and eastern Australia, the bycatch of large elasmobranchs has been significantly reduced since 2000 with the use of Turtle Exclusion Devices in trawl nets (e.g. Brewer&#160;et al.&#160;2006). In Queensland commercial net fisheries, there is a trip limit of five wedgefishes (DAFF 2009) and in the Northern Territory and Western Australia there are prohibitions on retention of any shark product in several non-target shark fisheries.Annex 1 of the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks (Sharks MOU) lists species that have an unfavourable conservation status and would significantly benefit from collaborative international conservation action. Currently (February 2019) 36 shark and ray species are included in Annex 1 of the Sharks MOU, including Rhynchobatus australiae, R. djiddensis, and R. laevis.To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring, including in artisanal fisheries, is needed to help understand population trends and inform management. Finally, taxonomy&#160;needs to be further resolved to improve certainty of species identification.",,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
37,North Africa,Glaucostegus cemiculus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,RHINOPRISTIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,GLAUCOSTEGIDAE,Glaucostegus,cemiculus,A2d,"The Blackchin Guitarfish (Glaucostegus cemiculus) is a medium-sized (to 265 cm total length) shark-like ray with a wide distribution in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the northern coast of Portugal to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 80 m. Giant guitarfishes have limited biological productivity; the Blackchin Guitarfish has an annual fecundity of 5-24 and an estimated generation length of 15 years.&#160;The ‚Äòwhite‚Äô fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade. Sharks and rays, including the Blackchin Guitarfish, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing. Large regional fishing nations including Mauritania and Senegal have seen significant increases in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in waters off West Africa. Severe population declines have been inferred for Indo-West Pacific giant guitarfishes from several datasets, and while similar data are not available for West Africa, the levels of documented population reduction (&gt;90% over the last three generation lengths for larger giant guitarfish species) could likely be considered representative of the situation in the eastern Atlantic. Indeed, specific target fisheries for the Blackchin Guitarfish have existed in several countries for many decades. Furthermore, the Blackchin Guitarfish was historically common throughout the northern Mediterranean Sea but has now disappeared from former areas of its range. It is inferred that the Blackchin Guitarfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Blackchin Guitarfish occurs from close inshore to depths of at least 80 m on the continental shelf (Last et al. 2016b). It occurs on sandy and muddy substrates. Maximum size is 265 cm total length (TL); size at maturity varies between the Eastern Atlantic (Senegal; males mature at 155 cm TL; females mature at 163 cm TL; Seck et al. 2004), and the Mediterranean (Tunisia; males mature at 100-112 cm TL; females mature at 110‚Äì138 cm TL;&#160;Capap√© and Zaouali 1994, Enajjar et al. 2012).&#160;Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 5-12 (Tunisia) and 16‚Äì24 (Senegal) pups with an annual reproductive cycle; size at birth is ~34 cm TL (Capap√© and Zaouali 1994,&#160;Seck&#160;et al.&#160;2004, Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016b). Age at maturity is 2.9 years in males and 5.1 years in females; maximum age is 14 years (198 cm TL female) (Enajjar&#160;et al.&#160;2012) but is likely higher given the species reaches a larger maximum size. Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).","Globally, giant guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Giant guitarfishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure in West Africa with a long history of artisanal and industrial fishing. As a result, demersal coastal fisheries resources are considered overexploited in significant areas of the region (e.g., FAO 2018b). In the Mediterranean, the Blackchin Guitarfish is regularly landed in fisheries both as a target species and as bycatch, particularly in the southern and eastern Mediterranean (see Lteif 2015, Newell 2016).Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Diop and Dossa 2011); the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). Unreported finning of sharks and 'guitar sharks' occurs in the Mauritania industrial shrimp fishery (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006), and no doubt occurs more widely. Sharks and rays, including giant guitarfishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and significant declines of Blackchin Guitarfish (Tous&#160;et al.&#160;1998, Diop and Dossa 2011). Several countries across the West African range of the Blackchin Guitarfish are significant fishing nations with high levels of fishing pressure on the marine environment (including Mauritania, Senegal, C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, and Ghana). Mauritania has seen a significant increase in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century: in 1950 there were 125 pirogues (small fishing boats), in the 1980s there were &lt;750, in the late 1990s there were &gt;2,500, and in 2005 there was nearly 4,000 (Belhabib&#160;et al.&#160;2012). Furthermore, the industrial fleet is significant with 172 vessels (mostly trawlers) licensed to fish in its Exclusive Economic Zone in 2015 (ONS 2017). Similarly, the number of artisanal pirogues in Senegal rose from ~5,000 in 1982 to &gt;9,000 in 2003 and 12,699 in 2006, although it has since fallen slightly to 11,889 in 2013 (FAO 2008, ANSD 2016). The industrial fleet operating in Senegalese waters included 91 trawlers in 2013 (ANSD 2016). Within parts of West Africa, the Blackchin Guitarfish was a dominant component of the batoid landings in artisanal fisheries including in Sierra Leone (e.g. Seisay 2005), and in Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau where it was a target species (Diop and Dossa 2011). This included heavy targeting of the species within the Banc d'Arguin National Park, Mauritania prior to the implementation of a ban on directly targeted elasmobranch fishing from December 2003 (Diop and Dossa 2011). However, artisanal and illegal fishing effort is significant and ongoing in the park (Belhabib&#160;et al.&#160;2012).","Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g. Tous&#160;et al.&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;et al.&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for giant guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction primarily due to a lack of species-specific reporting.The Blackchin Guitarfish was regarded as historically common within both the northern (Doderlein 1884, de Buen 1935) and southern (Quignard and Capap√© 1971, Whitehead&#160;et al. 1984,&#160;Brada√Ø&#160;et al. 2006) Mediterranean Sea. However, there are now contrasting situations between these two areas. The Blackchin Guitarfish has largely disappeared from the northern Mediterranean and it was not recorded in extensive trawl surveys under the Mediterranean International Trawl Surveys (MEDITS) program from 1994 to 2015 (Relini and Piccinetti 1991, Newell 2016) or in trawl surveys in the Adriatic Sea between 1948 and 2005 (Ferretti&#160;et al.&#160;2013). In the southern Mediterranean (including the Gulf of Gab√©s, and areas of the eastern Mediterranean which seem to be a core parts of the species' distribution), the species is still present and in some areas still commonly caught (e.g., Echwikhi&#160;et al.&#160;2014,&#160;Soldo&#160;et al. 2014,&#160;Lteif 2015, Newell 2016).&#160;In the Banc D'Arguin National Park in Mauritania, 95% of Blackchin Guitarfish caught are smaller than their size-at-maturity and an analysis of the change in the average size of landed individuals from 1998 to 2007 highlights a significant size decrease (Diop and Dossa 2011). No species-specific trend data are available, but this size reduction, and the high levels of exploitation across West Africa suggest a population reduction, which can also be inferred from looking at data available from outside the Atlantic Ocean on population reduction in wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes.In the Indo-West Pacific (outside of the range of the Blackchin Guitarfish), there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates (non species-specific) which can be used to infer population reduction, and these can be considered informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly where they are under heavy exploitation (see the Supplementary Information). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally (Anticamara&#160;et al.&#160;2011, Watson&#160;et al.&#160;2013).These historical accounts and datasets from the Indo-West Pacific show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979); (2) the collapse of Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002); (3) the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes) in in the Java Sea (Blaber&#160;et al.&#160;2009)&#160;(recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea and North Natuna Sea recorded only three&#160;Rhynchobatus; Tirtadanu&#160;et al.&#160;2018, Yusup&#160;et al.&#160;2018); (4) declines in landings from Iran, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are the equivalent of 81-99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30-45 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018a, M. Gore unpubl. data) (see the Supplementary Information); and, (5) significant declines in landings of 'guitarfishes' (which includes wedgefishes) in Tamil Nadu (86% decline for a 5-year period) and catch rates of rays (which does not include wedgefishes, but is representative of declines in demersal batoids) in Maharashtra (63% decline for a 15-year period) in India (Mohanraj&#160;et al.&#160;2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009) (see the Supplementary Information). Fishing pressure (‚Äòactual levels of exploitation‚Äô) is high and increasing across the West African range of the Blackchin Guitarfish and there has been a long history of fisheries exploitation in the Mediterranean part of its range which is ongoing (see the Threats section). There is nothing to suspect that similar declines as outlined above for the Indo-West Pacific have not occurred in West Africa. This species is not likely to have any serious refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the high value of its fins.It is inferred that the Blackchin Guitarfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and it is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.",Decreasing,"The Blackchin Guitarfish is widely distributed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the northern coast of Portugal to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea (where it appears to be more prevalent in the southern and eastern regions) (Capap√© 1989, Last et al. 2016b).","Giant guitarfishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins. While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally. The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). The ‚Äòwhite‚Äô fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;Qun chi&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;et al.&#160;2018).&#160;The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;et al.&#160;2018). The eggs of shark-like rays are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque&#160;et al.&#160;2018, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data), and the snout of giant guitarfishes are considered a delicacy in Singapore where they are steamed and the gelatinous filling consumed.",Marine,"  The Blackchin Guitarfish is subjected to some species-specific management measures in its European range. In particular, it is listed on Annex II of the Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity Protocol for the Mediterranean under the Barcelona Convention, and it cannot be retained on board, trans-shipped, landed, transferred, stored, sold, displayed or offered for sale, and must be released unharmed and alive, to the extent possible, pursuant to Recommendation GFCM/36/2012/1. European Union (EU) vessels are prohibited from fishing for guitarfishes in EU waters of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) sub-areas I (Barents Sea), II (Norwegian Sea, Spitsbergen and Bear Island), III (Skagerrak, Kattegat, Sound, Belt Sea, and Baltic Sea), IV (North Sea), V (Iceland and Faroe Islands), VI (Rockall, northwest coast of Scotland and North Ireland), VII (Irish Sea, West of Ireland, Porcupine Bank, English Channel, Bristol Channel, Celtic Sea, and Southwest of Ireland), VIII (Bay of Biscay), IX (Portuguese waters), X (Azores grounds) and XII (north of the Azores), but not in the Mediterranean Sea. Note that the Blackchin Guitarfish does not occur in many of these areas. In 2013, the European Union (EU) banned the removal of shark fins on board vessels (CEC 2013) in order to enhance enforcement of the 2003 EU ban on shark finning (CEC 2003) and facilitate improved shark fishery data collection. All sharks and rays, including this species, are protected in Israel.While there are no species-specific conservation or management measures in place for this species in West Africa, there is a ban on directly targeted elasmobranch fishing in the Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania, which was implemented in December 2003 (Diop and Dossa 2011). The Blackchin Guitarfish occurs in the&#160;Banc d'Arguin National Park, where only traditional Indigenous fishers are permitted to fish (however, artisanal and illegal fishing effort is significant in the park;&#160;Belhabib&#160;et al.&#160;2012). Furthermore,&#160;shark fishing is prohibited in some small sub-regional marine protected areas, but overall, these areas represent only a small portion of the species' range. Finning bans (i.e. removing fins and discarding the body at sea) were introduced in territorial waters of some range states during the 2000s. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed, and&#160;unreported finning of sharks and 'guitar sharks' occurs in the Mauritania industrial shrimp fishery (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006).To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring, including in artisanal fisheries, is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.",,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
38,North Africa,Squatina aculeata,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,SQUATINIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,SQUATINIDAE,Squatina,aculeata,A2bcd+3cd,"The Sawback Angelshark (Squatina aculeata) is a medium-sized demersal shark (to 175 cm total length) that formerly was a common and important predator over large areas of its coastal shelf and continental slope (30 to 500 m depth) habitat in the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic. Most of this region is now subject to intense demersal fisheries, and the species is highly susceptible at all life stages to bycatch in demersal trawls, set nets, dredges, and bottom longlines operating through most of its range and habitat. Industrial and artisanal fishing pressure is intense and often unregulated in this region and it is suspected that this will continue at the current level or increase in the future. As a result of its limiting life history characteristics and bycatch in fisheries with steadily increasing effort and capacity, its abundance has declined dramatically during the past 50 years. It is now extremely uncommon throughout most of its range, and many records of angel sharks are only reported to genus level. Along the West African coast this species is taken as occasional bycatch of industrial trawl and artisanal gillnet fisheries and was reported as common in Russian-led surveys during the 1970s and 1980s. Portuguese landings data from the fleet operating off Morocco and Mauritania, aggregated for the three native angel shark species combined indicates a 95% decline in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from 1990 to 1998. The available data from this region indicate that there are very few recent records. It is suspected that the species has undergone overall declines of at least 80% across its range over the past three generation lengths (~45 years), and bycatch is likely to continue. Therefore, this species is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd+3cd.","The Sawback Angelshark is a coastal and shelf species that inhabits the uppermost slopes of the warm-temperate and tropical Eastern Atlantic. It lives on or near the seabed at depths of 30 to 500 m over soft substrates. The observed length of this shark at maturity is 120-122 cm total length (TL) for males and 137-143 cm TL for females. The maximum sizes reported by Capap√© et al. (2005) were 152 cm and 175 cm TL for males and females, respectively, although maximum sizes are estimated at around 188 cm TL (Compagno et al. 2005). The Sawback Angelshark is a lecithotrophic viviparous species, with two functional ovaries and uteri. Its gestation time was estimated at 1 year by Capap√© et al. (2005), with parturition probably occurring between May and July and with a reproductive periodicity of 2 years. The size at birth was estimated at 30-35 cm TL with litter sizes of 8-12 pups.The species' generation length is estimated at ~15 years, based on data for its relative the Pacific Angelshark (Squatina californica) (Cailliett et al. 1992).&#160; ","Angel sharks are highly susceptible to bycatch in trawls and dredges, as they lie on the seabed covered in substrate waiting to ambush prey. Demersal trawl effort has increased in both intensity and efficiency on the shelf and slope area in the Mediterranean over the last 60 years. The species is also bycaught in trammel nets and bottom-set longlines throughout its range. Human disturbance by habitat degradation and tourism are also possible threats to its preferred soft-bottom nearshore habitat. Angel sharks are prone to local depletion due to their fragmented habitat, which could lead to low rate of exchange between populations, therefore limiting the recovery potential of these isolated populations. If adjacent populations are depleted, the possibility of recruitment is further reduced. Along the West African coasts, there are no directed fisheries for this species but it is taken as bycatch of major international industrial demersal trawl fisheries and inshore bottom set gillnets."," There are no population estimates for this species across its range. Sightings and catches are now rare throughout this species' range, and it is thought that depletion has occurred as a result of historical and ongoing overfishing.Species-level Population Data:During the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS) Program (1995-1999), a broad scale survey of the north Mediterranean coastline, spanning from West Morocco to the Aegean Sea in depths of 10 to 800 m, the species appeared in only one of a total of 9,095 tows (Baino et al. 2001). Ragonese et al. (2013) reported a single capture close to the Gulf of Gab√®s in 2000 during a GRUND survey covering the area between Sicily, Malta, and Tunisia, at the time the species was confirmed in Libya although as rare. Brada√Ø et al. (2006) assessed the Sawback Angelshark as regularly observed in the Gulf of Gab√®s (Tunisia), according to Capap√© et al. (2005) who reported the capture of 27 specimens between 1970 and 2002. The species was reported again in Sicily in 2010 (MEDLEM). Hemida (pers. comm. in Capap√© et al. 2005) never recorded the species in Algeria between 1996-2005 despite high sampling effort, yet Capape (2005) did encounter this species in Tunisia.In contrast, there have been sporadic occurrences in the eastern Mediterranean in the Aegean Sea and the Levantine basin during the last 20 years. Damalas and Vassilopoulou (2011) recorded three individuals in the 1995-2000 period in the Central Aegean Sea (whereas none were captured between 2003 and 2006) from 335 bottom trawl hauls. √únal et al. (2010) also reported its occurrence in the Dardanelles Strait in 2007. Corsini and Zava (2007) reported two captures in 2004 and 2006 in the southern range of the Aegean Sea, and another one was provided by Filiz et al. (2005) from the coasts of Turkey. Off Turkish waters in the Levantine Basin, individual records occurred in 1997, 2013, 2014, and 2015 were reported by Ba≈üusta (2002), MEDLEM, Erguden and Bayhan (2015) and Ba≈üusta (2016), respectively. Furthermore, Saad et al. (2006) stated that Sawback Angelsharks were captured during scientific surveys off Syria between 2001 and 2004. Finally, Golani (2006) assessed it as a rare species off the Mediterranean coasts of Israel, and Hadjichristophorou (2006) did not include it in the Cyprus checklist of fishes.There are little species-specific data from the West African coasts, however, this species was previously reported as common in Russian-led surveys in this region during the 1970s and 1980s (F. Litvinov pers. comm. 2006). Capap√© et al. (2005) stated that Sawback Angelsharks were relatively abundant in the eastern tropical Atlantic, especially off the coast of Senegal.Genus-level Population Data:In addition to species-specific data, there are a number of datasets which include aggregated angel shark (Squatina spp.) landings/records, due to the difficulty of identifying to species level and lack of impetus to record to species level. These records could indicate the potential presence of the Sawback Angelshark. For example, off the Balearic Islands Squatina spp. were historically documented in checklists (Barcel√≥ and Combis 1868, Fage 1907). Captures of angel sharks were relatively frequent until the 1970s, becoming increasingly sporadic during the 1980s in coastal artisanal fisheries (trammel nets and gillnets), trawls and bottom longline fisheries. For example, records from a Balearic lobster gillnet fishery show that it was common to capture angel sharks on a daily basis until the mid 1980s. But since the mid 1990s no reports of any angel shark species have been reported in the area (G. Morey unpubl. data 2019). Massut√≠ and Moranta (2003) reported no captures of angel sharks from four bottom trawl fishing surveys (131 hauls, at a depth range of 46-1,800 m) carried out between 1996 and 2001 around the Balearic Islands. In addition, the likely low interaction with stocks from other areas further affects the already low recovery capacity of isolated populations such as those around the Balearics.In the western Mediterranean, Vacchi et al. (2002) reported a dramatic decline of angel sharks in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea in the period 1898-1922. Furthermore, fisheries statistics indicate that 180 tonnes of angel sharks were reported landed in Tunisia in 2015, an increase on 125 tonnes in 2014, however nothing is known of the effort associated with these landings (FAO FishStat 2015).In the West African coasts, artisanal Senegalese fishermen remember angel sharks as common and frequently caught by lines and gillnet 30 years ago; however they appear to have been strongly depleted to the point where they have almost disappeared, now occurring very rarely (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 2006). Catches are now very rare according to both artisanal fishermen and observers of the industrial demersal trawl fleets (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 2006).Portuguese landings data from a fleet operating off Morocco and Mauritania (aggregated for Sawback Angelshark, Smoothback Angelshark Squatina oculata, and Angelshark Squatina squatina) indicate a significant decline between 1990 and 1998 (ICES 2013). Landings peaked at 35 tonnes (t) in 1990 and the fishery was closed in 1998 when the total landings had dropped to 1.7 t. This represents a 95% decline in landings in eight years, however nothing is known of the pattern of effort associated with these landings.Overall, given the lack of occurrences in artisanal and commercial fishery surveys, and the ongoing fishing pressure within this species range, a population decline of at least 80% is suspected over the last three generations (45 years).",Decreasing,"The Sawback Angelshark occurs along the southern Mediterranean coast from Algeria to the eastern basin, and along the northern coast from Turkey possibly to Albania. It is confirmed as extant in Tunisia, Sicily, Israel, northern Cyprus, Turkey, the Aegean Islands, and eastern mainland Greece. Its presence is uncertain in Algeria, Sardinia, Malta, Libya, Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, southern Cyprus, Crete, western mainland Greece, and Albania (E. Meyers unpubl. data 2019). In the Eastern Atlantic, it is extant in Senegal, The Gambia, and Sierra Leone. Its presence is uncertain in Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and Liberia (E. Meyers unpubl. data 2019). ",This species is caught and retained as bycatch. It is likely utilized for meat in West Africa and possibly elsewhere.,Marine," The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean has adopted a measure (GFCM/36/2012/3) to prohibit retention, transshipment, landings, storage, display, and sale of 24 species, including the three native Mediterranean angel shark species listed on the Barcelona Convention‚Äôs Annex II of the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean. Regulation ((EU) 2015/2102) Article 16j further reinforces the GFCM measure for EU vessels prohibiting retention, landings and sale, and requiring live release where possible. Greater implementation would improve the effectiveness of all measures previously listed. Within eight Balearic Island marine reserves, fishing for these species is forbidden and accidental captures must be released. All three native angel sharks have been protected within Spanish Mediterranean waters since 2012 through the Spanish List of Species Under Special Protection (LESPRE) Orden AAA/75/2012. In Maltese waters angel sharks have been protected since 2013. Furthermore, Israel listed all shark species under domestic regulations (Ariel and Barash 2015), although enforcement is low. In April 2018 through Communique 2018/19, the Turkish Government announced updates to Article 5 of the Turkish Prohibited Species lists (Communique 2016/35), with the addition of 14 elasmobranch species, which includes the three species of angel shark found in the Mediterranean. This species is included in the attached Supplementary Information: 'Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Angel Shark Conservation Strategy' (Gordon et al. 2017). The goals of the strategy are to: i) minimize fishery mortality; ii) identify and protect areas critical to angel shark survival, reproduction, and recovery; and, iii) identify human interactions and minimize the negative impacts. Policy priorities from the strategy include (but are not limited to) listing the species on Spanish domestic fishery regulations (in process), implementing GFCM measures, including listing of the species in EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), and possibly listing on the Convention of Migratory Species pending data confirming migratory behavior (Gordon et al. 2017).The Angel Shark Conservation Network was created with the aim to facilitate collaborations and collect information about angel sharks throughout their range (www.angelsharknetwork.com). For this purpose, an interactive map (www.angelsharknetwork.com/#map) was created to register sightings of all of the native angel sharks.

39,North Africa,Squatina oculata,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,SQUATINIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,SQUATINIDAE,Squatina,oculata,A2bcd+3cd,"The Smoothback Angelshark (Squatina oculata) is a medium-sized (to 160 cm total length) demersal shark. Formerly the species was a common ambush predator over large areas of its coastal and outer continental shelf soft sediment habitat at depths of 10 to 500 m in the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic. Most of this region has, and continues, to be subject to intense demersal fisheries, and the species is highly catchable from birth as retained bycatch in demersal trawls, set nets, bottom longlines, and dredges. As a result of its limiting life history characteristics (slow growth and late maturation) and fisheries that have steadily increased in effort and capacity, its abundance has declined dramatically during the past 50 years to the point where it is now apparently locally extinct in parts of the northern Mediterranean and West African coasts. It is now extremely uncommon throughout most of the remainder of its range and is thus inferred to have undergone a decline in area of occupancy. Along the West African coasts this species is caught and retained as bycatch in industrial trawl and artisanal gillnet fisheries, and was reported as common in Russian surveys during the 1970s and 1980s. Portuguese landings data from the fleet operating off Morocco and Mauritania, aggregated for Smoothback and Sawback Angelsharks, indicates a 95% decline in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from 1990-1998. Industrial and artisanal fishing pressure is intense and often unregulated in this region; it is suspected that this will continue at the current level or increase in the future leading to further declines due to bycatch. Overall declines of 80% or more are suspected over the past three generation lengths (~45 years) for this species based on a lack of presence in landings despite increasing effort, which is expected to continue into the future. Therefore the Smoothback Angelshark is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd+3cd. ","The Smoothback Angelshark is a warm-temperate and tropical demersal species that inhabits sandy-muddy habitat on continental shelves and upper slopes from 10 to 500 m (mostly between 50 and 100 m and deeper in the tropics than in temperate seas).Capap√© et al. (1990) reported the occurrence of Smoothback Angelsharks at a depth range 50-200 m (and probably down to 300 m) in Tunisian waters, except for gravid females and young-of-the-year, suggesting that shallow waters in the Gulf of Tunis may act as a parturition and nursery area. Surveys off the West African coast indicate that the species may form aggregations in December (Litvinov 1993). Age at maturity, longevity, and reproductive age are all unknown. Females are reported to mature at 100 cm total length (TL) from Tunisian waters (Capap√© et al. 1990) and 89 cm TL from Senegal (Capap√© et al. 2002), males at 71 cm TL from Tunisia (Capap√© et al. 1990) and 82 cm TL from Senegal (Capap√© et al. 2002). They reach a maximum size of 160 cm TL in females (Compagno et al. 2005) and 145 cm TL in males (Ebert et al. 2013).This species is lecithotrophic viviparous, with both ovaries functional. A study from Senegal indicated that they give birth from February-April (after a maximum one year gestation period) to 3 to 8 young (Capap√© et al. 2002), ranging from 22.5-27 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Capap√© et al. 2002). The reproductive periodicity is biannual. The rate of population increase and natural mortality are all unknown.The species' generation length is estimated at ~15 years, based on data for its relative the Pacific Angelshark (Squatina californica) (Cailliett et al. 1992).&#160; ","Angel sharks are highly susceptible to bycatch in trawls as they are ambush predators that lie on the bottom. Demersal trawl effort has increased in both intensity and efficiency on the shelf and slope area within this species' range over the last 50 years. These species are also bycaught in trammel nets, bottom longlines, and dredges throughout their range. Human disturbance by habitat degradation and tourism are also possible threats to preferred sandy habitat.Along the West African coasts, there are no directed fisheries for this species but it is caught and retained as bycatch of major international industrial demersal trawl fisheries and inshore bottom set gillnets. Aggregated fisheries catch landings data mask species-specific reports, hindering the ability to establish the true threat level.","To date there have been no dedicated population estimates for the Smoothback Angelshark.Although historically this species occurred throughout the west coast of Africa and the Mediterranean Sea, it has undergone severe declines in the northwestern Mediterranean since the mid-1980s (Sartor et al. 2010, Maynou et al. 2011) as well as in the Adriatic Sea (Soldo 2013). Records since 1997 in the central Mediterranean (Ragonese et al. 2013, Zava et al. 2016), the northeast coast of Sicily (Zava et al. 2016), Aegean Sea (Machias et al. 2001, Corsini and Zava 2007), Sea of Marmara (Kabaskal and Kabaskal 2014), in the Levantine basin (Machias et al. 2001, Corsini and Zava 2007, Damalas and Vassilopoulou 2011), Tunisia (FAO 2015), Ghana (FAO), Senegal (Capape et al. 2002), and Sierra Leone (E. Meyers unpubl. data 2017) confirm the continued occurrence of the species in those areas. Species-specific Data: In the western Mediterranean, Capap√© et al. (2002) stated that the Smoothback Angelshark is unknown off the French coast. Relini et al. (2000) did not report captures of Smoothback Angelshark in any of 9,281 hauls during 22 trawl surveys from 1985-1998 as part of the Italian National Project. Data from the MEDITS program, a broad scale survey of the north Mediterranean coastline, spanning from west Morocco to the Aegean Sea in depths of 10-800 m, showed that this species did not appear in any of a total of 9,095 tows performed between 1995 and 1999 (Baino et al. 2001). Arapi et al. (2006) reported the capture of nearly four tonnes of this species in Albania in 2004, which accounted for 12.5% of the total elasmobranch biomass landed. However in contrast, Soldo (2013) noted the absence of records of the species in the Adriatic during the last 10-30 years (even if it was cited as there by Soldo 2006) and the species was absent in a total of 2,575 bottom trawl tows carried out between 1948 and 2005 across the Adriatic Sea (Ferretti et al. 2013). This species was, however, recently confirmed to still be extant in Croatia (Holcer and Lazar 2017). In the central Mediterranean, Ragonese et al. (2013) reported the capture of three Smoothback Angelsharks in 1997, 1998, and 2006 from 2,311 hauls conducted between Sicily, Malta, and Tunisia in the 1994-2009 period. Zava et al. (2016) reported the capture of four juvenile specimens in a single bottom trawl haul conducted south of Sicily in 2007, indicating that the species is still able to reproduce in some areas of Mediterranean Sea.In the eastern Mediterranean, the Smoothback Angelshark was included in the checklist of fishes occurring in Israel as a prevalent species (Golani 2006). Saad et al. (2006) also reported it from scientific surveys conducted off Syria between 2001 and 2004, and stated it as ‚Äúmoderately economically important‚Äù, however there have been no confirmed records in Israel or Syria since. A Smoothback Angelshark specimen was caught 6 km from shore in a small longliner operating from Gemikonaga, North Cyprus, in May 2013 (Bater, R. unpubl. data). Machias et al. (2001) found the occurrence of this species in the bottom trawl discards in the eastern Ionian and Aegean seas, although they did not provide more detailed information. The species appears to still be present in the central Aegean Sea, but it is likely rare as Damalas and Vassilopoulou (2011) recorded only one individual to be present in 335 bottom trawl hauls conducted between 1995 and 2006. Bile√ßenoglu et al. (2014) recorded this species as occurring in the Sea of Marmara, Aegean Sea and Levantine Sea. The two more recent records of the species came both from the southeastern Aegean Sea: Rhodes island (Corsini and Zava 2007) and Akyaka (Turkey; J. Barker, pers. comm. cited in Miller 2015).This species is also present off the North Africa coastline, for example, as reported for the Tunisian Gulf of Gab√®s coast (Quignard and Othman 1978). Capap√© et al. (1990) recorded 108 specimens and 60 young-of-the-year in Tunisian waters (period not specified), suggesting the shallow waters of the Gulf of Tunis could be a parturition and nursery area. Brada√Ø et al. (2006) considered Smoothback Angelsharks to be regularly observed in the Gulf of Gab√®s, and the species was confirmed off the Libyan coast (Lamboeuf et al. 1995). As stated by Miller (2015), UNEP (UNEP-MAP RAC/SPA 2005) reported the species as being relatively common in Libyan waters but provided no corresponding citation or data to support this statement. Data for Egyptian waters could not be found.There are little species-specific data from the West African coasts, although Fager and Longhurst (1968) recorded its presence in the Gulf of Guinea. This species was previously reported as common in Russian surveys in this region during the 1970s and 1980s (F. Litvinov pers. comm. 2006). Capap√© et al. (2002) reported both Smoothback Angelshark and Sawback Angelshark (Squatina aculeata) as regularly captured off the coast of Senegal, generally by demersal gill nets and by anglers, in the shallow coastal waters at a maximum depth of 80 m over sandy-muddy bottoms. As stated in Miller (2015), Hureau and Monod (1973) also referred to the species as ‚Äúrather common‚Äù in the Eastern Atlantic from Morocco to Angola. During 1981-1982, a Norwegian research vessel conducted trawl surveys off West Africa from Aghadir to Ghana, where Smoothback Angelshark was the only Squatina species caught, with catch rates of 45.6 kg/hour off the coast of The Gambia, 13.4 kg/hour off Sierra Leone, and 12.4 kg/hour off Liberia (Str√∏mme 1984). In 2001, Smoothback Angelsharks were reported as occurring off the coast of Ghana, but individuals were rarely landed (Edwards et al. 2001). Based on the information from the SIAP databases, the species was recorded rather sporadically in the surveys (dating 1962-2002), with a few years with reports of more than 20 individuals, primarily from surveys conducted off Senegal (Miller 2015). In Sierra Leone, Squatina species were periodically caught by demersal trawlers in the 1980s, but were caught very infrequently in the 1990s and early 2000s (M. Seisay pers comm. 2006). 62 individuals have been caught in the research surveys held in the FIAS database, with additional reports of 40 landings between 2008 and 2011 (E. Meyers unpubl. data 2017). It is suspected that most of these records are of juveniles, based on the weight of the captures. Only five individuals were caught in Guinea between 1986 and 2002 and none were caught in Mauritania. Another record from Guinea was confirmed in 2017 (E. Meyers unpubl. data 2017). In Senegal a total of 51 individuals weighing 56 kg were caught from 1971 to 2000 and none have been recorded in recent surveys. In The Gambia six individuals weighing 6 kg were caught from 1986 to 2000, and none have been caught since (FIAS unpub. data).Generic Angel Shark Data (Squatina spp.):Maynou et al. (2011) concluded that in the Catalan Sea the genus Squatina became practically extinct probably before 1959. The species is likely to have been extirpated from the Balearic Islands, where captures of Squatina spp. were relatively frequent in artisanal fisheries, bottom trawls and bottom longlines until the 1970s, after which captures became sporadic. Vacchi et al. (2002) reported the dramatic decline in the elasmobranch catch of a tuna trap operating in Baratti (Northern Tyrrhenian Sea) between 1898 and 1922. For the genus Squatina, catches decreased from an average of 134 specimens from the period 1898 to 1905, to 95 between 1906 and 1913, and down to 15 between 1914 and 1922. This early decline probably marks the beginning of trawling activity. Furthermore, Ferretti et al. (2005) noted the disappearance of the Squatina genus from the northern Tyrrhenian Sea in the early 1970s, although Sartor et al. (2010) and Maynou et al. (2011) reported the last catches of Squatina spp. to be made between the late 1970s and early 1980s from off the Italian mainland, whereas their disappearance in Sardinian waters was dated in the mid 1980s.In the central Mediterranean, fisheries statistics for Tunisia indicate that 180 tonnes of Squatina spp. were reported landed in 2015, an increase on 125 tonnes in 2014 (FAO FishStat 2015). However, nothing is known of the effort associated with these landings.In the eastern Atlantic, data from Southern Portugal also suggest the scarcity of the species in the area, where no specimen of the genus Squatina was recorded from experimental fishery surveys using semi-pelagic longlines and trammel nets (Coelho et al. 2005). Nevertheless, the genus&#160;is reported in Portuguese fishery statistics, showing a clear decline in the last 20 years (R. Coelho pers. comm. 2006).In West Africa, all landings data (as reported to FAO) are aggregated for all angel sharks. Artisanal Senegalese fishermen remember angel sharks as common and frequently caught by lines and gillnet 30 years ago; however they seem to have been depleted to the point where they have almost disappeared, now occurring very rarely (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 2006). Catches are now very rare according to both artisanal fishermen and observers of the industrial demersal trawl fleets (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 2006).Overall the Smoothback Angelshark is suspected to have undergone declines of at least 80% over the past three generations (45 years).  ",Decreasing," Historically, the Smoothback Angelshark occurred in the Mediterranean from France and Tunisia to the eastern basin and the Sea of Marmara. In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, this species occurred from Mauritania to Senegal. The species has not been reported from many areas in the region over the past several decades, and may now be absent from some areas that have been subject to heavy fishing pressure.","The species is retained for consumption of meat and liver oil. Off the coasts of Senegal it was frequently landed throughout the year and their fins were specially collected and prepared under the vernacular native name of ‚Äúla√¢f‚Äù and exported (Capap√©&#160;et al. 2002). At Ouakam, Senegal, the livers were removed from a great number of specimens with their oil extracted using traditional methods and used to protect fermented dried fishes from infestation by Dermestes spp. and other insect damage. This referred to adult specimens, the smallest ones being generally rejected by fishermen and thus not landed.",Marine,"  The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean has adopted a measure (GFCM/36/2012/3) to prohibit retention, landings, transhipment, storage, display, and sale of 24 species including the three native Mediterranean Squatina species listed on the Barcelona Convention‚Äôs Annex II of the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean. Regulation ((EU) 2015/2102) Article 16j further reinforces the GFCM measure for EU vessels prohibiting retention, landings and sale, and requiring live release where possible. Greater implementation would improve the effectiveness of all measures previously listed.All three native angel sharks have been protected within Spanish waters in the Mediterranean since 2012 through the Spanish List of Species Under Special Protection (LESPRE) Orden AAA/75/2012. All three species of Mediterranean angel sharks have been protected within Maltese waters since 2013, when they were included in Environment and Development Planning Act (Cap. 504) under Schedule VI ‚ÄúAnimal and plant species of national interest in need of strict protection‚Äù. Furthermore, Israel listed all shark species under domestic regulations (Ariel and Barash 2015), although enforcement is insufficient. In April 2018 through Communique 2018/19, the Turkish Government announced updates to Article 5 of the Turkish Prohibited Species lists (Communique 2016/35), with the addition of 14 elasmobranch species including all three species of angel shark found in the Mediterranean.This species is included in the attached Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Angel Shark Conservation Strategy (Gordon et al. 2017). The goals of the strategy are to: (i) minimize fishery mortality; (ii) identify and protect areas critical to angel shark survival, reproduction, and recovery; and, (iii) identify human interactions and minimize the negative impacts. Policy priorities from the Strategy include (but are not limited to) listing the species on Spanish domestic fishery regulations (in process), implementing GFCM measures, including this species in EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), and possibly listing on the Convention of Migratory Species pending data confirming migratory behaviour (Gordon et al. 2017).The Angel Shark Conservation Network was created with the aim to facilitate collaborations and collect information about angel sharks throughout their range (www.angelsharknetwork.com). For this purpose, an interactive map (www.angelsharknetwork.com/#map) was created to register sightings. ",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
40,North Africa,Squatina squatina,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,SQUATINIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,SQUATINIDAE,Squatina,squatina,A2bcd,"The Angelshark (Squatina squatina) is a large (to 244 cm total length) demersal shark that formerly was a common predator at depths down to 150 m over large areas of its coastal shelf sandy habitat in the Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Black Seas. Most of this region is now subject to intense demersal fisheries; from birth the species is highly susceptible to bycatch in demersal trawls, set nets, dredges, and bottom longlines, which operate through most of its range and habitat. It is also caught in recreational fisheries, through shore and boat angling, as well as spearfishing. Habitat loss in some areas as a result of coastal commercial and tourism development is also likely to have affected this species. Heavy exploitation combined with limiting life history traits, such as low productivity, have led to dramatic declines during the past 50 years. The species is now extremely uncommon throughout most of its range, with the exception of the Canary Islands, which have been identified as a unique stronghold for the species where individuals are sighted regularly by divers and fishers. In other areas of its range, occasional sightings are reported, specifically along the coast of Wales (Cardigan Bay) and the West Coast of Ireland, the Tyrrhenian Sea, North Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, and Mediterranean coasts of Turkey, Algeria, and Egypt. Its status should be confirmed in these areas and existing and new conservation measures should be implemented and/or introduced as a matter of urgency. It is inferred that this species has undergone a decline in area of occupancy (AOO). Comparisons of indices of abundance and biomass in various parts of its range of occurrence over extended periods dating back to the early 20th century show declines &gt;90% with no evidence of recovery. Based on these inferred historical declines, a suspected decline in extent of occurrence (EOO) and AOO, and the contemporary rarity of the species, it is suspected that declines of at least 80% (but likely closer to 90%) have occurred over the past three generations (~45 years). Therefore, the Angelshark is listed as Critically Endangered A2bcd. ","The Angelshark is a temperate bottom-dwelling shark of the continental shelves of Europe and the Mediterranean basin, occurring on or near the bottom from close inshore in the shallow sublittoral (&lt;1 m depth) to at least 150 m depth. It may occasionally penetrate estuaries and brackish water.This shark prefers sandy bottoms, where it lies buried with little more than its eyes protruding in waiting for prey. The Angelshark is nocturnal and can be found swimming strongly off the bottom at night, but it rests on the bottom in daytime. It is likely to make seasonal inshore migrations that coincide with changes in water temperature or during the mating season (Meyers et al. 2017). In the northern parts of its range, the Angelshark was often reported seasonally, suggesting possible northward and/or inshore movements during the summer (Compagno et al. 2005). Tagging experiments performed in Tunisian waters showed that Angelsharks&#160;are not prone to large movements in the area (Quignard and Capap√© 1971, Capap√© et al. 1990), with a range of 10-44 km away from the tagging site after a range of 12-231 days. Mark‚Äìrecapture data for Angelsharks tagged in Ireland have shown that a high proportion of fish are recaptured from the original release location, although occasionally individuals can undertake longer-distance movements of up to 1,160 km (Quigley 2006). Nearly 96% (179) of the recaptures were taken in Irish coastal waters and only 4% (8) were recaptured from abroad (Quigley 2006). It has been hypothesised that the species may undertake a summertime northward migration into UK and Irish waters, supplementing a shoreward movement from deeper offshore waters, but there is, as yet, little evidence to confirm this.Females reach maturity at 128 to 169 cm total length (TL), and males at 80 to 132 cm TL off Tunisia (Capap√© et al. 1990) and at 102.8 and 99.9 cm TL, respectively, off of the Canary Islands (Osaer et al. 2015). They reach maximum sizes of 244 cm TL (females) and 183 cm TL (males) (Compagno 1984, 2005), with estimates of less than 240 cm TL in the Mediterranean Sea (Tortonese 1956). Age at maturity and longevity are unknown. This shark is lecithotrophic viviparous, with both ovaries functional. It has moderate-sized litters of 7 to 25 young which vary according to the size of the female (Tortonese 1956, Bini 1967, Capap√© et al. 1990, Compagno et al. 2005). Records of size at birth are 20 to 30 cm TL (Tortonese 1956, Bini 1967, Compagno et al. 2005, Meyers et al. 2017). Gestation period is 8 to 10 months (Capap√© et al. 1990, Compagno et al. 2005), with young being born from December to February in the Mediterranean, April to July in the Canary Islands (Meyers et al. 2017), and July in the UK. A nursery area has been located and is being monitored at Las Teresitas in Tenerife, Canary Islands (Esc√°nez P√©rez et al. 2016). Aggregations of up to 15 individuals of this species have been recorded in the Canary Islands (E. Meyers unpubl. data 2017).Reproductive age and periodicity, rate of population increase, and natural mortality are unknown. The species' generation length is estimated at ~15 years, based on data for its relative the Pacific Angelshark (Squatina californica) (Cailliett et al. 1992).&#160; ","Angelsharks are highly susceptible to bycatch in demersal trawls, bottom-set longlines, gill nets, and dredges. Demersal trawl effort had increased in both intensity and efficiency on the shelf and slope area of the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean over the last 50 years (with reduced effort in some areas in the last decade or so). The species was also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line and spearfishing techniques and this may have been a significant source of mortality in Irish waters (Quigley 2006), and may still be a source of mortality in the Canary Islands (Barker et al. 2016).&#160; Degradation of important Angelshark habitat through unsustainable coastal development and coastal infrastructure is of concern, especially in nursery areas identified in shallow inshore waters (Barker et al. 2016). Human disturbance by habitat degradation and tourism are also possible threats to its preferred sandy nearshore habitat. A low rate of exchange between fragmented Angelshark stocks may make them especially prone to local depletion and means that recolonization will likely be extremely low.","There are no range-wide population estimates for the Angelshark. The species was reported to be common, or at least frequently recorded in many areas, during the 19th century and early 20th century. It was still being caught regularly and considered common in the UK and Mediterranean at the beginning of the 20th century (Garstang 1903, Forrest 1907, Lozano Rey 1928).Steep population declines have, however, now been reported from several parts of this species' range, including the North Sea (ICES 2016), UK coastal waters (Rogers and Ellis 2000), the French coast (Quero and Cendrero 1996, Capap√© et al. 2000), and various parts of the Mediterranean Sea (e.g., Ferretti et al. 2005, 2013, Fortibuoni et al. 2016). The population has become very fragmented and the Angelshark has now virtually disappeared from much of its former range in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean.&#160;The species is now only observed regularly in the Canary Islands, although no accurate estimates on its abundance are available, with occasional records from elsewhere in the Northeast Atlantic (e.g. Welsh Coast (Irish Sea) and the western coast of Ireland (Celtic Sea)).Records in Wales have been increasing in recent years in areas where they were known to have been regularly seen in the 1960s and 1970s. There has been a reduction in fishing effort in Cardigan Bay in recent years. Sixty verified Angelshark records, spanning from 1960 to 2017, were gathered from recreational and commercial fishers in North Wales during a pilot project completed by Natural Resources Wales and Zoological Society of London in 2017 (J. Barker unpublished data 2017).In the Mediterranean, the species has been reported off the coasts of Tunisia and Algeria, although it was considered rare in the Gulf of Gab√®s (Bradai 2000). Furthermore, fisheries statistics indicate that 180 tonnes of angel sharks (Squatina spp.) were reported landed by Tunisia in 2015 - an increase from 125 tonnes in 2014. 174 tonnes were landed by Turkey in 2016 (FAO FishStat 2016). However, nothing is known of the pattern of effort associated with these landings. Reports of Angelshark from Turkish waters have increased since the mid-1990s and into the 2010s (√ñgretmen et al. 2005, Karakulak et al. 2006, Ismen et al. 2009, Bulguroglu et al. 2014, Ci√ßek et al. 2014, Kabasakal and Kabasakal 2014, Akyol et al. 2015, Yaglioglu et al. 2015, MEDLEM database), although numbers are still very low and this apparent increase could be due to more attention being paid to reporting angel shark catches.Data from scientific trawl surveys in the Mediterranean (mainly the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey‚ÄîMEDITS‚Äîand the Italian National Project (National Group for Demersal Resource Evaluation‚ÄîGRUND)) are in agreement with what is stated above. Catch data series from 1985 show a very low density of Angelshark in the northern Mediterranean - only two individuals were captured in 6,336 hauls between 1994 and 1999 (Baino et al. 2001).The ICES Working Group on Elasmobranch Fisheries (WGEF) considered that ‚Äúcomparisons of historical data with the near-absence in recent data (landings, surveys, observer programs, angling data) are sufficient to consider the species to be severely depleted in the Celtic Seas ecoregion and possibly extirpated from the North Sea ecoregion‚Äù (ICES 2016), supporting the view it is locally extinct in the latter area. ICES WGEF also noted that ‚ÄúWhilst its status in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coastal waters is unknown, it is considered very rare, with only occasional individuals reported‚Äù.In the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea, Vacchi et al. (2002) and Ferretti et al. (2005) reported the steep decline (&gt;90%) of angel sharks (all three species in the region), beginning as early as between 1898 and 1922.&#160;Trawl surveys in that area between 1972 and 2004 did not find any species of angel shark, suggesting declines of the genus until extirpation (Ferretti et al. 2005). In the Adriatic Sea, Ferretti et al. (2013) found a similar pattern, where the last report of Angelshark from five different scientific trawl surveys covering the period 1948-2005 dated back to 1958. Similarly, Fortibuoni et al. (2016) reviewed the historical occurrence of Angelshark in the Northern Adriatic, reporting declines &gt;90% and showing the collapse of the species in the early 1970s, even though they reported its current presence there. Maynou et al. (2011) stated that Angelsharks are likely to have disappeared in the Catalan Sea by 1959. In western Italy, Angelsharks would have disappeared by the early 1980s near the mainland and the mid-1980s in Sardinia. Declines have also been reported from studies off the Balearic Islands where this species, previously relatively frequent, may now be absent. Massut√≠ and Moranta (2003) reported no captures of any species of&#160; angel shark&#160;from four bottom trawl fishing surveys (131 hauls, at a depth range of 46 to 1,800 m) carried out between 1996 and 2001 around the Balearic Islands.Based on these historical declines inferred through changes in CPUE, a suspected decline in extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), and the contemporary rarity of the species, it is suspected that the Angelshark population size has been reduced by at least 80% (but likely closer to 90%) over the past three generations (~45 years).",Decreasing,"The Angelshark originally ranged from Scandinavia to Northwestern Africa (Morocco and the Canary Islands), including the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Current distribution appears to be reduced from this historic range, as a result of severe population depletion resulting in range contraction and localized extinctions; for example, it is now considered to be locally extinct in the North Sea (ICES 2005, although there is a museum record from Denmark in 2002 ‚Äì Zidowitz unpubl. data 2016) and is no longer encountered in some areas of the northern Mediterranean. However, reports of Angelshark individuals from the Celtic Seas ecoregion (ICES 2016, Natural Resources Wales data, Shark Trust data, Fitzmaurice et al. 2003,  W√∂gerbauer et al. 2014), Tyrrhenian Sea (Giusto and Ragonese 2014, Cavallaro et al. 2015), North Adriatic Sea (Fortibuoni et al. 2016), Aegean Sea (Kabasakal and Kabasakal 2004, Ogretmen 2005, Ismen et al. 2009, Karakulak et al. 2006), the Sea of Marmara (Kabasakal and Kabasakal 2014), and Mediterranean coasts of Turkey (Akyol et al. 2015, Yaglioglu et al. 2015), and Algeria (Ramdane and Trilles 2008) demonstrate that the species is still extant in these areas. In addition, it is still sighted regularly around the Canary Island archipelago (Meyers et al. 2017).&#160;","In Mediterranean and European waters there are no legitimate target fisheries for Angelsharks, however, in the past there existed fisheries (using gears similar to trammel/gill nets) directed towards them. Fortibuoni et al. (2016) mentioned ‚Äúsquaenera‚Äù in Italy and ‚Äúsklatara‚Äù in Croatia, apparently used until the 1960s. In the Balearic Islands, the term ‚Äúescatera‚Äù also existed, and was also used until mid-20th century (Morey et al. 2006). The Angelshark has been utilized by humans as a source of food for thousands of years. Its meat, considered light and easily digestible, was sold fresh or dried and salted, while its skin (shagreen) was used for polishing wood and ivory (Donovan 1802). The use of this species as food has continued into modern times and it also represents a source for shark liver oil and fishmeal (Fortibuoni et al. 2016). Given the coastal nature of the species, it was also subject to fishing pressure from recreational fishing in parts of its range, including the Canary Islands and off the coasts of Ireland and Wales (ICES 2016).The level of use and trade in this species in West Africa is unclear. It is presumably caught, either as bycatch and/or a targeted species, and is marketed for meat locally.",Marine," The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean has adopted a measure (GFCM/36/2012/3) to prohibit retention, landings, transhipment, storage, display, and sale of 24 species including the three native Mediterranean angel shark species listed on the Barcelona Convention‚Äôs Annex II of the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean. Regulation ((EU) 2015/2102) Article 16j further reinforces the GFCM measure for EU vessels prohibiting retention, landings and sale, and requiring live release where possible. Greater implementation would improve the effectiveness of all measures previously listed.Consistent with the Barcelona Convention, Spain has adopted a national regulation by listing all three native angel shark species present in Spanish Mediterranean waters in the Spanish List of Species Under Special Protection (Order AAA/75/2012). In addition, the procedure to list the Atlantic population of the three species of angel sharks in the Spanish Catalogue of Threatened Species has started and is still under administrative procedure at the time of publication.Israel listed all shark species under domestic regulations (Ariel and Barash 2015), although enforcement is insufficient. Croatia has also adopted species legal measures for protecting 23 shark species including the Angelshark and Smoothback Angelshark (Squatina oculata). In April 2018 through Communique 2018/19, the Turkish Government announced updates to Article 5 of the Turkish Prohibited Species lists (Communique 2016/35), with the addition of 14 elasmobranch species, which includes the three species of angel shark found in the Mediterranean.All three species of Mediterranean angel sharks are protected within Maltese waters since 2013, when they were included in the Environment and Development Planning Act (Cap. 504) under Schedule VI ‚ÄúAnimal and plant species of national interest in need of strict protection‚Äù.In 2009, the European Council released the Council Regulation (EC) N¬∫ 43/2009, which is applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in which it was stated that ‚ÄúAngelshark in all EC waters may not be retained on board. Catches of these species shall be promptly released unharmed to the extent practicable‚Äù. The Council Regulation (EC) N¬∫ 23/2010 listed Angelshark as one of the species that ‚ÄúIt shall be prohibited for EU vessels to fish for, to retain on board, to tranship and to land‚Äù. The scope also applies to ‚Äúfishing vessels flying the flag of, and registered in, third countries (‚Äòthird-country vessels‚Äô) in EU waters‚Äù. The Council Regulations are released annually (the most recent being 2018/127).Angelshark is listed in Annex III of the Bern Convention (Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats) and on Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). A concerted actions document published alongside the CMS listing outlines priority actions to be completed by the parties to improve protection of Angelsharks across their range.The Angelshark is legally protected in English and Welsh waters (from 0‚Äì12 nm) as it is listed on Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981). In addition, it is listed under the Scottish Elasmobranch Protection Order (2012), which prohibits retention.In 2005, the Irish Specimen Fish Committee (ISFC) removed Angelshark from the list of eligible species for record fish, thus promoting non-retention. Angelshark was then reinstated in 2016 with a view to encouraging data submission.OSPAR (the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) included Angelshark in the List of Threatened and/or Declining Species and Habitats (OSPAR Agreement 2008-6), in which it is categorised as a species under threat and/or in decline in the OSPAR regions where it occurs (OSPAR Regions II, III and IV). Additionally, OSPAR released the Recommendation 2010/6 on furthering the protection and restoration of the Common Skate species complex (Dipturus spp.), the White Skate (Rostroraja alba), the Angelshark and the Basking Shark (Cetorhinus maximus) in the OSPAR maritime area.There is an urgent need to confirm the status of this species in the Mediterranean, Celtic Seas ecoregion, and other areas where populations may still persist. Accordingly, appropriate conservation measures are needed to protect this species where regulations do not exist, or enforced if present.An Angelshark Action Plan for the Canary Islands was developed by a collaboration of partners in 2016 with the vision that ""Angelsharks in the Canary Islands are abundant and protected in their unique stronghold"" (Barker et al. 2016) The following goals are cited: 1) Angelshark fishing mortality is minimised in all sectors; 2) Critical Angelshark Areas are in good condition and threats are minimized; 3) The Angelshark and humans co-exist with minimal negative interactions; 4) The Angelshark and their habitats are protected through Canary Island, Spanish and International legislation; 5) Robust data inform effective Angelshark conservation; and, 6) The resident and tourist communities are aware of and actively support Angelshark conservation measures (Barker et al. 2016).&#160;Systematic monitoring and public awareness campaigns are in place in the Canary Islands as a result of work done by the Angel Shark Project, a collaboration between Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig, and Zoological Society of London (https://angelsharkproject.com/- Meyers et al. 2017).A broader Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Angel Shark Conservation Strategy was launched in 2017 outlining goals and objectives to better protect the three species (Angelshark, Sawback Angelshark, and Smoothback Angelshark) present in these regions (Gordon et al. 2017). The goals of the strategy are to: i) minimize fishery mortality; ii) identify and protect areas critical to angel shark survival, reproduction, and recovery; and, iii) identify human interactions and minimize the negative impacts. Policy priorities from the Strategy include (but are not limited to) listing the species on Spanish domestic fishery regulations (in process), and implementing GFCM measures, and including two additional species (Sawback Angelshark Squatina aculeata and Smoothback Angelshark S. oculata) in EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) (Gordon et al. 2017).The Angel Shark Conservation Network was created with the aim to facilitate collaborations and collect information about angel sharks throughout their range (www.angelsharknetwork.com). For this purpose, an interactive map (www.angelsharknetwork.com/#map) was created to register sightings.In 2018, Natural Resources Wales and Zoological Society of London launched the Angel Shark Project: Wales, a data gathering project that works with commercial and recreational fishers, communities in five focal areas and divers to gather historic and current Angelshark records in the region (www.angelsharknetwork.com/wales). A Wales Angelshark Action Plan will be developed with all partners involved at the end of the project, to identify ways to ensure continued presence of Angelsharks in Wales. &#160;  ",Palearctic,,False,False,Global & Europe,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

Overall it is suspected to have undergone a very rapid decline owing to habitat loss and conversion to agro-pastoral systems, declines in wild ungulate populations, hunting for trade, persecution, collision and poisoning.","It frequents open areas of Acacia woodland, grassland and montane regions, and it is gregarious, congregating at carrion, soaring together in flocks and breeding mainly in colonies on cliff faces and escarpments at a broad range of elevations. In Kenya, the number of nests at a colony may be inversely related to rainfall in the previous year, and timing of nesting varies from year to year (Virani et al. 2012).&#160;It locates food entirely by sight.","The species faces similar threats to other African vultures, being susceptible to habitat conversion to agro-pastoral systems, loss of wild ungulates leading to a reduced availability of carrion, hunting for trade, persecution and poisoning (Ogada et al. 2016). In East Africa, the primary issue is poisoning (particularly from the highly toxic pesticide carbofuran), which occurs primarily outside protected areas; the large range sizes of this and G. africanus puts them both at significant risk as it means they inevitably spend considerable time outside protected areas (Ogada and Keesing 2010, Otieno et al. 2010, Kendall and Virani 2012). In addition, the ungulate wildlife populations on which this species relies have declined precipitously throughout East Africa, even in protected areas (Western et al. 2009).&#160;In 2007, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses, was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2007). In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden in litt. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2007). The West African population has been heavily exploited for trade, with birds commonly sold in fetish markets (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Nikolaus 2006, Buij et al. 2015). It is one of the most commonly traded vultures in West and Central African markets, with numbers traded (1,128-1,692 individuals over a six year period in West Africa) probably representing a significant proportion of the regional population (Buij et al. 2015), with vultures being used in traditional medicine (W. Goodwin in litt. 2016). The Dogon of central Mali climb the Hombori cliffs to take eggs and chicks of this species (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). The decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria appears to be entirely attributable to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju practices (P. Hall in litt. 2011). It is apparently also captured for international trade. In 2005, 30 birds were reportedly confiscated by the Italian authorities (F. Genero in litt. 2005). Disturbance, especially from climbers, is a particular problem for this species. In Mali, the Hombori and Dyounde massifs are dotted with at least 47 climbing routes, on which expeditions take place every year, mainly during the species's breeding season. However, the impact of these activities is not known (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004).","Mundy et al. (1992) estimated a population perhaps of the order of 11,000 pairs, comprising 3,000 pairs in Tanzania, 2,000 in Kenya where ‚Äòup to thousands‚Äô concentrated at favoured sites, 2,000 in Ethiopia where it was said to be ‚Äòcommon to locally abundant‚Äô, 2,000 in Sudan where was the ‚Äòmost common vulture in the North‚Äô, and 2,000 for West Africa. This could indicate a population of 22,000 mature individuals and perhaps c.30,000 individuals at the start of the 1990s. Subsequent extremely rapid population declines mean that the population is now likely to be much lower.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;occurs throughout the Sahel region of Africa from Senegal, Gambia and Mali  in the west to Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia in the east. Also south through the savanna regions of East Africa in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. Formerly abundant, the species has experienced extremely rapid declines in much of its range, particularly West Africa. Although in Gambia it is apparently stable (C. Barlow in litt. 2006), comparative data have shown some colonies in Mali (J. M. Thiollay in litt. 2006) and South Sudan (Nikolaus 2006) have declined by up to 96% and 100% respectively, and it may no longer occur in Nigeria (no sightings in 2011 in last stronghold of Yankari Game Reserve, nor anywhere else in the country, P. Hall in ltt. 2011). Surveys of the Sudano-Sahelian savannas of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, carried out in 1969-1973 and 2003-2004, indicate a drop in the species's abundance from 61.3 birds/100 km to 2.5 birds/100 km (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). It has also declined in Cameroon (87% decline 1973-2000, Thiollay 2001), Uganda (D. Pomeroy in litt. 2006), Kenya (M. Virani in litt. 2006), Somalia (A. Jama in litt. 2011), Malawi (gone from Kasungu and Liwonde National Parks, where previously common, L. Roxburgh in litt. 2011) and Tanzania (J. Wolstencroft in litt. 2006), but may be stable in Ethiopia (Nikolaus 2006). Surveys show very limited populations, especially of breeders, in Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo and Guinea-Bissau (J. M. Thiollay in litt&#160;2016).&#160;It is vagrant in southern Africa, with a possible hybrid breeding attempt with Gyps coprotheres at Blouberg, South Africa (W. Goodwin in litt. 2016).&#160;Since the 1990s there has been a series of records involving small numbers of individuals in Spain and Portugal; these are believed to have crossed the Strait of Gibraltar with migrating G. fulvus, but breeding is not yet known to have taken place in Iberia. Now largely confined to protected areas throughout its range. ",,Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. This species occurs in a number of protected areas across Africa. It was included in a CITES Significant Trade Review. In 2007, a survey began to establish the extent of diclofenac use for veterinary purposes in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2007), and in 2008 an awareness-raising campaign at a conference of the World Organisation for Animal Health in Senegal led to a resolution being adopted unanimously by more than 160 delegates to ""request Members to consider their national situation with the aim to seek measures to find solutions to the problems caused by the administration of diclofenac in livestock"" (Woodford et al. 2008, C. Bowden in litt. 2008).&#160;At the 2014 Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Migratory Species, a set of guidelines to address poisoning was formally adopted (Ogada&#160;et al. 2016). The production of a Multi-species Action plan for the conservation of Africa-Eurasian vultures is underway.Conservation&#160;and Research&#160;Actions ProposedEstablish legal protection for this species, particularly in West Africa. Monitor remaining populations including at colonies, perhaps through a pan-African monitoring mechanism (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). Conserve remaining populations within protected areas. Protect breeding colonies. Maintain remaining wild ungulate herds within protected areas. Raise awareness amongst pastoralists of the dangers of using poisons for pest control. Discourage the use of diclofenac for veterinary purposes in countries where this does not already take place (BirdLife International 2007). Lobby governments to outlaw the marketing and sale of diclofenac for veterinary purposes (BirdLife International 2007).&#160;A number of recommendations were produced at the 2012 Pan-Africa Vulture Summit (Botha&#160;et al. 2012, Ogada&#160;et al. 2016): 1) Regulate import, manufacture and sale of poisons; 2) Legislate and enforce measures to prosecute those involved in illegal killing and trade in vulture species; 3) Protect and effectively manage breeding sites; 4) Ensure new energy infrastructure is 'vulture-friendly' and modify existing unsafe infrastructure; 5) Support activities to conserve vulture populations, including research and outreach activities.&#160;",Afrotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Recently published evidence suggests the population is experiencing an extremely rapid decline owing to indiscriminate poisoning, trade for traditional medicine, hunting, persecution and&#160;electrocution, as well as habitat loss and degradation.","The species is often associated with human settlements north of the Equator, but is also found in open grassland, forest edge, wooded savanna, desert and along coasts; and tends to occur at higher densities in areas where populations of larger Gyps vultures are low or nonexistent (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001. K. Bilstein in litt. 2016). It occurs up to 4,000 m, but is most numerous below 1,800 m. It feeds mainly on carrion, but also takes insects (and will congregate in large numbers during insect emergences [Smalley 2016]). In West Africa and Kenya it breeds throughout the year, but especially from November to July. Breeding in north-east Africa occurs mainly in October-June, with birds in southern Africa tending to breed in May-December. It is an arboreal nester, favouring Ceiba pentandra in Senegal (B. Bargain in litt. 2016), and lays a clutch of one egg. Its incubation period lasts 46-54 days, followed by a fledging period of 80-130 days. Young are dependent on their parents for a further 3-4 months after fledging (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Measurements of nesting success at the Oifants River Provate Nature Reserve, South Africa showed, success of 0.44-0.89 offspring per pair per year in 2013 and 0.50-0.67 offspring per pair per year in 2014 (Monadjem et al. 2016). ","Major threats to this species include non-target poisoning, capture for traditional medicine and bushmeat (McKean et al. 2013), and direct persecution (Ogada and Buij 2011, Ogada et al. 2016). In Nigeria, a survey of medicinal traders found that Hooded Vulture was the most commonly traded species of vulture, with 90% of all vulture parts traded belonging to the species (Saidu and Buij 2013). And across West and Central Africa the species is one of the most heavily traded, with an estimated 5,850-8,772 individuals traded over a six-year period in West Africa (Buij et al. 2015). Hooded Vulture meat is reportedly sold as chicken in some places. Intentional poisoning of vultures may be carried out in some areas by poachers in order to hide the locations of their kills, but in Senegal at least vultures to receive a form of cultural protection from such killing because they are the totem for some families (B. Bargain in litt. 2016). Secondary poisoning with carbofuran pesticides at livestock baits being used to poison mammalian predators is also an issue in East Africa (Otieno et al. 2010, C. Kendall in litt. 2012, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012). Declines have also been attributed to land conversion through development and improvements to abattoir hygiene and rubbish disposal in some areas (Ogada and Buij 2011), and, in Senegal, a decline in the number of their favourite nesting tree species (B. Bargain in litt. 2016). The species may also be threatened by avian influenza (H5N1), from which it appears to suffer some mortality and which it probably acquires from feeding on discarded dead poultry (Ducatez et al. 2007), although this is not well substantiated (C. Kendall in litt. 2016). ","Given evidence of recent declines in various parts of its range, this species's population is estimated to number a maximum of 197,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa; from Senegal (with higher densities in the West, for at least the southern part of the country, with possibly 2,350-2,700 pairs in the Ziguinchor D√©partment [B. Bargain in litt. 2016]) and southern Mauritania east through southern Niger and Chad, to southern Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and western Somalia, southwards to northern Namibia and Botswana, and through Zimbabwe to southern Mozambique and north-eastern South Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is generally sedentary, with some dispersal by non-breeders and immature birds, and movements in response to rainfall in the Sahel of West Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Data and observations of varying coverage and quality from various parts of its range suggest that the species is undergoing a very rapid decline in its global population (Ogada and Buij 2011, Ogada et al. 2016). Trends in Uganda are difficult to detect owing to strong annual variations (Pomeroy et al. 2012) whilst in coastal Gambia the species is reported to remain relatively abundant, and may have the highest densities left of this species (Barlow and Fulford 2013, Jallow et al. 2016). Following evidence of declines across its range, the total population has been estimated at a maximum of 197,000 individuals (Ogada and Buij 2011).

The species is being surveyed in parts of its range, including The Gambia, Tanzania, Kenya, and South Africa with plans for larger scale monitoring. Movement studies have been undertaken in several countries to assess ranging behavior and impact of commensalism on range size (C. Barlow in litt. 2016, C. Kendall in litt. 2016). The Hawk Conservancy along with the Endangered Wildlife Trust are currently working on providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to respond to a neutralise poisoned carcasses (C. Murn in litt. 2016). It is listed as Critically Endangered in the Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Allan 2015), and Endangered in Namibia and Uganda (Brown and Simmons 2015, WCS 2016). A multi-species action plan is in preparation for African-Eurasian vultures. Conservation&#160;and Research&#160;Actions ProposedCarry out systematic surveys throughout the species's range to acquire a more accurate population estimate and monitor trends. Raise awareness of the species's plight and the impact of hunting and persecution. Monitor rates of land-use change across its range. Monitor effects of poisoning on the species and its use in muti trade and for meat (C. Kendall in litt. 2012). Reduce human-carnivore conflict that motivates carrion poisoning, and monitor potential impact of lead poisoning from hunting activities on population - particularly targeted at farmers to reduce persecution and people in urban areas where the species can occur (C. Kendall in litt. 2016, K. Bildstein in litt. 2016). A number of recommendations were produced at the 2012 Pan-Africa Vulture Summit (Botha&#160;et al. 2012, Ogada&#160;et al. 2016): 1) Regulate import, manufacture and sale of poisons; 2) Legislate and enforce measures to prosecute those involved in illegal killing and trade in vulture species; 3) Protect and effectively manage breeding sites; 4) Ensure new energy infrastructure is 'vulture-friendly' and modify existing unsafe infrastructure; 5) Support activities to conserve vulture populations, including research and outreach activities.&#160;",Afrotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
43,North Africa,Emberiza aureola,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PASSERIFORMES,AVES,EMBERIZIDAE,Emberiza,aureola,A2acd+3cd+4acd,"This species has been uplisted to Critically Endangered because of indications that the overall rate of population decline is even greater than previously thought, and may have become extremely rapid during the past three generations (11 years).These declines, which apparently began in the west of the breeding range, have since spread eastwards to affect the vast majority or even the entire population. Declines are believed to be driven primarily by trapping in its passage and non-breeding ranges. A programme of coordinated range-wide monitoring and action is badly needed to quantify the magnitude of the decline and reduce the impact of threats. If the rate of decline is subsequently found to be lower, the species must no longer be listed as Critically Endangered regardless of it continuing to be an extremely high priority for conservation action.","It breeds in wet meadows with tall vegetation and scattered scrub, riverside thickets and secondary scrub. It winters in large flocks in cultivated areas, rice fields and grasslands, preferring scrubby dry-water rice fields for foraging and reedbeds for roosting (T. Gray in litt. 2007). The breeding season is normally from the second half of June to the beginning of July. The nest is built by the female alone and is placed either on the ground in a depression under tussocks or roots or slightly above ground in well covered vegetation. It is constructed of dry grass and stalks lined with soft grass, rootlets and sometimes hair. Clutch size can vary between three and seven but most commonly four to five. During the breeding season it feeds mainly on invertebrates and at other times it will feed on seeds and other plant material. The species is migratory, wintering from central and eastern Nepal, Bangladesh, north-east India east to south-east China (Guangdong) and Taiwan (Province of China), south to the north Malay Peninsula and south-east Asia&#160;(Copete and Sharpe 2016). ","Since many populations on pristine breeding grounds have dropped rapidly, the decline is likely to be driven by excessive trapping at migration and, in particular, wintering sites (Kamp et al. 2015, S. Chan in litt. 2003, 2007,&#160;P. Round in litt. 2003, M. Williams in litt. 2007). Roosting flocks in reedbeds are disturbed and then caught in mist-nets, they are cooked and sold as ""sparrows"" or ""rice-birds""; this practice was formerly restricted to a small area of southern China, but has now become more widespread and popular owing to increasing affluence, and hunters now have to travel widely to find sufficient birds (M. Lau in litt. 2007,  M. Williams in litt. 2007, S. Chan in litt. 2007). From 1992 onwards, an estimated several thousand individuals of this species were caught for the annual food festival in Sanshui City, southern China (Gao Yuren 1996). This practice was banned in 1997, but a black market in birds still persists and a huge number of birds are still sold annually (see Kamp et al. 2015), including around 10,000 birds sold daily in a single market in Sanshui (Chan 2004). In 2008, one shipment of 4,300 individuals of this species was reportedly confiscated in Zhejiang province en route to Guangdong province, and the species is said to remain a famous delicacy in southern China (per M. Zhang in litt. 2013). Likewise, the species is considered a delicacy in Cambodia (F. Goes in litt. 2013) and is trapped to be sold to restaurants in Nepal (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral in litt. 2013). In China, thousands of males are also stuffed and sold as mascots, since their presence in the home is thought to confer happiness (A. Mischenko in litt. 2012). At least locally, for example in Cambodia, birds are trapped for ""merit release"" in temples (Gilbert et al. 2012, J. C. Eames in litt. 2007, F. Goes in litt. 2013). Agricultural intensification, the shift to irrigated rice production and consequent loss of winter stubble has reduced the quality and quantity of wintering habitat, and the loss of reedbeds has reduced the number of available roost sites (T. Evans in litt. 2007,&#160;J. Tordoff in litt. 2007, J. C. Eames in litt. 2007). Declines caused by pressures on the wintering grounds are compounded by a reduction in habitat quality on the breeding grounds in parts of its range, particularly drying of meadows caused by changes in the flow pattern of rivers, a result of dam construction upstream (O. Goroshko in litt. 2003, J. Kamp in litt. 2007). Declines in Nepal have also been partly attributed to changes in agricultural practices since the 1980s, notably sharp increases in pesticide use (Inskipp and Baral 2011).","In Europe, the breeding population was estimated to number 20,000-100,000 breeding pairs, equating to 60,000-300,000 individuals (BirdLife International 2004). Europe, at least formerly, formed 25-49% of the global range. The European population is now estimated to number just 120-600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species once bred across the northern Palaearctic from Finland, Belarus and Ukraine in the west, through Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia, to far eastern Russia, Korea and northern Japan. However, after a precipitous decline it is now thought to have potentially completely disappeared from Finland, Belarus, Ukraine and large parts of Russia (Kamp et al. 2015). In the autumn, birds stop-over in large numbers to moult in the Yangtze Valley, China, before continuing on to their winter quarters. It winters in a relatively small region in South and South-East Asia, which includes eastern Nepal, north-eastern India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, southern China, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand (Byers et al. 1995). It was formerly one of the most abundant breeding passerines across vast swathes of Siberia, but although there have been no systematic surveys, a severe decline has been noted in most breeding areas and it has completely disappeared from parts of its former breeding range since the early 1990s (Kamp et al. 2015). No birds have been recorded breeding in Finland since 2009, and its range has contracted northwards by 300 km in Kazakhstan since the late 1990s, although it does persist in some areas of Kazakhstan, such as along the Irtysh river near Irtyshsk (R. Ay√© in litt. 2013). It is estimated to have declined by 95-99% in European Russia between 2000 and 2012 (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;Declines have been reported in the Moscow, Novgorod, Kostroma, Ulyanovsk and Baikal regions (A. Mischenko in litt. 2012), whilst very rapid declines in the Tyumen region were reported in 2011 (J. Kamp in litt. 2012), suggesting a massive decline in the core range (M. Flade in litt. 2007).&#160;Surveys in 2012 and 2013 suggest that the species has nearly or completely disappeared from Tyumen province in Western Siberia, which appears consistent with an impression of a steep decline across Western Siberia (J. Kamp et al. in litt. 2013). In contrast, recent surveys within and outside protected areas in Amur and Chabarovsk regions, suggest that the species is faring better in the east of its breeding range, with an estimate of 100-150 breeding pairs in Muraviovka Park (c.6,500 ha) in 2013, although anecdotal evidence indicates a decline in these areas since the 1990s (J. Kamp et al. in litt. 2013). Severe declines have also been noted in Hokkaido, Japan and Mongolia (Tamada et al. 2014, S. Chan and&#160;O. Goroshko in litt. 2003, Tamada 2006, M. Gilbert, A. Mischenko and J. Kamp in litt. 2007). Kamp et al. (2015) have estimated that between 1980 and 2013 the population may have declined by 84.3-94.7%, with an eastwards range retraction of 5,000 km.It no longer occurs in ""swarms"" at migration watch-points such as Beidaihe, China, and although a range-wide survey is required, numbers at wintering sites throughout its range have also shown rapid declines over the last twenty years (S. Chan, M. Williams,&#160;J. W. Duckworth and&#160;N. Moores in litt. 2003, T. Evans, M. Gilbert, M. Williams and&#160;S. Chan in litt. 2007). Based on evidence from wintering grounds in Cambodia the species is said to be clearly declining (T. Gray in litt. 2013). Historically, it was noted to be common on the central plain, but is now considered scarce away from the Tonle Sap area, and surveys of birds used in ""merit releases"" at Phnom Penh riverfront suggest a steep decline in this species since the mid-1990s in the Mekong-Bassac floodplain, where most merit-bird trappers operate (F. Goes in litt. 2013). Furthermore, there has been a lack of records from south-eastern Cambodia since the late 1990s, suggesting that it is very rare and perhaps close to extirpation in that region (F. Goes in litt. 2013). In Nepal, declines in the population and number of localities occupied have been noted since 1990 (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral in litt. 2013, Inskipp et al. 2016). It also appears to have declined at the Hail Haor wetland in north-eastern Bangladesh since the mid-1980s (P. Thompson in litt. 2013, 2017). It should be noted that interpretation of the species's status in its non-breeding range based on the usually fragmentary information available is hindered by the erratic appearance of very large flocks (J. W. Duckworth in litt. 2013).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation and research actions underwayCMS Appendix I; It was included in the African-Eurasian Migratory Landbirds Action Plan (AEMLAP) (African-Eurasian Migratory Landbirds Working Group 2014).&#160;It is counted occasionally as part of on-going IBA monitoring in a few sites. After media exposure of the crisis there was an attempt to clamp down on illegal trade in this species (S. Chan in litt. 2013), but this practice likely still persists (see Kamp et al. 2015). There is ongoing research on Sakhalin to find out if difference in migration strategies (e. g. key stopover and wintering sites) is responsible for contrasting sustainability of different populations. The study uses stable isotopes sampled from free-ranging birds and collection specimens, and geologger tracking of sustainable populations. (P. Ktitorov in litt. 2017).Conservation and research actions proposedImplement a programme of co-ordinated range-wide monitoring at breeding, passage and non-breeding sites, in order to quantify the rate of decline. Through awareness campaigns, reduce the demand for the species as a food item, mascot and merit-bird. Research its precise habitat requirements on the wintering grounds. Protect sites which still hold large numbers on the wintering grounds. Better enforce legislation against illegal trapping and trade (J.

44,North Africa,Rhynchobatus djiddensis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,RHINOPRISTIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,RHINIDAE,Rhynchobatus,djiddensis,A2bd,"The Whitespotted Wedgefish (Rhynchobatus djiddensis) is a large (to 310 cm total length) shark-like ray which is widespread in the Western Indian Ocean from South Africa to the Arabian/Persian Gulf. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore (including the surf zone) to depths of 70 m (usually shallower than 35 m). The taxonomy of the 'whitespotted wedgefish' species-complex (which includes several Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes) is not fully resolved, and the distribution of the Whitespotted Wedgefish may be refined when more information comes to light. The name&#160;Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;has been used extensively for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific, but it is now considered to occur only in the Western Indian Ocean. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity; the Whitespotted Wedgefish has litter sizes of ~4&#160;pups and an estimated generation length of 15 years.&#160;The ‚Äòwhite‚Äô fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Whitespotted Wedgefish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia (and while most of these datasets are outside the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific). While similar data are not available for the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish (with the exception of the Iran dataset which shows a 91% population reduction over the last three generations), actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species with the exception of South Africa, and there is nothing to suspect that similar declines have not occurred in the Western Indian Ocean. The Whitespotted Wedgefish has been targeted in East Africa, and there is anecdotal reports suggesting population reduction in countries such as Mozambique, Tanzania, and Madagascar. In South Africa, there has been a marked decline in the catch-per-unit-effort of Whitespotted Wedgefish in shark bather protection nets in KwaZulu Natal. However, this decline may not be a good indicator of abundance, as it may be explained, at least partially, by a shift in gear deployment whereby nets were gradually lifted off the substrate. Fishing pressure is less intensive in South Africa than elsewhere, but this country represents the southern extent of the species' range and only a small proportion of its distribution. Overall, it is inferred that the Whitespotted Wedgefish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Whitespotted Wedgefish occurs from close inshore (including the surf zone) to depths of 70 m on the continental shelf (usually shallower than 35 m) (van der Elst 1988, Last et al. 2016). Maximum size is 310 cm total length (TL) (typically smaller); males mature at ~150 cm TL (Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with a small litter size ~4 pups; size at birth is ~60&#160;cm TL (van der Elst 1988, Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016). Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information). The species appears to be partially migratory, as it is common in coastal waters of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa during the summer, with tagged animals traveling a mean distance of 49 km, reflecting locals movements only, while it occurs in much lower numbers during the winter; presumably it migrates northwards into warmer waters (van der Elst 1988, Young 2001, Mann 2003).","Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indian Ocean.In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017). In the Red Sea for example, the number of traditional boats tripled from 3,100 to 10,000 from 1988 to 2006 (Bruckner&#160;et al. 2011), and in Madagascar, the number of pirogues (small-scale fishing boats) rose from ~5,000 in 1983 to ~22,000 in 1996 (Cooke 1997). Most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g., Oman (19,000 artisanal boats) and Pakistan (2,000 trawlers) (Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017). Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally&#160;and the targeting of wedgefishes for their fins has also been reported in numerous countries, including Madagascar, Mozambique, and Tanzania (Cripps&#160;et al.&#160;2015, Barrowclift&#160;et al.&#160;2017, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Whitespotted Wedgefish is landed throughout its range (e.g., Pierce et al. 2008, Humber et al. 2017, Jabado 2018), with the exception of South Africa, and its distribution includes Iran which ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally (Lack and Sant 2011). Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is known to occur in some parts of the range, for example by foreign and regional trawlers in Somalia and Yemen, with wedgefish specifically targeted off East Africa (IOTC 2005, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017).In South Africa, the Whitespotted Wedgefish is caught in prawn trawl fisheries, shark bather protection nets, and recreational fisheries (Dudley and Cliff 1993, Fennessy 1994, Pradervand et al. 2011).The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Moore&#160;et al.&#160;2012, Jabado&#160;et al. 2017, Moore 2017). In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard&#160;et al.&#160;2010, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017).","Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;et al.&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;et al.&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., Rhynchobatus djiddensis) species-complex. The name&#160;Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that&#160;R. djiddensis&#160;is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016).Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion).&#160;In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally (Anticamara&#160;et al.&#160;2011, Watson&#160;et al.&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes, there are several relevant historical accounts and more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e., datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. While only one of the contemporary datasets is from the known range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish (the landings dataset from Iran), these are considered informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly.These historical accounts and datasets show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979); (2) the collapse of Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002); (3) the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes) in in the Java Sea (Blaber&#160;et al.&#160;2009) (recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea and North Natuna Sea recorded only three&#160;Rhynchobatus; Tirtadanu et al. 2018, Yusup et al. 2018); (4) declines in landings from Iran (see below), Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are the equivalent of 81-99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30‚Äì45 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018, M. Gore unpubl. data) (see the Supplementary Information); and, (5) significant declines in landings of 'guitarfishes' (which includes wedgefishes) in Tamil Nadu (86% decline for a 5-year period) and catch rates of rays (which does not include wedgefishes, but is representative of declines in demersal batoids) in Maharashtra (63% decline for a 15-year period) in India (Mohanraj&#160;et al.&#160;2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009) (see the Supplementary Information).To expand on point four above in relation to Iran (a range state of the Whitespotted Wedgefish), landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish (Rhina ancylostoma), Bottlenose Wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae), Whitespotted Wedgefish (R.&#160;djiddensis), and Smoothnose Wedgefish (R. laevis). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 91% population reduction over the last three generations of the Whitespotted Wedgefish (45 years).While this is the only time-series data available for the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish, fishing pressure (‚Äòactual levels of exploitation‚Äô) is high across the range of this species with the exception of South Africa (see Threats section), and there is nothing to suspect that similar declines have not occurred across large areas of the Western Indian Ocean. The following provides some species-specific examples of the situation relevant for the Whitespotted Wedgefish which supports this conclusion. In southern Mozambique, anecdotal reports suggest that artisanal longline fishing led to declines in the Whitespotted Wedgefish (which was one of the main target species of the fishery) as this species was abundant on reefs before longline fisheries began in the early 2000s and subsequently are only seen in low numbers&#160;(Pierce&#160;et al. 2008). In Zanzibar, fisher interviews indicated that there were perceived declines in wedgefish or that they are rare (Schaeffer 2004); wedgefishes were a retained bycatch of commercial prawn trawling in Tanzania (Rose 1996), and intense fishing pressure across the Tanzanian shelf is likely resulted in population reduction mirroring those outlined above for the Indo-West Pacific more broadly. In Madagascar, there was a decrease in the size of wedgefish caught in artisanal fisheries over time (Humber et al. 2017), thought, in part, could be due to the targeting of larger individuals. A steep decline in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) can be inferred from reported catch reductions from 10-20 sharks per day in 1992 to 1-3 sharks per day in 1995 in Morondava, West Madagascar, with fishers moving further afield to fish (Cooke 1997). Whitespotted Wedgefish, a high-value target species, would likely have declined by a similar order of magnitude.In South Africa, although the Whitespotted Wedgefish&#160;reaches the Eastern Cape Province, it is common only in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). There was a marked decline in CPUE of the species in shark bather protection nets in KZN during the period 1979-2017 (Nomfundo Nakabi, KZN Sharks Board, pers. comm. 2018). This decline is not considered to be a good indicator of population reduction as it may be explained, at least partially, by shift in gear deployment whereby nets were gradually lifted off the substrate (which would reduce the capture of demersal rays).Overall, it is inferred that this species has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction due to actual levels of exploitation over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.",Decreasing,"The Whitespotted Wedgefish is widespread in the Western Indian Ocean from South Africa to Oman and the Arabian/Persian Gulf, but it may not be present further east (Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016). However, the species' distribution may not be fully defined due to confusion with other members of the&#160;Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;species-complex.","Wedgefishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins.&#160;While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally.&#160;The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). Large whole wedgefishes (&gt;200 cm total length; TL) have been traded for a high value of up to US$680 each, however, smaller specimens can sell for low value&#160;(e.g. Jabado 2018). The ‚Äòwhite‚Äô fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;Qun chi&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;et al.&#160;2018).&#160;The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;et al.&#160;2018). The eggs of shark-like rays&#160;are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque&#160;et al.&#160;2018, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data).",Marine," There are limited species-specific conservation or management measures in place for wedgefishes. Some localized protections, trawl bans, finning bans, as well as general fisheries management and marine protected areas likely benefit this species, although in some areas, effective enforcement is an ongoing issue. The Whitespotted Wedgefish is protected in South Africa; catching or possession of the species is not legal without a valid permit. India has protected&#160;Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;since 2001 under Schedule 1 of the&#160;Wildlife (Protection) Act&#160;of 1972&#160;making its capture, landing, and trade illegal (Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017). However, the reclassification of wedgefishes (Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016) indicated that&#160;R. djiddensis&#160;does not occur in India, but the species present there are&#160;R. australiae&#160;and&#160;R. laevis, which are currently not listed under the Act.&#160;The&#160;Bangladesh Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act, 2012&#160;protects&#160;Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;under Schedule I, but again, the species occurring in Bangladesh are&#160;R. australiae&#160;and&#160;R. laevis&#160;(Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016). In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, Kuwait bans the catches of all rays; and in the Red Sea, all sharks and rays are protected in Israel (although both countries represent a very small part of the species' range). The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively), and other countries have seasonal trawl closures that may benefit the species. Finning (i.e. removing fins and discarding the body at sea) has been banned in several range states including the UAE, Oman, Iran, and Israel. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed. A Ministerial Decree issued by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) in 2019 imposes a permanent ban on fishing in UAE waters for shark species listed on CITES, and on CMS.Annex 1 of the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks (Sharks MOU) lists species that have an unfavourable conservation status and would significantly benefit from collaborative international conservation action. Currently (February 2019) 36 shark and ray species are included in Annex 1 of the Sharks MOU, including Rhynchobatus australiae, R. djiddensis, and R. laevis.To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring, including in artisanal fisheries, is needed to help understand population trends and inform management. Finally, taxonomy&#160;needs to be further resolved to improve certainty of species identification.",,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
45,North Africa,Sousa teuszii,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CETARTIODACTYLA,MAMMALIA,DELPHINIDAE,Sousa,teuszii,A3cd+4cd; C2a(i),"As with other species in the genus, Sousa teuszii has very precise habitat requirements, limiting its resilience and ability to escape environmental and anthropogenic stressors (Davidson et al. 2011). Remnant populations are faced with a suite of ‚Äúlargely intractable threats‚Äù (Ayissi et al. 2014) that either affect them directly, or contribute to the rapid and widening deterioration of their inshore habitats (Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Weir et al. 2011). Although there are no empirically derived abundance estimates for either the species as a whole or any of the putative populations, the available information indicate that these dolphins occur in very low and declining numbers throughout most or all of their range. Most populations for which any data are available are extremely small and several appear to be isolated. Available published estimates indicate that the total species‚Äô population size plausibly falls well below 3,000 individuals, suggesting that the number of mature individuals is less than 1,500 (following Taylor et al. 2007).Declines have been observed or are suspected for every known population, and continued declines are considered inevitable given the ongoing expansion of all identified threats throughout the species‚Äô known range. Bycatch in fisheries, the principal cause of the declines, has been identified or suspected everywhere the species has been studied. Directed killing has also been identified or suspected in several areas, and major threats to habitats (including ports) are increasingly prevalent (Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007; Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, 2015; Collins 2015). Ecosystem impacts that compromise vital rates may also have deleterious effects, including increasing the susceptibility of populations‚Äô to environmental stochasticity (Moore 2015, Weir et al. 2011). Appropriate management interventions that limit habitat loss and mortality from bycatch and hunting are limited or entirely lacking across the range, and in the absence of targeted and sustained conservation management efforts, long-term prospects appear grim.The available data for other species in the genus can be used to infer that S. teuszii has a low reproductive rate and thus a low intrinsic potential for population increase (Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014, Moore 2015, Taylor et al. 2007). Given the small apparent population sizes, any mortality over and above natural rates is likely to lead to appreciable declines in abundance. Moore (2015) estimated that given an inferred generation time of 25 years (as estimated for S. plumbea and S. chinensis), an average annual adult mortality rate of 5.3% would lead to an 80% decline over 75 years (three generations). Limited data for some areas (e.g., Congo) clearly demonstrates that non-natural mortality (particularly captures) is high and when considered alongside the scale of anthropogenic pressures, a population reduction of more than 80% over three generations is highly likely.The available information, much of it characterized by high levels of uncertainty, suggests that the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin merits classification as Critically Endangered (CR) under criteria A3cd+4cd. For the A criterion, a reduction of more than 80% in the total population over three S. teuszii generations (~75 years) is suspected, with declines likely to have begun with the rapid expansion of West African coastal fisheries during the 1980s, and bycatch likely to increase as new areas are targeted and fishery pressures increase. The reduction has not ceased, nor have its causes ‚Äì nor is there any reason to think they will in the foreseeable future. The inference and suspicion of the large decline in population size are based on the declining quality of the species‚Äô habitat (subcriterion c) and its vulnerability to mortality in artisanal fisheries (subcriterion d).","Atlantic Humpback Dolphins occur exclusively in shallow (&lt;30 m) waters that are frequently (but not exclusively) nearshore (Weir and Collins 2015). Recorded sightings are typically coastal, but the species may also occur some distance from mainland shores where suitable habitats are present (Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Weir and Collins 2015). Preferred habitats appear to be strongly influenced by tides and include areas of sandbanks, deltas, estuaries and mangrove systems (Maigret 1980, Ross et al.&#160;1994, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Weir et al. 2011, Weir and Collins 2015). They also occur on some exposed coastlines, although the available evidence suggests that densities in these areas are lower (Collins et al. 2010, Weir et al. 2011). Work completed by Weir (2015) suggests that in the area of the Rio Nu√±ez Estuary (Guinea) different S. teuszii groups ‚Äúmay vary in their site fidelity, habitat use and movements, and consequently in their home ranges.‚ÄùThey have been recorded some distance up rivers but there is no evidence that they ascend beyond the limit of marine intrusion (Maigret 1980, Van Bree and Duguy 1965, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Weir and Collins 2015). Maigret (1980) described a sighting at Foundiougne, in the main channel of the Saloum River, some 33 miles (53 km) from the estuary mouth, an area within the influence of tides (Van Waerebeek et al. 2004). In Guinea Bissau, they have been recorded 30 km upstream from the mouth of the Rio Grande de Buba and 20 km upstream from the mouth of the Rio Cacine (Leeney et al. 2015b, Van Waerebeek et al. 2000). A skull was collected in Gabon ca. 1949 at Kango, a village 95 km from the Gabon Estuary mouth and at the limit of saline intrusion; collection details are scant and the skull‚Äôs true origin is unconfirmed (Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Vande weghe 2005). More recent surveys in the Gabon Estuary, including as far upstream as Kango, yielded no sightings of S. teuszii (Collins et al. 2004). They are not known to enter the coastal lagoons that are a prevalent feature of equatorial West African coasts. For more detailed discussion of habitat preferences, see Weir and Collins (2015).Knowledge of the feeding ecology of S. teuszii is incomplete, as few stomach samples have been examined and direct observations of feeding are rare (Van Waerebeek et al. 2004). It is however clear that S. teuszii diets consist largely of coastal, estuarine and reef-associated fishes, many of which are characteristically vocal (Cadenat and Paraiso 1957, Cadenat 1959, Ladich 2000, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Weir 2009). Examination of the gut contents of net-entangled animals has provided direct evidence of S. teuszii diets and thus overlap with important fisheries. In Senegal the stomachs of net-entangled animals contained Sompat grunt (Pomadasys jubelini), bongo shad (Ethmalosa fimbriata) and mullet (Mugil spp.) (Cadenat 1956, Cadenat and Paraiso 1957, Maigret 1980). The stomach of a humpback dolphin entangled in the line of a fishing trap in Guinea Bissau contained snapper (Lutjanus goreensis), Atlantic emperor (Lethrinus atlanticus) and West African spadefish (Chaetodipterus lippei), (Sequeira and Reiner 1992). Initial analysis of otoliths and other remains recovered from the stomachs of humpback dolphins killed in coastal gillnets in the Republic of Congo indicates a diet of predominantly Longneck and Cassava croakers (Pseudotolithus typus, Pseudotholithus senegalensis), as well as unidentified flounders (Paralichthodes spp., Pseudorhombius spp.) and grunts (Pomadasys spp.). The full stomach of one of these animals, an adult, contained 29 royal threadfin (Pentanemus quinquarius) and a mantis shrimp (Squilla mantis; Collins 2015).Accounts of observed predation are few. In Mauritania single humpback dolphins were twice observed among pods of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) fishing cooperatively with Imraguen fishermen for mullet (Mugil cephalus, Liza aurata) (Busnel 1973). Duguy (1976) reported S. teuszii at the Banc d‚ÄôArguin chasing mullet in the channels between the Tidra and Nair islets. In Angola, S. teuszii were seen to feed primarily on South African mullet (Liza richardsonii). Also observed were the capture of an Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda) and herding of sardines (Sardinella spp.) although it was unclear if they were prey (Weir 2009).Foraging has been linked to rising (flood) tides (Van Waerebeek et al. 2003, 2004; Weir 2009 and references therein). In the Saloum Delta tides were thought to provide access to inner reaches of mangrove channels (referred to locally as ‚Äòbolons‚Äô) and mangrove edges (Maigret, 1980). In the Banc d‚ÄôArguin the link between tides and foraging was less evident, although daily movements into channels inshore were coupled with flood tides (Maigret 1980), and Duguy (1976) reported S. teuszii chasing fish in tidal channels between the Tidra and Nair islets. In the Bijag√≥s Archipelago (Guinea Bissau), S. teuszii were most frequently observed during low tide, suggesting that they fed when fish were concentrated in ‚Äúgullies and creeks‚Äù (Spaans 1990, Weir 2009).). In Angola animals performing longer dives (&gt;1 min) were presumed to be in pursuit of demersal fishes and benthic prey (Weir 2009); tail-up behaviours consistent with dives on demersal prey were also observed in deeper waters of the Rio Nu√±ez estuary (Weir 2015). Foraging has been observed at river confluences within the Rio Grande de Buba (Van Waerebeek et al. 2000). In the Saloum Delta preferential feeding areas include Djinack Creek, Bandiala, and Sangomar Point (Van Waerebeek et al. 2004).Observations in Guinea, although limited, suggest that S. teuszii observed in the shallow waters west of the √éle de Ta√Ødi spent relatively more time foraging than those in the deeper waters of the outer R√≠o Nu√±ez estuary (Weir 2015). S. teuszii observed off Flamingos, Angola, spent approximately half of their daylight time engaged in travel and foraging. Dolphins foraged preferentially around rocks and reefs, as well as at the mouths of rivers, including the typically dry Flamingo River (Weir, 2009). These tendencies may be shared in Gabon (Collins et al. 2004). Feeding activity in some areas is coincident with observations of larger aggregations, including the largest group sizes (20-40) recorded (Collins et al. 2004, Maigret 1980, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004 and references therein; Van Waerebeek et al. 2015).Information on reproduction is extremely scant. In the Saloum Delta, births were thought to occur in March and April, based upon observations of juveniles (Maigret 1980). This pattern was also suggested for Guinea Bissau (Kr√∂mer et al. 1994, as cited in Van Waerebeek et al. 2004). No neonates have been examined, but lengths at birth may be similar to those in S. plumbea (Van Waerebeek et al.&#160;2004). In Congo, a lactating female caught in a net during May (2013) measured 2.50 m (T. Collins unpub. data). The species is suspected to be sexually dimorphic (males larger at maturity and with a more prominent dorsal hump), but the current sample size (~20 animals) is too small to assess statistically (Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014). Taylor et al. (2007) estimated a generation length of 18.4 years for S. teuszii, although Moore (2015) provided a figure closer to 25 years for S. chinensis and S. plumbea. The data required to estimate generation length and other S. teuszii vital rates remain unavailable.Migrations and movements are poorly understood. Localized movements have been linked to feeding opportunities facilitated by tides (e.g., Dupuy 1983, Maigret 1980, Van Waerebeek et al. 2003, Weir 2009). Cadenat (1949) stated that in the Saloum Delta they are ‚Äúobserved daily on the dropping tide between Pointe Jackonsa and the mouth of the Djiombos‚Äù (Maigret, 1980; Dupuy, 1983), a tendency that helped to optimize encounters in later surveys (Van Waerebeek et al. 2003).Movements on larger scales are rarely documented, but have been inferred. Fishermen‚Äôs accounts from the Baie du L√©vrier and sightings at the Banc de Corbine suggested movement north of the Banc d‚ÄôArguin (Maigret 1980); sightings between Nouamghar and Nouakchott may indicate occasional movements south (Robineau and Vely, 1998). Maigret (1980) mused that animals from the Saloum Delta moved as far north as ‚ÄúYenne‚Äù (Yene Kao, ~100 km north of Saloum), and as far south as the Gambia River Estuary (~15 to 25 km). Landings of S. teuszii on the Petit C√¥te of Senegal provided some support for this idea (Cadenat 1956, Cadenat and Paraiso 1957), although capture locations were unknown (Van Waerebeek et al., 2004). More recent observations of S. teuszii groups passing between Barra and Buniada Points indicate routine movement between Senegal and The Gambia (Murphy et al. 1997), and a dolphin photographed crossing this border at Djinack (October 2000) provided the rationale for the species‚Äô Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) listing (Van Waerebeek et al. 2003; 2004).Larger migrations between the populations at Dakhla Bay and the Banc d‚ÄôArguin (ca 450 km), and the Banc d‚ÄôArguin and Saloum-Niumi (ca 750 km) regions are likely to be atypical, if they occur at all, given the distances involved (Maigret 1980, Van Waerebeek et al. 2003), although Robineau and Vely (1998) believed it ‚Äúinconceivable‚Äù that the Dakhla animals were isolated. Contemporary records led Maigret (1980) to hypothesise that Saloum Delta animals swam north to Mauritania during the May-December period; a stranding ‚Äòmidway‚Äô between Saloum Delta and the Banc d‚ÄôArguin provided minor support (Robineau and Vely 1998), but Van Waerebeek et al. (2003) rejected the idea given the availability of a larger dataset. These include bycatch and interview data, indicating year round occurrence in the Saloum Delta. There are no records between Dakar and St Louis, and very few from south of Nouakchott (Maigret 1980, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004). Van Waerebeek et al. (2004) suggested that movements between Saloum-Niumi and the Bijag√≥s Archipelago are probable, ‚Äúconsidering the relatively limited distance (ca. 280 km)‚Äù. Recent sightings near the Trist√£o Islands (Van Waerebeek et al. 2015) and in the Rio Nu√±ez suggest this connectivity extends into Guinea (Weir and Collins 2015) and Van Waerebeek et al. (2015) have since proposed a single 'Guineas stock', which combines the former 'Rio do J√™ba-Bijagos' (Guinea-Bissau) and 'South Guinea' stocks (sensu Van Waerebeek et al. 2004) into one.Beach-based observations by dedicated observers indicate routine movements of S. teuszii across the Gabon/Congo border within the Mayumba-Conkouati transboundary protected area (each containing 60 km of protected beach); it remains unclear if these animals range further afield (Collins et al. 2010). The very small population at Flamingos (Angola) appears to be both resident and highly localized in its occurrence (Weir et al. 2011). Records elsewhere suggest opportunities for transboundary movements (e.g., Ayissi et al. 2014, Bamy et al. 2010, Zwart and Weir 2014). Inferring demographic exchange (or the lack of such exchanges) between populations through analyses of genetics and/or photographs is not possible at this point, given a lack of samples or photo-identified individuals from almost all areas. If their distribution was once continuous (or less fragmented than it now appears to be), localized movements of the kind observed at Saloum-Niumi and between Congo and Gabon may have been sufficient for ensuring step-wise exchanges (and thus gene flow) between adjacent sub-groups (sensu Mendez et al. 2011).","The nearshore habitats of S. teuszii greatly increase its susceptibility to many anthropogenic threats. High human population densities, widespread poverty and habitat degradation (and destruction) associated with development are considered important determinants of the species‚Äô distribution and status (Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007, Weir et al. 2011). Fisheries within the range of S. teuszii are extensive and are a major source of income and protein (Belhabib et al. 2015, Brashares et al. 2004, Kaczynski and Fluharty 2002, Weir et al. 2011). Bycatches of S. teuszii in artisanal gillnets have been reported from most areas and for as long as the species has been studied, including the first records for some areas (e.g., Busnel 1973; Cadenat 1949; Campredon and Cuq 2001; Collins et al. 2010; Murphy et al. 1997; Robineau and Vely 1998; Van Waerebeek et al. 2000, 2004). This includes unverified fishermen's accounts of S. teuszii bycatches in Sierra Leone (Moore et al. 2010).Recent work in Conkouati Douli National Park (Republic of Congo) provides some indication of the substantial bycatch risk. A programme of intensive monitoring, enforcement, and cooperative (incentivized) reporting, identified 19 dolphin bycatches across all artisanal landing sites (n=14) on a 60-km stretch of protected beach over five years of work. Of these, 10 were S. teuszii, and the testimony of fishermen showed that all were caught in gillnets less than 1 km from shore (Collins et al. 2013). Although alarming mortality figures have been reported for other areas, including the Banc d‚ÄôArguin (Campredon and Cuq 2001, Robineau and Vely 1998) and the Saloum Delta (Van Waerebeek et al. 2004), the monitoring of bycatches is generally non-existent or limited to very few landing sites (e.g., Debrah et al. 2010, Moore et al. 2010). These figures are considered unrepresentative of the true toll, but bycatches are considered the principal cause for their range-wide decline and the greatest immediate threat for most populations (Ayissi et al. 2014; Clapham and Van Waerebeek 2007; Collins et al. 2010, 2013; Debrah et al. 2010; Jefferson et al. 1997; Northridge 1984; Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007; Van Waerebeek et al. 2004; Weir et al. 2011).&#160;Accounts of the deliberate capture of S. teuszii are rare (e.g., Cadenat 1949, 1956, 1957; Duguy 1976; Maigret 1980; Van Waerebeek et al. 2004), but directed captures likely occur in some areas (Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007; Van Waerebeek et al. 2000, 2015). Maigret (1994) believed that there were no traditional marine mammal fisheries in West Africa, but there is evidence that the opportunistic use of bycatches may develop into ‚Äúdirected entanglement‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-target-deliberate acquisition‚Äù (respectively, Clapham and Van Waerebeek 2007, Robards and Reeves 2011). The scale of this practice is unknown, but appears to be part of a developing global trend in the utilization of ‚Äúmarine bushmeat‚Äù and reflective of general fisheries declines (Alfaro-Shigueto and Van Waerebeek 2001, Brashares et al. 2004, Clapham and Van Waerebeek 2007, Leeney et al. 2015a, Robards and Reeves 2011, Uwagbae and Van Waerebeek 2010, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004). Debrah et al. (2010) noted that the sale of cetaceans and sea turtles contributes to the economic viability of gillnet fisheries in Ghana. This included the killing of live entangled animals, and the supply of dolphin meat to markets for shark bait (Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Weir and Pierce 2013). Captures may be concealed, given legal prohibitions (Reeves et al. 2003), hindering the acquisition of reliable data from surveys in some areas (Moore et al. 2010, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004).A related concern is the pervasive spread of migrant fishermen across western Africa over the past few decades (e.g., Bakhayokho and Ke¬¥be¬¥ 1991, Binet et al. 2012, Campredon and Cuq 2001, Cormier-Salem 2000, Duffy-Tumasz 2012, Leeney et al. 2015b). Migrant fishermen (including those who move within states) may not abide by local injunctions, taboos or laws, and are often better resourced and more aggressive in their exploitation of local resources (Campredon and Cuq 2001, Binet et al. 2012, Leeney et al. 2015b). They have been implicated in the captures of S. teuszii in areas adjacent to the Banc d‚ÄôArguin (Campredon and Cuq 2001). Fishermen from Senegal, Guinea (Conakry), and Sierra Leone exploit the waters of Guinea Bissau, which has a limited artisanal fishing tradition; captures of dolphins and manatees, and declines of nesting sea turtles have been reported, raising concern for S. teuszii (Almeida e Silva et al. 1999, Campredon and Cuq 2001, Leeney et al. 2015b, Maigret 1994, Powell 1990).Fisheries declines in general may affect populations of S. teuszii in a variety of ways, including reductions in the prey base and increased artisanal fishing effort, leading to greater risk of capture (Weir and Pierce 2013). Industrial fisheries compound this problem by competing for increasingly scarce resources, as well as fishing in zones set aside for artisanal fishermen and dolphins. For instance, trawlers fishing illegally within Conkouati Douli National Park (Republic of Congo) force artisanal fishermen to set their nets closer to shore (for fear of losing their nets in trawls), raising bycatch risks for coastal species (Collins et al. 2013).Coastal developments and their varied cumulative effects represent largely understated, unquantified and poorly recognized threats for S. teuszii (Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Weir et al. 2011). The species appears to be timid, and avoidance by dolphins of research boats making close approaches is seemingly prognostic of their susceptibility to disturbance (Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Weir 2015). Anthropogenic noise is an identified threat for cetaceans in general (e.g., Weilgart 2007), and for humpback dolphins specifically; noise from shipping and other industrial activities are considered threats to S. chinensis in Taiwan (Wang et al. 2007) and Hong Kong (Jefferson et al. 2009). Port developments are particularly prevalent, and preferred sites frequently overlap with the habitats of coastal dolphins; the scale of some ports suggests that they present effective physical barriers, and thus have potential for disrupting longshore movements throughout their operation. Indirect or ‚Äúnon-lethal‚Äù disturbances are likely during construction, and may become more permanent if maintenance (e.g., dredging) and urban development occurs at port sites (Jefferson et al. 2006, 2009). Animals seeking to avoid disturbance might be forced into less optimal areas, with unknown but presumably negative consequences for population health and fecundity, problems that can be exacerbated by coincident ecological constraints (e.g., Pirotta et al. 2013, Ayissi et al. 2014).Environmental contamination is a potential threat in some areas and may increase as development accelerates. The habitat preferences of S. teuszii increase the potential for exposure to terrestrial sources of pathogens and pollution (Weir et al. 2011). Phosphorite mining in coastal Togo contaminates inshore sediments with trace elements, including cadmium (Segniagbeto and Van Waerebeek 2010, Segniagbeto et al. 2014). Oil exploration and development are underway in many marine areas within the species‚Äô range. Spills and chronic pollution associated with some of these facilities may be detrimental to dolphin health but remain completely uninvestigated in S. teuszii.","There are no global abundance estimates for S. teuszii. Assessments for the stocks described by Van Waerebeek et al. (2004) were derived from survey work that was typically localized, sporadic and of limited duration. Varied survey methods were used that do not allow rigorous abundance estimation or comparison. The few associated ‚Äúguesstimates‚Äù are subjective and based on the experience of a limited number of researchers; these provide a crude index of abundance at best.Populations at the northern (Dakhla Bay, Western Sahara) and southern (Namibe, Angola) extremities of the range appear to be very small, which may indicate the limits of habitat suitability (Weir 2009). Beaubrun (1990) described the Dakhla Bay population as ‚Äúminiscule‚Äù, and sightings in the same area by Notarbartolo di Sciara et al. (1998) reinforce this impression. This population is likely limited to ‚Äúa few tens of individuals‚Äù (Van Waerebeek et al.&#160;2004). Recent sightings verified with photographs suggest that the subpopulation is still extant (Weir and Collins 2015). The Banc d‚ÄôArguin (Mauritania) and Saloum-Niumi (Senegal/The Gambia) populations have been estimated repeatedly at ~100 animals since the mid-1970s (Maigret 1980; Van Waerebeek et al. 2003, 2004). Incidental sightings from the southern Banc d‚ÄôArguin suggest that the species is sighted relatively frequently (Antonio Araujo, Fondation Internationale du Banc d‚ÄôArguin, pers. comm. January 2014). However, the stock has never been considered large by those who have completed assessments (Maigret 1980, Robineau and Vely 1998). In the Saloum-Niumi region, encounter rates and group sizes recorded during more recent surveys indicate a small population ‚Äúunlikely [to] exceed low hundreds, maybe less‚Äù (Van Waerebeek et al.&#160;2000, 2004).Data and sighting records for Guinea Bissau suggest the continued occurrence of a significant population of S. teuszii into at least the late 1990s (Powell et al. 1996; Spaans 1990; Van Waerebeek et al. 2000, 2004). Van Waerebeek et al. (2004) ventured a guess of ‚Äúat least several hundred, if not more‚Äù. A more recent review of sightings records indicates that S. teuszii is still widely distributed in Guinea Bissau (Leeney et al. 2015b), but sightings appear to be declining in regularity (P. Campredon, IUCN country program for Guinea Bissau, pers. comm. 11 May 2015). Recent sightings in the Rio Nu√±ez (northern Guinea) suggest that distribution across the Guinea Bissau/Guinea border may be continuous (Weir 2015, Van Waerebeek et al. 2015).Recent surveys in Cameroon yielded a single humpback dolphin sighting, despite extensive beach- and boat-based survey effort. A recorded encounter rate of 0.39 sightings per 100 km suggests that abundance there is very low (Ayissi et al. 2014). Boat surveys in Gabon have also yielded low sightings rates. Sporadic surveys between 2003 and 2006 yielded five sightings at an average rate of 0.15 sightings per 100 km. Recent surveys in the Gamba/Sette Cama region of Gabon yielded three sightings of S. teuszii with an encounter rate of 0.13 sightings per 100 km (Collins et al. 2010, Minton 2015). However, sightings rates during shore-based work in Congo are much higher (though are not comparable), and suggest that the coasts of southern Gabon and a limited area in the adjacent Republic of Congo harbour a total population in the high tens or low hundreds (Collins et al. 2013). Most of the Angolan coast is unsurveyed, but localised survey effort demonstrated that a small group of 10 individuals was resident in the Flamingos area (Weir 2009). A limited number of surveys on the Angolan side of the Congo River mouth between 2007 and 2009 failed to yield any sightings (WCS 2011).The absence of robust estimates precludes any quantitative assessments of trend. However, the evidence of recent work in some areas and a consensus of expert opinions indicates that most populations of S. teuszii are small and that all have experienced significant declines in recent decades (IWC 2011, Collins 2015). The principal cause of these declines are bycatches and directed takes although habitat loss is also likely a contributing factor (Ayissi et al. 2014; IWC 2011; Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007; Van Waerebeek et al.&#160;2004, 2015; Weir et al.&#160;2011). Limited research effort for each putative S. teuszii population has either identified significant mortality or yielded strong evidence to infer it. Of particular concern are recently reported dolphin bycatches and suspected declines in Guinea Bissau, which together with neighbouring Guinea, is believed to harbour the largest extant population (Leeney et al. 2015b).The prior IUCN Red List status assessment concluded that ‚Äúconsidering the relatively small numbers observed, and even taking account of the many areas of the species‚Äô range where there has been little or no assessment, the total population probably numbers only a few thousand‚Äù (Reeves et al. 2008). A review by Collins (2015) reinforces general inferences of small total population size. Considering the relatively small numbers observed, and even taking account of the many areas of the species‚Äô range where there has been little or no assessment, the available information suggests that the species‚Äô total abundance is below 3,000 individuals (Collins 2015). If it is assumed that 50% of these are mature (following Taylor et al. 2007), the likely number of mature animals in the total population is likely less than 1,500.",Decreasing,"Atlantic Humpback Dolphins are endemic to the tropical and subtropical nearshore waters of western Africa (Jefferson et al. 1997, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Weir and Collins 2015), ranging from Dahkla Bay (Rio de Oro) in Western Sahara (23¬∞52'N, 15¬∞47'W) to Tombua (Namibe Province) in Angola (15¬∞46‚ÄôS, 11¬∞46‚ÄôE). Each of the 19 states between (and including) Western Sahara and Angola are presumed to be part of the species' natural range. The current distribution is uncertain given incomplete research coverage, including an absence of survey effort in many areas. However the species has been recorded in 13 of these countries to date, including Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo and Angola (Bamy et al. 2010, Collins et al. 2010, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Van Waerebeek et al. 2015, Weir et al. 2011, Weir and Collins 2015, Zwart and Weir 2014). There are no confirmed records for Sierra Leone. Liberia, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, mainland Equatorial Guinea or the Democratic Republic of Congo. The species is not known to occur around any of the larger offshore islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including Sao Tome and Principe or Bioko (Fernando P√≥o) and Annabon (Pagalu) (Van Waerebeek et al. 2004).Areas of known occurrenceResearch in a few relatively well studied areas suggest that the species is patchily distributed and generally uncommon. Areas of regular occurrence in West Africa include the Banc d‚ÄôArguin (Mauritania), the river deltas of the Saloum-Niumi region (Senegal and The Gambia), the estuaries and islands of Guinea Bissau and the estuaries of northern Guinea. In Central Africa areas of localised density appear to be limited to Gabon (particularly the coasts of Wonga wongue, Ozuri-Loango and Mayumba) and the northernmost half of the Republic of Congo. Recent work suggests that densities are very low in the Gulf of Guinea states north of Gabon (e.g., Segniagbeto et al. 2014, Van Waerebeek et al. 2015). There have been recent sightings and/or records in Guinea, Benin, Togo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon and the Republic of Congo (Collins 2010, Minton 2015, Van Waerebeek et al. 2015, Zwart and Weir 2014).Areas of known absence/gap areasResearch indicates that the species does not routinely occur between Dakhla Bay (Western Sahara) and the Banc d‚ÄôArguin (separated by over 400 km) and the Banc d‚ÄôArguin and Saloum-Niumi regions (separated by over 700 km). This suggests that the distribution of S. teuszii may be discontinuous across this wider region, with highest densities in optimal habitats and occurrences on intervening coasts rare (e.g., Maigret 1980, Ross et al. 1994, Jefferson et al. 1997, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Zwart and Weir 2014, Van Waerebeek et al. 2015).Areas of unknown occurrenceMany areas, including within countries with confirmed records of the species, have received little or no systematic cetacean or coastal research. The presence of humpback dolphins in these areas is thus unknown and uncertain. This includes the coasts of Liberia and Sierra Leone, Equatorial Guinea, The Democratic Republic of Congo and much of the coastline of Angola (including Cabinda).Distribution gaps in some areas are likely to be the result of increasing anthropogenic pressure in once pristine regions (Van Waerebeek and Perrin 2007, Weir et al. 2011). For instance several sightings and bycatches were reported from the ‚ÄòPetite C√¥te‚Äô region in Senegal (between Dakar and the Saloum Delta) during the 1950s (e.g., Cadenat and Paraiso 1957), but neither areas were reported to yield sightings between 1975 and 1980 (Maigret 1980) and only one catch (in Fadiouth/Joal 1997) was later identified by Van Waerebeek et al. (2004) despite extensive survey effort.&#160; No records of S. teuszii have been reported in Ghana where there is an active dolphin fishery and extensive monitoring over many years at several fisheries landing sites; this suggests that the species has either been extirpated or is extremely rare (Van Waerebeek et al. 1999, Van Waerebeek et al. 2009, Debrah et al. 2010).Future work in poorly surveyed or unknown areas may well lead to new records. However they are unlikely to be frequent and the evidence from other parts of the range suggests that if humpback dolphins occur they will not be abundant (Van Waerebeek et al. 2015, Collins 2015).Accurately mapping the current distribution of this species is very difficult task given uneven and inconsistent effort across most of the range. The map provided with this account uses the 30 m depth contour as a limiting bound, and provides a very broad approximation of suitable habitats and (perhaps) an original range. The text provided in this account provides a more accurate description of current distribution, and should be used as the primary reference.","The sale of dolphin meat (of a variety of species) for either human consumption or bait has been documented or suspected from almost every S. teuszii range state. Evidence for the consumption and sale of S. teuszii specifically has been reported from Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone (unverified interview data), Togo (suspected), Nigeria, Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo. Many instances involve the secondary (i.e. non-targeted) use of dolphin bycatch, but it is clear that the species has been, and is currently, directly and increasingly, targeted for food in many areas (Ayissi et al. 2014, Bamy et al. 2010, Cadenat 1956, Clapham and Van Waerebeek 2007, Collins et al. 2013, Lewison and Moore 2012, Moore et al. 2010, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Van Waerebeek et al. 2015, Weir and Pierce 2013). Leeney et al. (2015a) report that ‚Äú42% of fishermen interviewed in Guinea-Bissau stated that they had accidentally caught a dolphin at least once and 37% of interviewees had eaten dolphin meat.‚Äù",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conserving the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin requires the proactive and urgent implementation of practical conservation measures (Ayissi et al. 2014, IWC 2011, Maigret 1994). Of utmost concern will be confronting the causes of localised declines, particularly fisheries bycatch, directed hunts and habitat loss (Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007, Weir et al. 2011). Inshore gillnet fisheries are considered the most significant threat, and explicit fisheries management measures to reduce bycatch need to be identified and implemented. Addressing fundamental ecological and biological data gaps is also vital, particularly for improving conservation and management decisions, especially in areas of development. This should include efforts to generate robust and comparable abundance estimates for areas of described occurrence and areas that are under sampled. Surveys for this species can be challenging, but the biggest limitations to date have been an absence of sufficient resources and local capacity to conduct needed work (Ayissi et al. 2014, Collins et al. 2010, Maigret 1980, Reeves et al. 2003, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Weir et al. 2011).The scale of coastal development and associated anthropogenic pressures suggests that identifying and protecting critical habitats (hotspots and foraging sites and areas between) will be pivotal for the conservation of this species. Nine range states (Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Cameroon, Gabon and Republic of Congo) and two states within the wider range (Equatorial Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo), have Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that incorporate proven or potential S. teuszii habitats (Hoyt, 2012; Weir et al., 2011). Their effectiveness varies; artisanal fishing and associated bycatches within these MPAs are known issues (Collins et al. 2013, Hoyt 2012, Van Waerebeek et al. 2003, Weir and Pierce 2013), and financing and lack of management capacity are common problems (e.g., Gallegos et al. 2005, Bennett and Dearden 2014). Explicit consideration of S. teuszii (and other threatened taxa) should be included in threat assessments (such as impact assessments) associated with coastal and estuarine industries (e.g., DEFRA 2011, BBOP 2012, IFC 2012) and where necessary additional and appropriate research undertaken to improve information gaps. If appropriately directed, mitigation actions associated with these projects could improve management of MPAs and/or other critical habitats (e.g., Bull et al. 2013, Pilgrim and Bennun 2014).Significant conservation concerns for S. teuszii have been raised for decades (e.g., Cadenat and Paraiso 1957, Maigret 1980, Van Waerebeek 2003, Van Waerebeek et al. 2004, Weir et al. 2011). In 2003, the IUCN Species Survival Commission‚Äôs Cetacean Specialist Group identified S. teuszii as a high priority for research and conservation (Reeves et al. 2003). In 2010 a range of specific research and conservation objectives for Atlantic humpback dolphins were also identified by the Small Cetacean Sub- Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee (IWC 2011). They represented a balanced consensus of scientific opinion and included deliberate consideration of earlier strategies, including the CMS Action Plan for the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (CMS 2008, Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007). Immediate action is clearly required if additional losses, local extirpations, and potentially even the extinction of the species, are to be avoided in the next few decades.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
46,North Africa,Rhina ancylostoma,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,RHINOPRISTIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,RHINIDAE,Rhina,ancylostoma,A2bd,"The Bowmouth Guitarfish (Rhina ancylostoma) is a medium-sized (to 270 cm total length) shark-like ray with a wide distribution in the Indo-West Pacific from South Africa to New Caledonia and north to Japan. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 70 m. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity; the Bowmouth Guitarfish has litter sizes of 2-11 pups and an estimated generation length of 15 years.&#160;The ‚Äòwhite‚Äô fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Bowmouth Guitarfish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Bowmouth Guitarfish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia. While some parts of Australasia provide refuge from intense fishing effort, this proportion of the species‚Äô range is not considered to be large enough relative to the global range to lower the assessment. It is inferred that the Bowmouth Guitarfish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Bowmouth Guitarfish occurs from close inshore to depths of at least 70 m on the continental shelf (Last et al. 2016). It&#160;occurs on or close to the seabed, mainly over sandy or muddy substrates, and also around coral reefs. Very little is known about the life history characteristics of this species. Maximum size is 270 cm total length (TL); males mature at 150‚Äì175 cm TL; females at ~180 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009, Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 2‚Äì11 pups and a size at birth of 46‚Äì48 cm TL&#160;(Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016).&#160;Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).","Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Bowmouth Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;et al.&#160;2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).&#160;Fishing pressure is however considerably lower across northern Australia.In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017). In the Red Sea for example, the number of traditional boats tripled from 3,100 to 10,000 from 1988 to 2006 (Bruckner&#160;et al. 2011), and in the Indian state of Gujarat, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen et al. 2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g., as reported in 2010: Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010), and most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g., Oman (19,000 artisanal boats), Pakistan (2,000 trawlers), Sri Lanka (24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004), and Indonesia (~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters) (Dissanayake 2005, CMFRI 2010, KKP 2016, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017).Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally&#160;and the targeting of wedgefishes for their fins has also been reported in numerous countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Tanzania (Cripps&#160;et al.&#160;2015, Barrowclift&#160;et al.&#160;2017, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Bowmouth Guitarfish is landed throughout its range (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007, Last&#160;et al.&#160;2010, Jabado 2018) and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Pakistan, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Iran (Lack and Sant 2011). Wedgefishes have been targeted in Indonesia since the 1970s, and these target fisheries have shifted spatially in response to localized depletions (Chen 1996, White and Dharmadi 2007, White and Sommerville 2010, Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016, W.T. White, pers. comm. 2015).Fishing pressure is considerably lower across northern Australia and in Papua New Guinea, which provides some refuge for this species. The degree of connectivity with Indonesia and elsewhere is however unknown, and if animals regularly move into Indonesian waters they would face significantly higher levels of fishing pressure there. There are no target fisheries for this species in Australia, but it is taken as bycatch in numerous non-target fisheries (e.g., Stobutzki et al. 2002). The introduction of Turtle Exclusion Devices in northern and eastern Australian prawn trawl fisheries is likely to have significantly reduced this species' mortality in trawl fishing gear (Brewer et al. 2006).Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is known to occur in some parts of the range, for example by foreign and regional trawlers in Somalia and Yemen, with wedgefish specifically targeted off East Africa (IOTC 2005, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017). In northern Australia, wedgefish account for a minor component of the IUU fishing. The IUU activity peaked in the mid-2000s, and although vessel numbers have declined since then, there is still some illegal fishing in the region (Field&#160;et al.&#160;2009, Marshall 2011, Harward and Bergin 2016).The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki et al. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore et al. 2012, Jabado et al. 2017, Moore 2017). In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard&#160;et al.&#160;2010, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017), while Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro et al. 2010).","Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous et al. 1998, Dulvy et al. 2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., Rhynchobatus djiddensis) species-complex.Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g., the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara et al. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e. datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance.With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber et al. 2009).Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g., 'whitespotted wedgefish' or 'guitarfishes') from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of wedgefishes and in each case probable species are listed.&#160;One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include wedgefishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae), Whitespotted Wedgefish (R. djiddensis), and Smoothnose Wedgefish (R. laevis). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 91% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bowmouth Guitarfish (45 years).Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country‚Äôs two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 98-99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bowmouth Guitarfish (45 years).Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-2004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of a 95% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bowmouth Guitarfish (45 years).Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj et al. 2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Bowmouth Guitarfish and 'R. djiddensis', and hence would therefore include Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 86% over this period. Furthermore, species-specific trawl landings data were reported for the Bowmouth Guitarfish, with a decline of 86% over this period. This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping likely includes Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, Clown Wedgefish (R. cooki), Eyebrow Wedgefish (R. palpebratus), and Broadnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bowmouth Guitarfish (45 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).Additionally,&#160;anecdotal reports suggest that artisanal longline fishing in southern Mozambique&#160;led to declines in the Bowmouth Guitarfish as this species was abundant on reefs before longline fisheries began in the early 2000s and subsequently are only seen in low numbers&#160;(Pierce&#160;et al.&#160;2008).The one region in which the Bowmouth Guitarfish may be in a better state than most of their range is Australia, where fishing effort is relatively low, Turtle Exclusion Devices reduce catches of large rays by 94% (Brewer&#160;et al.&#160;2006), and there are controls on their catch and retention. Estimates of fishing mortality rates in the Northern Prawn Fishery (the main fishery to interact with this species) for this, and similar species, are well below those that would lead to significant population declines (Zhou and Griffiths 2008).Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and the above information can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Australia, Papua New Guinea, and New Caledonia provide some refuge for the species, however, this proportion of the species‚Äô range is not considered to be large enough relative to the global range to lower the assessment. Overall, it is inferred that the Bowmouth Guitarfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.&#160;",Decreasing,"The Bowmouth Guitarfish is widespread in the Indo-West Pacific from South Africa through the Western Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, Southeast Asia, and extending north to Japan, south to Australia (where it is wide-ranging across the north of the continent), and east to New Caledonia (Last and Stevens 2009, Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016).","Wedgefishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins.&#160;The exception for this species is Australia where wedgefishes are generally not utilized or traded.&#160;While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally.&#160;The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g., Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). Large whole wedgefishes (&gt;200 cm total length; TL) have been traded for a high value of up to US$680 each, however, smaller specimens, and even large Bowmouth Guitarfish (&gt;150 cm TL) can sell for low value&#160;(e.g. Jabado 2018). The ‚Äòwhite‚Äô fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore 2017). Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for Qun chi (fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;et al. 2018). The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque et al. 2018). The eggs of shark-like rays&#160;are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque et al. 2018, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data).",Marine,"There are limited species-specific conservation or management measures in place for wedgefishes. Some localized protections, trawl bans, finning bans, as well as general fisheries management and marine protected areas likely benefit this species, although in some areas, effective enforcement is an ongoing issue.Kuwait bans the catches of all rays, and all sharks and rays are protected in Israel (although both countries represent a very small part of the species' range). Balochistan province in Pakistan protects all guitarfishes and wedgefishes and therefore this species is specifically protected in that province, while in Sindh province there are protections for juvenile guitarfishes and wedgefishes (less than 30 cm), including this species. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively), Malaysia has banned trawling in inshore waters, and other countries have seasonal trawl closures that may benefit the species. Finning (i.e., removing fins and discarding the body at sea) has been banned in several range states including the UAE, Oman, Iran, Israel, and Australia. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed. A Ministerial Decree issued by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) in 2019 imposes a permanent ban on fishing in UAE waters for shark species listed on CITES, and on CMS. The recreational line fishery in South Africa is managed by a bag limit of one/species/person/day&#160;(maximum of 10 total individuals per day)&#160;for unspecified chondrichthyans, which includes the Bowmouth Guitarfish (although enforcement is an ongoing issue). In Australia, Queensland has a recreational possession limit of one shark or ray, and the Northern Territory a possession limit of three. In the major prawn trawl fisheries of northern and eastern Australia, the bycatch of large elasmobranchs has been significantly reduced since 2000 with the use of Turtle Exclusion Devices in trawl nets (e.g., Brewer&#160;et al. 2006). In the Northern Territory and Western Australia there are prohibitions on retention of any shark product in several non-target shark fisheries.To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring, including in artisanal fisheries, is needed to help understand population trends and inform management. &#160;",,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 100 m. Giant guitarfishes have limited biological productivity; the Halavi Guitarfish has litter sizes of up to 10 pups and an estimated generation length of 10 years.&#160;The ‚Äòwhite‚Äô fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade.

Severe population reduction in the Halavi Guitarfish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia (and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Halavi Guitarfish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific). Furthermore, rapid declines have been documented in landings of the Halavi Guitarfish in the United Arab Emirates, and while some local trawl bans would likely benefit the species, actual levels of exploitation remain significant across the region.&#160;It is inferred that the&#160;Halavi Guitarfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (30 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.&#160;","The Halavi Guitarfish occurs from close inshore to depths of at least 100 m on the continental shelf (Last et al. 2016b).

In the Red Sea for example, the number of traditional boats tripled from 3,100 to 10,000 from 1988 to 2006 (Bruckner&#160;et al. 2011), and in the Indian state of Gujarat, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen&#160;et al.&#160;2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017). Most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g. Oman (19,000 artisanal boats) and Pakistan (2,000 trawlers) (Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017).Sharks and rays, including giant guitarfishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all giant guitarfish&#160;species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of giant guitarfishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Halavi Guitarfish is landed throughout its range (e.g. Spaet and Berumen 2015, Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado 2018) and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically India, Pakistan, and Iran (Lack and Sant 2011). The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (White and Sommerville 2010, Moore&#160;et al.&#160;2012, Jabado&#160;et al. 2017, Moore 2017). In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard&#160;et al.&#160;2010, Jabado&#160;et al.&#160;2017).","Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;et al.&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;et al.&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for giant guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues.Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g., the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;et al.&#160;2011, Watson&#160;et al.&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific giant guitarfishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e. datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. All of the historical accounts, and two of the five contemporary datasets are outside the known range of the Halavi Guitarfish, but are informative for understanding population reduction in giant guitarfishes more broadly.With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996) (it is suspected that this fishery caught giant guitarfishes as well as wedgefishes). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber&#160;et al.&#160;2009).Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g., 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of giant guitarfishes and in each case probable species are listed.&#160;One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include giant guitarfishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in giant guitarfishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish (Glaucostegus granulatus) and Halavi Guitarfish. Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of an 81% population reduction over the last three generations of the Halavi Guitarfish (30 years).Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country‚Äôs two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish, Halavi Guitarfish, and Widenose Guitarfish (G. obtusus). Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 94-95% population reduction over the last three generations of the Halavi Guitarfish (30 years).Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-2004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of an 86% population reduction over the last three generations of the Halavi Guitarfish (30 years).Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj&#160;et al.&#160;2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Sharpnose Guitarfish and Widenose Guitarfish but was also likely to include Giant Guitarfish (G. typus) and Clubnose Guitarfish (G. thouin). Landings declined by 86% over this period.&#160;This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping may include giant guitarfishes, but in any case, the trends can be considered representative of glaucostegids as well as rhinids. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of smaller glaucostegid species (30 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Halavi Guitarfish, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Overall, it is inferred that the Halavi Guitarfish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (30 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.",Decreasing,"The Halavi Guitarfish is endemic to the Arabian Sea and its adjacent waters in the Western Indian Ocean, where it occurs in coastal waters of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea from Kenya and Yemen to northern India (Gujarat), including the southern Arabian/Persian Gulf (Last et al. 2016b, M. Samoilys pers. comm. 2018).","Giant guitarfishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins. While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally. The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). The ‚Äòwhite‚Äô fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;Qun chi&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;et al.&#160;2018).&#160;The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;et al.&#160;2018). The eggs of shark-like rays are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque&#160;et al.&#160;2018, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data), and the snout of giant guitarfishes are considered a delicacy in Singapore where they are steamed and the gelatinous filling consumed.",Marine," There are limited species-specific conservation or management measures in place for giant guitarfishes. Some localized protections, trawl bans, finning bans, as well as general fisheries management and marine protected areas likely benefit this species, although in some areas, effective enforcement is an ongoing issue.In the Red Sea, all sharks and rays are protected in Israel (although this country represents a very small part of the species' range). Balochistan province in Pakistan protects all guitarfishes and wedgefishes and therefore this species is specifically protected in that province, while in Sindh province there are protections for juvenile guitarfishes and wedgefishes (less than 30 cm), including this species. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively), and other countries have seasonal trawl closures that may benefit the species. Finning (i.e., removing fins and discarding the body at sea) has been banned in several range states including the UAE, Oman, Iran, and Israel. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed. A Ministerial Decree issued by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) in 2019 imposes a permanent ban on fishing in UAE waters for shark species listed on CITES, and on CMS.To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring, including in artisanal fisheries, is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.&#160;&#160;",,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
48,North Africa,Numenius tenuirostris,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CHARADRIIFORMES,AVES,SCOLOPACIDAE,Numenius,tenuirostris,"C2a(i,ii);D","There are very few recent confirmed records of this species and sightings have become more and more infrequent, presumably as a result of declines caused by habitat loss and exploitation. No regular breeding, passage or wintering population is known, and the number of remaining individuals must be tiny. For these reasons the species qualifies as Critically Endangered.  ","Behaviour:&#160;This species is migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It is thought to breed in small colonies with nests between 2-3 m and 10-15 m apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Eggs have been found in May (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Early records often referred to the species as occurring in large flocks on migration and in winter. However, it is some decades since any sizeable flocks have been observed. The peak of the autumn migration appears to occur around September, with the spring migration peaking around March (Gretton 1991).Habitat:&#160;Breeding The only known nests were recorded in bog-forest transition zones (Gretton 1991) on the northern limit of the forest-steppe zone in habitat more typical of taiga marsh. This may represent either a very specialised breeding habitat requirement, or an unusual use of habitat at the limit of the species's breeding range (Gretton 1991). Non-breeding On migration and in winter, a wide variety of habitats are used, including saltmarsh, wet grassland, steppe grassland, fishponds, saltpans, brackish lagoons, tidal mudflats, semi-desert, brackish wetlands and sandy farmland next to lagoons. Large coastal wetland complexes may be especially characteristic, and most records come from close to the sea (Buchanan et al. 2010). Where it winters inland it inhabits marsh areas fed with freshwater, but with areas of Salicornia indicating that the ground has a high salt content (Gretton 1991).Diet:&#160;There is little information on its diet: birds at Merja Zerga (Morocco) fed on earthworms and tipulid larvae, while elsewhere insects (there is a suspiscion that orthoptera may have been an important food source [N. Crockford in litt. 2012]), molluscs and crustaceans have been recorded as prey. Breeding site: A nest found by Ushakov in 1914 was constructed of dry grass with a few leaves of rush Scirpus but little or no sedge (Gretton 1991). The known nests were situated on dry areas of sedge and bog moss some distance from willow scrub or birch grove (Gretton 1991). An analysis of stable isotopes in feather samples from museum skins suggest that the main breeding area was located further south than the historically confirmed sites; in the steppes of northern Kazakhstan and southern central Russia between 48¬∞N and 56¬∞N, with a core area around 50¬∞N (Buchanan et al. 2018). ","Threats on the breeding grounds are unknown. Within its potential breeding range, the taiga has been little modified, the forest-steppe partially cultivated and much of the steppe modified by agriculture. Habitat loss in the wintering grounds is of unknown importance. There has been extensive drainage of wetlands in the Mediterranean and North Africa and potentially important areas in Iraq. The conversion of European wetlands and central European steppes to arable farmland may have heavily impacted the species by depriving it of important habitats during migration (Gretton 1991). Historically hunting was high, and may have been the key factor in its decline. Following the initial decline, breakdown of social behaviour patterns may have prevented recovery. Historically a gregarious species, smaller groups or individuals may have difficulty in locating suitable stop-over sites on migration (Gretton 1991). Individuals may join flocks of N. arquata, being led to unsuitable wintering habitat and rendered unlikely to find a mate (Gretton 1991). ","The population is assumed to be tiny (fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals) based on the lack of recent records.&#160;There are no recent confirmed sightings of this species within Europe, where it formerly regularly wintered. At the European level, it is classified as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) (BirdLife International 2015). A record of an individual at Druridge Bay, Northumberland (Great Britain) in May 1998 was not confirmed (Collinson et al. 2014).",Decreasing,"This species has only been confirmed breeding near Tara, north of Omsk in Siberia, Russia, between 1909-1925. It migrates west-south-west from its presumed breeding grounds through central and eastern Europe, predominantly Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and the former Yugoslavia to southern Europe, Greece, Italy, and Turkey, and North Africa, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. It has also been reported from Slovenia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. Reports of birds staging in Ukraine persist but require confirmation. Regarded as very common in the early 19th century, it was already a rare bird by the 20th century, with regular records having dried up by the end of the century. Between 1980 and 1990, there were only 103 records involving 316-326 birds (BirdLife International 1999), and from 1990-1999, this dropped to 74 records involving 148-152 birds (BirdLife International 1999). Although there have been reports from Bulgaria, Ukraine and Uzbekistan of larger groups, most recent verified records have been of one to three birds, with the last nationally accepted record coming from Hungary in April 2001 (G. Buchanan and N. Crockford in litt. 2009, Ol√°h and Pigniczki 2010). In 1994, the population was estimated at only 50-270 individuals, but the paucity of recent confirmed records suggests it is now lower than 50 birds.  ",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I. CMS Appendix I and II. A Memorandum of Understanding, established under the auspices of the CMS, came into effect in 1994, and a working group was established in 1998 (Gallo-Orsi and Boere 2001). An international action plan was published in 1996. National action plans are in place in Italy (Nagy and Crockford 2004), Bulgaria and Ukraine. Several of the sites within the EU where the species has been recorded are designated as Special Protection Areas. There have been several international initiatives to survey passage and wintering sites (van der Have&#160;et al. 2001,&#160;Azafzaf and Feltrup-Azafzaf 2003, T. R. Cleeves in litt. 2006) and potential breeding areas (Gallo-Orsi and Boere 2001, Gretton et al. 2002), collate records (Gallo-Orsi and Boere 2001), protect key sites, raise public awareness (Azafzaf and Feltrup-Azafzaf 2003) and educate hunters. Details of a 'last push' to locate any remaining populations (focusing initially on surveys of historical wintering areas) were announced at the Ninth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Migratory Species in December 2008 (BirdLife International 2008,&#160;Crockford 2009,&#160;RSPB 2010). Surveys across the potential non-breeding range (from Morocco, perhaps as far as Japan) took place in 2009-11 with a particular focus on wintering and potential moult sites (G. Buchanan and N. Crockford in litt. 2012). The Slender-billed Curlew Working Group has developed a tool kit to assist people to identify and report Slender-billed Curlew in the field (available at: www.slenderbilledcurlew.net). If any can be found and caught then the sites used during the annual cycle could be determined by satellite tagging. An attempt to narrow down the search for breeding and moulting sites using stable isotope analysis and Strontium analysis of museum skins commenced in 2002 (Hilton 2003); results suggest that the main breeding area may have extended from southern central Russia into northern Kazakhstan (Nagy and Crockford 2004, G. Buchanan and N. Crockford in litt. 2012, Buchanan et al. 2018).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor key former and potential wintering and passage sites. Search for breeding grounds in the steppes of Kazakhstan, taking into account results of stable isotope analysis. Attach satellite transmitters to captured birds. Provide training in species identification along the migration route. Promote protection of habitat. Provide legal protection for this and similar species. Increase public awareness.

49,North Africa,Puffinus mauretanicus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PROCELLARIIFORMES,AVES,PROCELLARIIDAE,Puffinus,mauretanicus,A4bcde,"This species has a small breeding range and a relatively small population which is undergoing an extremely rapid decline, largely related to low adult (and immature) survival rates. Main threats are fisheries by-catch at sea and predation at breeding colonies by introduced mammals. Population models predict over 90% decline in three generations with an average extinction time of about 60 years, hence qualifying the species as Critically Endangered.","The Balearic Shearwater breeds in caves, burrows and crevices on islets and coastal cliffs in the Balearic Islands. Breeding colonies are relatively small, from isolated nests to loose aggregations of 10s or even a few 100s of breeding pairs (Ruiz and Mart√≠ 2004). The species is very philopatric, as is the rule with Procellariiformes. Adults do not commence breeding until their third year at the earliest, although most breeding recruitment tends to occur between 4 and 6 years (Oro et al. 2004, Genovart et al. 2016). Birds lay eggs in early-mid March (exceptionally late February); hatching occurs in late April-early May; and adults leave the colonies around late June, a few days before the chicks fledge (early July) (Ruiz and Mart√≠ 2004, Tan 2016).&#160;The species has been recorded diving to more than 35m (Meier 2015). Pelagic prey (especially small pelagic fish) seem to be the main food source for the species. It can also feed on planktonic organisms, and makes extensive use of discards both in the Mediterranean and when in the Atlantic (Le Mao and Y√©sou 1993, Arcos et al. 2000, Arcos and Oro 2002, Navarro et al. 2009, Louzao et al. 2011b, 2015, Bonnin 2016, Meier et al. in press). Fishing discards do though influence aspects of their ecology such as trophic (Navarro et al. 2009; K√§kel√§&#160;et al. 2010) and movement ecology (Bartumeus&#160;et al.&#160;2010), as well as potentially impacting life history traits&#160;(e.g. Louzao et al. 2006b, Genovart&#160;et al.&#160;2016).&#160;At sea, it has a rather coastal distribution, and tends to select productive shelf areas most often related to oceanographic frontal systems (Louzao et al. 2006, Louzao et al. 2012, Oppel et al. 2012, P√©rez-Roda 2015, Af√°n 2016). During breeding, birds tend to forage over the closest productive grounds to their breeding colony (Louzao et al. 2011a, Meier et al. 2015) coinciding with favourable winds during the outward stages of foraging trips (Af√°n 2016). Some individuals also head to productive areas at the extreme of their distribution, assisted by optimal winds during short time windows (Af√°n 2016). These productive waters are rich in small pelagic fishes (e.g. Palomera et al. 2007), where different types of fishing activity also co-occur and can provide substantial amounts of discards to shearwaters (Arcos and Oro 2002). The species appears to be more coastal during the non-breeding period (Arcos and Oro 2002; Mouri√±o et al. 2003; Arcos et al. 2012a; Oppel et al. 2012), forming large aggregations that vary in location between (and within) years, presumably due to fluctuations in the availability of schools of small pelagic fish (e.g. Le Mao and Y√©sou 1993).","This is a long-lived species and therefore the main threats to this species identified are those causing adult mortality. Adult survival is the main conservation concern, as this is unusually low for a Procellariiform (Oro et al. 2004, Genovart et al. 2016). The greatest threat at present is incidental capture by artisanal fisheries. Bycatch affects both adults and immatures, throughout the species‚Äô range, and has been shown to be the main driver of the decline of the species, with almost 50% of the mortality being caused by this factor (Genovart et al. 2016). Small scale vessels have been found to have an average bycatch rate almost 100 times higher than that observed on board medium-scale vessels (Tarzia et al. 2017). Demersal longlining seems to be the most problematic gear causing bycatch, although other fishing gears have been shown to also capture birds, and could have severe effects at the population level, including purse-seine, pelagic longlining and trawling (Arcos et al. 2008, Abell√≥ and Esteban 2012, Bou√© et al. 2013, ICES 2013, Oliveira et al. 2015). The species' gregarious behaviour and its close association with fishing boats while seeking discards means that occasional mass mortality is likely to occur when long-line boats fish close to flocks (Arcos et al. 2008, Laneri et al. 2010, Garc√≠a-Barcelona et al. 2010). Hence, bycatch appears to be fairly common, but often occurs on an irregular basis, suggesting that estimates derived from observations on a limited number of trips on board fishing vessels could be largely underestimated. Increasing evidence on this has been compiled in the last few years, with events of up to a hundred or more birds caught in a single event (Louzao et al. 2011, ICES 2013, Oliveira et al. 2015). Predation by introduced mammals is a major global concern for seabirds (Jones et al. 2008, Croxall et al. 2012), and a serious threat for this species. Black Rats Rattus rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, Feral Cats Felis catus and Common Genets Genetta genetta are present in c. 25% of the colonies and affect c. 38% of the breeding population (Arcos and Oro 2004, Ruiz and Mart√≠ 2004, Arcos et al. 2012c). Cat predation is thought to drive rapid declines locally and genets are occasional visitors with less clear levels of impact. The presence of rats is more widespread but has a lower impact, putatively affecting only breeding performance (depredating eggs and chicks, but not affecting adult mortality). Permanent monitoring programmes should be implemented to facilitate early detection of alien species in reference colonies.  Due to the congregatory behaviour of the species, acute pollution events, such as oil spills, also pose a serious threat, as a large number of casualties could result from a spill occurring in a congregation area (Ruiz and Mart√≠ 2004, Guti√©rrez 2011). Other threats include: the reduction of prey due to fishing overexploitation; a potential reduction in fishing discards (an alternative to the overexploited natural prey) and/or anthropogenic environmental change (Arcos 2011a) involving habitat degradation and disturbance in breeding grounds; background pollution (Oro et al. 2008); the development of marine windfarms (Arcos 2011a); light pollution which may disorientate and ground fledglings (Rodr√≠guez et al. 2015) and plastic pollution (Codina-Garcia et al., 2013, Bonnin 2016). Predation by Peregrine Falcons Falco peregrinus in the breeding colonies has also been recently reported (Garc√≠a 2009, Wynn et al. 2010), though this should be considered as a factor of natural mortality that likely has little influence on the decline of the species. The gradual northward movement of the non-breeding population may be affecting immature and adult survival, and this shift may be due to climate change or alterations in fish distributions as a result of fisheries' activities (Y√©sou 2003, Wynn et al. 2007). The recent demographic decline has not yet decreased the species' genetic variability, and connectivity found among colonies at least does not exacerbate the species' extinction risk (Genovart et al. 2007).&#160;","Estimates for the breeding population size in the last two decades ranged from about 2,000 to 4,500 pairs (Ruiz and Mart√≠ 2004, Arcos et al. 2011), with the current official figure being 3,142 pairs (ACAP 2012). This includes: Mallorca 900, Menorca 405, Cabrera 475, Ibiza 650, Formentera 712. However, these figures should only be taken as indicative, as breeding sites are often inaccessible, and therefore their census relies on indirect methods (e.g. counts of rafts, vocalisations, etc.) that are subject to strong biases and inaccuracy. This calls for particular caution in inferring population trends from such data, as estimates from one year to another might simply vary because of changes in methodological assumptions, people involved, environmental conditions during counts, or simply subjective perceptions. In fact, recent research at sea using two approaches (boat-based surveys and coastal counts at the Gibraltar Strait migration bottleneck) point to a global population of about 25,000 individuals, suggesting that the breeding population could be larger than previously assumed (Arcos et al. 2012b, Arroyo et al. 2014). Starting from these global figures, and assuming that the population structure was at equilibrium, Genovart et al. (2016) inferred a breeding population size of about 7,200 pairs, although this optimistic figure should also be taken with caution.",Decreasing,"The species breeds exclusively in the Balearic Islands, Spain, occupying the five major island groups: Menorca, Mallorca, Cabrera, Ibiza and Formentera. During the breeding period (late February - early July) the main foraging areas are located along the Mediterranean shelf of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly around the central Catalan coast, the Ebro Delta-Columbretes area and the Cape Nao (Arcos and Oro 2002, Louzao et al. 2006a, Arcos et al. 2012a, Meier et al. 2015), with individuals potentially exploiting the closest productive areas to their breeding colonies (Louzao et al. 2011a). Some birds also exploit foraging grounds at the extreme of their distribution in the continental shelf off Algeria and Morocco as well as in the Gulf of Lion (Ruiz and Mart√≠ 2004, Louzao et al. 2012, Meier et al. 2015, Af√°n 2016), in addition to the waters around the Balearic archipelago (Ruiz and Mart√≠ 2004, Louzao et al. 2011b). The bulk of the population leaves the Mediterranean after breeding, and concentrates off the Atlantic coasts of SW Europe in summer-autumn, mainly in Spain, Portugal and France, and also southwestern UK and northwestern Morocco (Le Mao and Y√©sou 1993, Ruiz and Mart√≠ 2004, Ram√≠rez et al. 2008, Arcos et al. 2009, Guilford et al. 2012, P√©rez-Roda 2015). Birds return to the western Mediterranean in autumn (mainly October), and spend the winter months roughly in the same foraging areas used during the breeding period (Le Mao and Y√©sou 1993, Ruiz and Mart√≠ 2004, Guilford et al. 2012).At one population, on Menorca, which shows evidence of past hybridisation with the closely related Yelkouan shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan), migratory behaviour and breeding phenologies appear to be intermediate with Yelkouan‚Äôs, with a majority of birds apparently remaining in the western Mediterranean post-breeding (Meier 2015).&#160;",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayAll breeding sites are currently protected as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the Natura 2000 network, with the unique exception of the colony of Punta Prima in Formentera, where new information has revealed that the prevailing colony lays right outside the SPA (and the overlapping Important Bird Area, IBA) designated for this species (Arcos 2011a). The management plans for the Balearic SPAs have not been implemented yet, and so plans are therefore limited to colonies covered by other designations, such as the National Park of Cabrera, the Natural Park of Sa Dragonera and Reserves Naturals des Vedr√†, es Vedranell i els illots de Ponent, among others. Rat eradication campaigns have been conducted at several colonies, including Cabrera archipelago and Dragonera Island, where, after a programme of aerial bait drops in 2011, no rats or mice had been detected (Mayol et al. 2012). Less effort has been directed at the most concerning colonies where carnivores are present (e.g. Formentera and Menorca).&#160;At sea, the Spanish Government designated in 2014 a network of marine SPAs taking as a reference the inventory of marine IBAs conducted by SEO/BirdLife (Arcos et al. 2009). Portugal also designated a few SPAs on the mainland coast recently, including congregatory areas for the Balearic shearwater previously identified as IBAs by SPEA (Ram√≠rez et al. 2008). France has also proposed a network of SPAs that include hotspots for the species. However, management plans for all the marine SPAs are still pending. Finally, evidence gathering for potential at-sea concentrations which could form SPA proposals are underway in the UK.&#160;Action Plans for the species have been published at local, national or international level in 1991, 1999, 2004, 2005 (Jones et al. 2008) and 2011 (Arcos 2011). A LIFE project for the species ran from 1991-2001 (Ruiz and Mart√≠ 2004), and Spain and Portugal had a joint LIFE project running from 2004-2008 aimed at identifying marine IBAs, including for this species (Ram√≠rez et al. 2008, Arcos et al. 2009). A number of actions have been implemented through Species Guardians SEO/BirdLife and SPEA as part of BirdLife's Preventing Extinctions Programme including: coordinated coastal and boat-based counts, gathering information to assess the impact of bycatch on the species, communicating and disseminating information on the species and contributing to the updated Species Action Plan published in 2011 (SEO/Birdlife and SPEA 2013).&#160;For demersal longlines, the most alarming fishery in the Mediterranean, significant work has been conducted in recent years at assessing the problem (Garc√≠a-Barcelona&#160;et al.&#160;2010, Laneri&#160;et al.&#160;2010, Cort√©s&#160;et al.&#160;in prep) and testing potential mitigation measures (Cort√©s and Gonzalez-Sol√≠s in prep), with nocturnal setting being a good candidate to minimize bycatch. However,&#160;work by BirdLife‚Äôs Seabird Task Force (STF) is studying the feasibility of implementing such measures, as well as other alternatives, with the aim of pushing for the adoption of an agreed solution in the near future, and has instead found that vertical longlines may be the best approach (Tarzia et al. 2017). The STF has also conducted engagement work with the fishing sector, conducting observations on board vessels and providing self-reporting logbooks (Tarzia et al. 2017).Despite the above advances, there is an overall lack of proper monitoring and conservation action by the relevant administrations. Most research, conservation and monitoring at present are conducted thanks to the initiative of a few research centres and NGOs (particularly BirdLife partners). This work includes bycatch assessment (questionnaires, onboard observers) and evaluation of mitigation measures, the identification of hotspots at sea through boat surveys, coastal counts and tracking studies (breeding and non-breeding grounds), and breeding monitoring and population demography assessment.Conservation Actions ProposedCreate a working group for the conservation plan, involving local and national bodies including representatives of the fishing industry. Thoroughly study the problem of bycatch by fisheries, plus implement appropriate mitigation measures throughout the whole distribution range of the species in order to mitigate this threat (i.e. implementation of the EU Seabird Action Plan to reduce bycatch). Control and eradicate introduced predators (with particular emphasis on carnivores) in breeding colonies identified to be at risk. Implement biosecurity measures to prevent introduced predators from re-establishing. Ensure effective protection for nesting sites and marine hotspots, and the implementation of monitoring schemes and management plans, including the monitoring of breeding colonies to estimate demographic parameters. Develop a rapid response plan for a potential oil spill close to main feeding and breeding areas. Continue to raise awareness among&#160;the fishing sector, and conduct further engagement with stakeholders. Study small pelagic fish populations in the western Mediterranean and in North East Atlantic (from the NW of Morocco to the English Channel) to assess extent of over-exploitation and how this affects the species. Assess the impact of pollutants and heavy metals on this species. Increase awareness of the negative impacts of light pollution near breeding colonies. Improve understanding of at-sea distribution, including during the non-breeding season. Conduct research to better understand the reasons for the discrepancies between breeding and non-breeding population estimates.",Palearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
50,North Africa,Pristis zijsron,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,RHINOPRISTIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,PRISTIDAE,Pristis,zijsron,A2cd,"The Green Sawfish (Pristis zijsron) is probably the largest of the sawfish species, reaching lengths in excess of 7 m, although currently lengths greater than 6 m are rare. Historically, it occurred widely in the Indo-West Pacific from southern Africa to Australia and Taiwan, including the Red Sea, Persian (Arabian) Gulf and some of the Indian Ocean islands. The Green Sawfish is a coastal species, with the young occurring in shallow nearshore waters, while the adults are more common offshore in waters to &gt;70 m. Its life history is poorly known, with data from the Gulf of Carpentaria (northern Australia) indicating that it has low intrinsic rates of population increase, making its resilience to fishing pressure low and its recovery from depletion slow. While the current population size and historic abundance is unknown, it is suspected as having declined in all of its range states. In Australian waters, its range has been well documented to have contracted significantly. Like all sawfishes, the toothed rostrum and demersal occurrence makes Green Sawfish extremely susceptible to capture in gillnets and demersal trawl nets. Historically, the population has been negatively affected by commercial net and trawl fisheries which operate in inshore areas throughout most of its range, the cumulative impacts of which have led to population declines. This species is now protected by no-take status in some range states (e.g. Australia, Bahrain, India), is listed on Appendix I of CITES, and is protected by some areas that are closed to fishing; but these actions alone will not be sufficient to ensure its survival in most regions. Despite a lack of quantitative data to support declines, available information indicates that populations of Green Sawfish are considerably rarer than historically across its entire range. Australia has some of the last remaining viable populations of Green Sawfish in the world, albeit at significantly reduced levels. Declines in the population are suspected to exceed 80% over three generation lengths (~44 yr), and it is possible that there has been localised extinction in a number of range states due to intensive fishing, reducing its extent of occurrence, and supporting its listing as Critically Endangered.","Green Sawfish are most common in shallow water coastal and estuarine areas, but occur to depths to over 70 m (Stevens et al. 2005). A 3.5 m female tracked in the Gulf of Carpentaria (Australia) over a 27 hour period remained in shallow water (mean depth &lt;1 m) and within 200 m of a mangrove shoreline (Peverell and Pillans 2004). Similarly, a 2.5 m male tracked in northwestern Australia showed similar movements, remaining in nearshore waters &lt;1.5 m deep (Stevens et al. 2008). The young are known to use nearshore and estuarine areas as nurseries, and adults occur more broadly and into deeper areas as evidenced by the occurrence of large mature individuals in offshore trawl fisheries in northwestern Australia (Stephenson and Chidlow 2003).Green Sawfish may be the largest of the sawfishes, with reports of individuals in excess of 7 m total length (TL). However, most reports suggest lengths over 6 m TL are currently rare. Mean size at birth in the Gulf of Carpentaria is 76 cm TL, and size at maturity at 340 to 380 cm TL (Peverell 2008, Last and Stevens 2009). Age and growth based on specimens from the Gulf of Carpentaria indicate that maturity is reached at about nine years, and maximum age may be &gt;50 years (Peverell 2008). Little is known of reproductive biology. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and litter size is about 12. Demographic models based on life history data from the Gulf of Carpentaria indicate that the generation time is 14.6 years, the intrinsic rate of population increase is very low (0.02 yr-1), and population doubling time is ~28 years (Moreno Iturria 2012).","Fishing is the primary threat to Green Sawfish. The large, toothed rostrum is easily entangled in fishing nets and other gear. In particular, inshore gillnet and trawl fisheries, which are common and intensive throughout much of the range of Green Sawfish, pose the greatest threat. Sawfishes are rarely targeted in these fisheries, but are regularly taken as retained bycatch because of the value of their fins, rostrum and meat. Data from specific fisheries is sparse, and rarely if ever to species level, making conclusions about the exact extent of the threats difficult to determine.Data for northern Australia is probably the most comprehensive, and shows that gillnets were responsible for ~80% of records of sawfish captures (Stevens et al. 2005). The gillnet fisheries in northern Australia that are likely, or known, to interact with Green Sawfish include the Queensland East Coast Inshore Finfish Fishery (Harry et al. 2011), Gulf of Carpentaria Inshore Gillnet Fishery (Peverell 2005), Gulf of Carpentaria Offshore Gillnet Fishery (Peverell 2005), Northern Territory Barramundi Fishery (Field et al. 2008), Northern Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery (Field et al. 2008), and the Kimberley Gillnet and Barramundi Fishery. Prawn trawl fisheries known, or suspected, to interact with Green Sawfish include the Northern Prawn Fishery, Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, and smaller prawn fisheries in Western Australia (e.g. Exmouth and Onslow) and New South Wales (NSW). The species is also known from fish trawl fisheries in northern Australia (Pilbara, Gulf of Carpentaria and Northern Territory). The take of Green Sawfish in recreational line fisheries is likely to occur at low levels, and recent education campaigns in Australia have aimed to reduce mortalities associated with these interactions. Outside of Australia the recent take of Green Sawfish in fisheries is poorly documented, partly because of its disappearance from many areas.Ecological risk assessments of fisheries in northern Australia that interact with Green Sawfish have demonstrated that this species is one of the most at-risk elasmobranch species within the region. Its large size, low biological productivity, propensity for entanglement, and high value of products all contribute to this vulnerability (Salini et al. 2007, Tobin et al. 2010). Similar conclusions can be made for similar fisheries throughout its range. More detailed assessment of trawl data from Australia‚Äôs Northern Prawn Fishery indicated that the recent level of take was close to the sustainable limit (Zhou and Griffiths 2008), and when combined with the gillnet take in the same area, would undoubtedly be in excess of the level of sustainable take. As such, even in Australian waters, threats to this species are ongoing and populations are likely to continue to decline. Green Sawfish are also taken in shark control programs in NSW, Queensland (Giles et al. 2004) and South Africa. The capture of Green Sawfish on all of these programs is now nonexistent (NSW and South Africa) or extremely rare (Queensland).Other threats to Green Sawfish include habitat loss (particularly loss of intertidal areas, and coastal development), pollution, loss of genetic diversity and climate change. However, relative to fishing, these threats are unlikely to substantially affect global status.","Data from northern Australia shows low to moderate levels of genetic diversity, with the lowest genetic diversity in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Populations in Western Australia and the Gulf of Carpentaria are distinct genetic stocks, with the remnant east coast population potentially also forming a distinct population (Phillips et al. 2011, Phillips 2012). Genetic data is not available for the remainder of the range, but given the Australian data the global population is likely to consist of a number of stocks.There are very limited data available on the size and trend of the Green Sawfish population, either at the global or national scale. In Australian waters, all sawfish species have undergone significant, albeit largely unquantified, declines; the southern extent of the range of Green Sawfish on the Australian east coast has contracted from Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), to the Whitsunday region of Queensland (Harry et al. 2011). The last records from NSW were in 1972 (NSWDPI 2007) and in Moreton Bay (Queensland) in the 1960s (Johnson 1999). Extensive surveys of fish landing sites throughout Indonesia since 2001 have failed to observe this species (W. White pers. comm. 2012), suggesting that its occurrence in this region is now questionable. There is some evidence from the Persian (Arabian) Gulf (A. Moore pers. comm. 2012) and Red Sea (e.g. Sudan) of small but extant populations. The lack of data from surveys and fisheries in much of the remainder of its range suggests that the abundance of this species has declined significantly in most, if not all, areas, and is now at only a small fraction of its historic abundance. A population decline of &gt;80% is suspected across the global range over the period of the last three generations.",Decreasing,"Green Sawfish have a broad Indo-West Pacific distribution, from South Africa north along the east coast of Africa, through the Red Sea, Persian (Arabian) Gulf, southern Asia, Indo-Australian archipelago, and east Asia as far north as Taiwan and southern China (Fowler 1941, Blegvad and L√∏ppenthin 1944, Smith 1945, Misra 1969, Compagno et al. 2002a, 2002b, Last and Stevens 2009). This sawfish may be the most tolerant of cooler waters, and as such has the most pole-ward distribution of all of the sawfish, at least in the southern hemisphere. For example, in Australian waters this species historically occurred as far south as Sydney on the east coast, while the limits of other species are much farther north. The Red Sea and Persian (Arabian) Gulf are regions of presumed historic abundance (M. McDavitt pers. comm. 2012, A. Moore pers. comm. 2012, R. Jabado pers. comm. 2012), as is the northwest of Australia (Morgan et al. 2011). Its current occurrence in much of this range is uncertain due to a lack of reliable data, but it is presumed to have been extirpated from much of this area because of intensive inshore gillnet and trawl fisheries. ","The Green Sawfish is (or likely has been) utilised for its fins, flesh, rostrum (as a trophy, curio or in traditional medicine), liver, eggs and skin. The protection of this species in some range states (e.g., Australia, India) means that take is prohibited. The meat of sawfish is sometimes utilised by Indigenous communities but the extent to which these communities harvest and utilise Green Sawfish is unknown; however, it is likely localised and at a low rate. There are also anecdotal reports of Indigenous people purchasing sawfish rostra off commercial fishers, painting and then selling them (Stevens et al. 2005). There was a small trade of live animals for display in public aquaria prior to the species‚Äô listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). See CITES (2007) for a comprehensive overview of trade in sawfishes.",Marine,"Green Sawfish are fully protected in Australia by a variety of Federal (listed as Vulnerable, Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999) and State legislation (Queensland, Protected [Fisheries Act 1994]; Northern Territory, Vulnerable [Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000]; Western Australia, Totally Protected [Fish Resources Management Act 1994]; New South Wales, Presumed Extinct). There are also a variety of specific fisheries regulations and reporting requirements in most Australian fisheries that interact with Green Sawfish. Sawfish are also protected in a number of range states, including India, Bahrain and Qatar. Although protected in these range states, the lack of enforcement or specific fisheries regulations, and ongoing gillnet and trawl fisheries, means that threats are ongoing.The Green Sawfish is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), prohibiting any international trade in the species. However, there is evidence that some Green Sawfish products (e.g., fins) remain in trade (M. McDavitt pers. comm. 2012).The use of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) is mandatory in some range states, though the benefit of these devices on sawfish is poorly quantified. In an Australian study they have been shown to reduce the catch of Narrow Sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata), however they and other sawfish species are still vulnerable to capture as their rostra become tangled in the body of the net (Brewer et al. 2006).Marine protected areas within range states may also provide significant conservation benefit to Green Sawfish. Within Australian waters, areas closed to fishing include ~30% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and some estuaries and inshore waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Northern Territory and Western Australia. Temporal spawning closures for barramundi, the target species in inshore gillnet fisheries in northern Australia, also provide substantial protection (up to three months in some jurisdictions). In other range states, areas closed to fishing also occur. There are no closures specifically to address threats to Green Sawfish. The effectiveness of all areas closed to fishing throughout the range remain uncertain because of a lack of information about the movements of Green Sawfish.Significant conservation benefits have been gained through education. In Australia, sawfish-specific handling guidelines have been developed and distributed to fishers in the form of printed material, videos and face-to-face training. This has aimed to maximise the survival of sawfish during release from fishing gear. Given the size and morphology of sawfish, releasing sawfish can be dangerous and historically they were often killed or de-sawed to make gear retrieval safer and easier. Thus development of handling guidelines (e.g., DEEDI 2010) may have significant benefit, and are also important for fisheries that operate in range states where they are fully protected (e.g., Australia). Conservation benefit may also be accrued from more general education of the public through display in public aquaria and through educational materials about sawfish such as outreach material provided to schools and other interested groups. However, to date such benefits have not been quantified. These activities increase awareness of the importance of these taxa and the conservation challenges that they face garnering public support for conservation actions.",,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
51,North Africa,Vanellus gregarius,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CHARADRIIFORMES,AVES,CHARADRIIDAE,Vanellus,gregarius,A3bcd+4bcd,"This species is listed as Critically Endangered because its population has undergone a very rapid reduction, for reasons that are poorly understood but are likely to be at least partly due to hunting along the migration flyway; this decline is projected to continue and increase in the future. Fieldwork in Kazakhstan (and counts in Turkey and the Middle East) has shown the population to be substantially larger than previously feared, but recent demographic studies have found low adult survival, possibly largely driven by hunting pressure along the migration routes and wintering grounds.  ","Behaviour This species is migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It breeds semi-colonially in small groups of 3-20 pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996) from mid-April until July, and begins the migration south in August or September (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (occasionally as late as October [R. Sheldon in litt. 2007, 2008]). Flocks of several thousand birds have been known to gather before migration in Siberia and Kazakhstan (Johnsgard 1981, R. Sheldon in litt. 2007, 2008), but migration itself usually occurs in small groups of 15-20 birds (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). In Syria, it arrives yearly around mid-February to late March, and again in Autumn (Hofland and Keijl 2008). It arrives on its wintering grounds in India and Pakistan by September-October, and in Sudan by late October (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Small flocks of a few to tens of birds are usual on the wintering grounds (Johnsgard 1981), although very occasionally larger flocks of over 100 birds have been recorded (Johnsgard 1981). It departs the wintering grounds in March or early April, arriving on its breeding range from mid April (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding It breeds mainly in the transition zones between Stipa and Artemisia grassland steppes where bare saline areas occur near water-bodies. It uses dry wasteland, cultivated, ploughed and stubble fields (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Nests are preferentially placed in areas of Artemisia where there is a high dung abundance and vegetation is short (Watson et al. 2006). Steppes that are densely vegetated may be avoided (Johnsgard 1981), however areas with a low percentage of bare ground and high percentage of tall vegetation are preferred by chicks, and may be important for providing cover from predators (Watson et al. 2006). It has been postulated that it evolved to nest in habitats created by migratory Saiga Saiga tatarica (e.g.&#160;Watson et al. 2006), but this is unlikely given the timing of Saiga movements relative to Sociable Lapwing breeding, the speed with which they pass through areas, and the very short swards favoured by the birds; nevertheless Saiga grazing combined with fires may have promoted optimal habitat (Kamp 2007). Suitable habitat probably occurred naturally in sparsely vegetated solonchaks and areas recently burnt by steppe fires, but are now most abundant in the periphery of villages, at least in central Kazakhstan (M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007). Around such villages, there is a strong positive correlation between grazing intensity and the density of nests (Kamp et al. 2009). Non-breeding On migration it uses mainly sandy plains with short grass, dry meadows, fallow land and cultivated fields (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The wintering grounds are burnt steppe and savannah, dry plains, sandy wastes, harvested millet fields, damp pastures and short grass areas, often adjacent to water (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In Arabia it often occurs in the desert near the coast (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Nest survival in central Kazakhstan between 2005 and 2012 was higher closer to human settlements, despite higher trampling rates, and when there were more neighbouring nests, but distance to settlements and colony density both varied systematically between years (Sheldon et al. 2013).Diet It feeds chiefly on insects including Orthoptera, Coleoptera, and moth larvae (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It also takes arachnids and frequently small amounts of plant matter including grains, leaves and flowers (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Small stones are often found in the stomach, occasionally along with the remains of small vertebrate bones and mollusc shells (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The diet is more varied during the breeding season, being limited mainly to orthopterans and other insects during the non-breeding season (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a scrape that is unlined or lined with plant material, pebbles and debris (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It is usually found on bare saline patches or in short vegetation near to water (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Nest survival during the egg stage varies between years, owing to varying levels of predation by fox Vulpes vulpes, polecat, long-eared hedgehog and souslik species, and trampling by cattle, and in particular, sheep and goats (M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007). ","Illegal hunting during migration and on the wintering grounds may now be the primary threat (M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007, Biricik et al. 2008, Fisher unpublished 2016). Data from 2005-2012 suggest that low adult survival, perhaps resulting from known hunting pressure along the migration routes, appears to be the most critical demographic rate (Sheldon et al. 2013).Other key factors explaining the magnitude of declines remain poorly understood, despite much recent research. On the breeding grounds, it was probably formerly threatened by the conversion of steppe to arable cultivation, plus, perhaps less likely, the reduction in grazing by large herds of native ungulates and, latterly, by the loss of the enormous herds of domestic grazing animals from state-sponsored collective farms (Eichhorn and Khrokov 2002, Watson et al. 2006). However, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, large areas of arable cultivation have been abandoned and are reverting to natural steppe habitat, herds of domestic livestock have become concentrated around villages (where their permanent presence leads to shorter swards than were created by the vast herds that grazed semi-nomadically under the Soviet system), while an increase in fires (owing to reduced control of fires) may also have contributed to an increase in suitable habitat. These factors may be behind the possible increase in numbers (at least in parts of Kazakhstan) in recent years (Watson et al. 2006, M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007). Concentration of nests in heavily grazed areas in the vicinity of villages may have increased threats from human disturbance and trampling by sheep, goats and possibly other livestock (Watson et al. 2006, M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007). Low egg survival due to nesting in areas of high grazer density has been suggested as one of the causes for the species' decline (Watson et al. 2006). Nest predation by Rooks Corvus frugilegus - which have expanded widely into the breeding range with the plantation of networks of shelter-belts (Belik 2005) - was previously suggested as a cause of declines, but data from central Kazakhstan indicate this is unlikely (Watson et al. 2006, M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007).  The species may be affected by the increasingly dry climate in its breeding and wintering range, but it is not clear if this benefits or threatens this semi-desert species (Watson et al. 2006). Agricultural expansion and intensification, overgrazing and loss of steppe habitats all pose threats to stopover sites used by the species (Ashoori et al. 2013, Sheldon 2013, Asswad 2014). An irrigation project distributing water from the&#160;Atat√ºrk dam to fields around Ceylanpinar may have a negative impact on the species as the habitats change (Fisher unpublished 2016).","Surveys in 2006 in Kazakhstan estimated 376 breeding pairs in an area of 145,000 km2. Extrapolating this population density across the breeding range yields a possible total population size of 5,600 breeding pairs, i.e. 11,200 mature individuals, roughly equivalent to 16,000-17,000 individuals in total; but work is continuing in order to refine this estimate. This total is consistent with record counts of 3,200 individuals in Turkey in October 2007 as well as more recent counts on the Uzbekistan/Turkmenistan border where it is estimated that 6,000-8,000 individuals were using the area (Donald et al. 2016).&#160;The European population is estimated at 0-10 pairs, which equates to 0-20 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"The species breeds in northern and central Kazakhstan and south-central Russia (and, at least formerly, Xinjiang province, western China [Kamp et al. 2010]), dispersing through Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and Egypt, to key wintering sites in Sudan (see below), Pakistan (a flock of 28 birds was recorded near Ahmedabad village in Jaffarabad district in 2015 [I. Fisher in litt. 2016]) and north-west India (e.g. 45 birds in the Little Rann of Kutch in November 2007 [Deomurari 2007], 30 at Great Rann of Kutch in November 2008 [J. Tiwari in litt. 2008] and in 2012, a flock of 90 birds was observed [Sheldon 2013]). Small numbers of birds winter regularly in Saudi Arabia,&#160;Oman and UAE. There are regular vagrant records in Europe and it has been suggested that a small number of individuals may overwinter in Iberia (de Juana 2011). The species has suffered a very rapid decline and range contraction. In northern Kazakhstan a decline of 40% during 1930-1960 was followed by a further halving of numbers during 1960-1987. More recent fieldwork has shown the population to be larger than once feared. Surveys in 2006 in Kazakhstan counted 376 breeding pairs in an area of 145,000 km2. Extrapolating this population density across the breeding range yields a possible total population size of 5,600 breeding pairs (Sheldon et al. 2006), i.e. 11,200 mature individuals. A satellite-tagged bird from central Kazakhstan was located in Turkey in October 2007 in a flock of 3,200 individuals (R. Sheldon in litt. 2007, 2008, Biricik 2009). Simultaneous counts made in March 2007 in northern Syria and south-eastern Turkey totalled 1,500-2,000 individuals respectively (Anon. 2007,&#160;Bozdogan et al. 2007, Hofland and Keijl 2008). Since then several birds have been tracked to wintering areas in Sudan (P. Donald in litt. 2016), indicating that the sites in the Middle East are used for stopping over en route to Africa. Surveys in September 2009 confirmed the importance of the Manych depression in south Russia as a stopover site with estimates of up to 2,000 individuals (Koshkin 2010).&#160;In &#160;autumn 2011, 2012 and 2013, 170, 50 and 72 individuals respectively were recorded in the Manych wetlands (Sheldon 2014). However few birds passed through the area in autumn 2015 (V. Fedosov pers. comm. to I. Fisher in litt. 2016), potentially as a result of cold, wet weather. Three satellite tagged birds flew directly across the Caspian Sea, a route previously only seen in the spring (I. Fisher in litt. 2016). Turkey has important stop-over sites at Mu≈ü Plain and Ceylanpƒ±nar Important Bird Area (1,300 birds were recorded at Ceylanpinar in October 2012 [Sheldon 2014]) (Sheldon et al. 2012). A record flock of more than 400 individuals at Lake Talimarzhan, Uzbekistan in September 2012 suggests that this area is an important staging site for the species (Fowlie 2012). In 2015, 4,225 individuals were recorded in Uzbekistan and 3,675 in Turkmenistan representing the highest numbers of the species recorded anywhere since the 19th century (Donald&#160;et al. 2016). The total number of birds using the area was estimated at 6,000-8,000, possibly representing the entirety of the species's eastern flyway population and potentially half of the global population (Donald et al. 2016). Despite survey work, no birds have been located so far in Iraq (Sheldon 2014).Estimates of productivity and survival on core breeding grounds in central Kazakhstan between 2005-2012 suggest that the population is in slight to severe decline, with a mean annual estimate of population growth rate of 0.81 (95&#160;% C.I. 0.64‚Äì0.98), while after five&#160;years of relative stability the number of nests in the same area declined rapidly after 2010 (Sheldon et al. 2013). In 2011, 105 nests were located but in 2012 only 44 were found (Sheldon 2013). These low numbers could be due to poor weather conditions during the breeding season (Sheldon 2014).&#160;Breeding site fidelity and natal philopatry were low and colonies fluctuated greatly in size between years, making estimation of population trends and survival difficult (Sheldon et al. 2013). ",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I and II. An international species action plan was published in 2004. An AEWA International Single Species Action Plan was adopted by the AEWA Meeting of the Parties in May 2012 (Sheldon 2013). It is legally protected in Armenia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, but this is generally not enforced (Belik 2005).&#160;An intensive research project at the breeding sites in central Kazakhstan began in 2004 (Cresswell et al. 2005, Watson et al. 2006), securing funding until 2009 (Anon. 2016). In 2005 the Sociable Lapwing research project was initiated in Kazakhstan by a team from the RSPB and the Association for the Biodiversity Protection in Kazakhstan (ACBK) in order to understand the causes of the species's decline. In 2006 the team secured funding through the UK Government's Darwin Initiative programme that will allow work to continue until 2009. The first co-ordinated count of breeding populations across Kazakhstan was undertaken in 2013, with analysis of the results in progress (Sheldon 2014). A survey of historical breeding sites in the South Urals was conducted in 2005 (Morozov and Kornev 2005) and another at passage sites in south-west Russia was carried out in 2006 (Field et al. 2006). Coordinated counts were undertaken at key passage/wintering sites in Syria and Turkey in March 2007 (Anon. 2007). Due to the current political situation in Syria, structured surveys have not been possible (Sheldon 2014). A project was initiated in Turkey in 2008 to gain a better understanding of stopover sites used by the species during migration (Biricik et al. 2008). Survey work in India was undertaken in 2012-2013 and a local language leaflet was distributed to raise awareness of the species (Sheldon 2013). Further surveys have recently been conducted in Sudan, Turkey (at Ceylanpinar), Iraq, Russia, Pakistan and Uzbekistan (Sheldon 2013). Fields surveys were conducted in Turkey in 2014/2015 and in Russia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia in 2015/2016 (Fisher unpublished&#160;2016), and surveys were planned for February 2016 in Pakistan. Surveys on breeding grounds are also planned for 2018 and 2019, using methodologies that would allow for direct comparison with previous surveys (I. Fisher in litt. 2017).A satellite-tagging project in central Kazakhstan aims to provide information on the species‚Äôs migration. Nine birds were tagged in 2010 although their tags are no longer in operation. Three birds were fitted with tags in 2013. Two of the birds migrated via Turkey before wintering in Saudi Arabia and Sudan, the third bird moved eastwards via Turkmenistan/Uzbekistan and Afghanistan before wintering in Pakistan (Sheldon 2014). Three more birds were tagged in June 2014 (Anon. 2015a), a further three in June 2015 (Anon. 2015b) and five more tags were planned to be fitted in August 2015 (Anon. 2015c). Of the nine birds with tags migrating in autumn 2015, two flew via Talimarjan to winter in Pakistan, four flew directly across the Caspian Sea (three wintering in Sudan, one lost contact in Russia), and the remainder travelled across the top of the Caspian Sea, down through Turkey, and into the Middle East and North Africa (I. Fisher in litt. 2016). Updates on their movements are posted on the Amazing Journey website (http://www.birdlife.org/sociable-lapwing/).&#160;Hunting in Syria has been identified as a major threat with measures being implemented to control it. Nature Iraq have been engaging with hunters and conducting awareness raising activities in Iraq (Sheldon 2013).&#160;The inaugural meeting of the International Sociable Lapwing Working Group was held in Palmyra, Syria in March 2011. The group agreed on conservation measures required by each country, and planned cross-border actions to protect the species across its extensive range. A large area around Ceylanpinar was designated as a no hunting zone in 2015 (Fisher unpublished 2016).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue research in Kazakhstan (and initiate in Russia) on breeding biology, habitat requirements and migration, including colour-ringing and satellite tracking to determine movements. Continue surveys of breeding range in Kazakhstan, potential breeding range in Russia and western China, and wintering/passage sites in Middle East and Africa (including determining periods when birds are present). Continue to monitor trends on breeding grounds and at key passage/winter sites. Identify and evaluate key threats on breeding, passage and wintering grounds.&#160;Ensure that all Important Bird Areas where the species is a feature are legally protected (Sheldon 2013). Investigate the importance of hunting on passage/wintering grounds. Review International Species Action Plan in the light of recent research on the breeding grounds and identification of key passage/wintering sites. Develop national species action plans, at least for Kazakhstan and key passage/wintering countries. At breeding colonies sensitive to trampling by sheep during nesting period, work with local shepherds to minimise disturbance. Control hunting on wintering/passage sites.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
52,North Africa,Pinna nobilis,ANIMALIA,MOLLUSCA,PTERIOIDA,BIVALVIA,PINNIDAE,Pinna,nobilis,A2be+4be,"This long-lived bivalve is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, where it has a range from Spain to Turkey along the northern and southern coasts and coasts of the Mediterranean islands.&#160;Since 2016, a devastating and geographically widespread mass mortality event (MME) has impacted P. nobilis populations throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Previous to the MME, the species was widespread and locally abundant in some locations. The mortality is caused by a pathogen (H. pinnae) and the associated die-offs have rapidly spread from the western (starting in Spain) to the eastern Mediterranean Sea in less than three years, causing mortality rates of 80-100% of the individuals in most locations, including those with long-term P. nobilis monitoring programmes. There are a few populations (less than ten subpopulations) that are known to remain pathogen-free and these are geographically isolated and located in sites characterized by very specific environmental conditions (lagoons with little access to the sea and differing salinities).The presence of the pathogen throughout the environment hinders potential population recoveries through recruitment, which opens a highly worrying scenario. Fan mussels strongly rely on the survival of adults for the maintenance of populations and the slow population dynamics and low recruitment could seriously hinder recoveries following catastrophic events. In the past, major threats were very localised and came from illegal fishing, habitat loss, boat anchoring, invasive species and most recently climate change. However none of these threats had led to the extremely widespread and rapid population declines in the species.&#160;The percentage of population size reduction over the last ten years is ‚â•80%, and the pathogen that has caused the MME is still present in the environment, with continuing declines expected. Therefore, this species is listed as Critically Endangered, mainly supported by criteria A2be and A4be.Continuous monitoring of the species populations is mandatory, as well in those sites where the species has recently disappeared in order to detect potential recruitment in the future. This assessment should be re-evaluated in five years to include additional information and particularly related to the evolution of the disease and the potential occurrence of resistant individuals and recruitment.","This species is a long-lived bivalve which occurs in coastal areas, between c. 0.5 and c. 60 m depth. Posidonia oceanica meadows are described as the main habitat of P. nobilis (V√°zquez-Luis et al. 2014a, Basso et al. 2015b, Deudero et al. 2015), although it is also found to inhabit Zostera marina and Cymodocea nodosa meadows (e.g. Russo 2012, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017). Additionally, the species is also known to form extensive populations on bare sand (Richardson et al. 1999, Katsanevakis 2007, Rabaoui et al. 2007), rhodolith and detritic beds (Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017), pebbly bottoms (Zavodnik 1967, Richardson et al. 1999), among boulders (Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017) or even in sediment-filled crevices and spaces in shipwrecks (Jim√©nez et al. 2017). It is generally absent from muddy sediments and in areas of severe sediment disturbance (Butler et al. 1993, Katsanevakis 2005, Tsatiris et al. 2018).Reproduction of the fan mussel has been reported to occur mainly between May and August (de Gaulejac 1995, Deudero et al. 2017, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017). Even though earlier studies estimated a larval period of about 10 days (Butler et al. 1993, de Gaulejac 1995), recent research has suggested that larval stages could last at least one month (Deudero et al. 2017, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017, Trigos et al. 2018). In the western Mediterranean, larval settlement concentrates mainly between July and October, peaking in August‚ÄìSeptember (Cabanellas-Reboredo et al. 2009, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017).Recruitment is a key component of the population dynamics of P. nobilis, and hence also key to the recovery potential of impacted populations. The use of larval collectors has proven to be a useful tool for assessing recruitment potential in P. nobilis, providing insights into larval supply and recruitment prior to the exposure to pressures such as predation or dislodgement which act on benthic individuals (de Gaulejac et al. 2003, Cabanellas-Reboredo et al. 2009, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017, Wesselmann et al. 2018). During field surveys significant differences in recruitment in the larval collectors have been found in those populations occurring in well-preserved ecosystems (e.g., MPAs), where predators are abundant (Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017). In these environments where the threats are due to predatory pressures, survival is enhanced where the refuge size is 45 cm (Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017).Pinna nobilis populations have been described as a meta-population with source-sink dynamics, i.e., with areas like the Ebro Delta (Spain) acting as larval source and others like Alicante (Spain) acting as sink populations (Wesselmann et al. 2018). Wesselmann et al. (2018) showed that P. nobilis populations have high genetic diversity and low inter-population differentiation and suggested that this discovery has strong consequences for the conservation of the species, as it allows to reject the highest concern hypothesis of small isolated populations. Connectivity patterns of the species are strongly influenced by oceanographic currents, highlighting the importance of ocean currents and pelagic larvae transport in shaping the population connectivity of P. nobilis (Wesselmann et al. 2018). Ongoing genetic studies will provide in short further fine scale genetic information on P. nobilis populations from Spain, France and Montenegro (N. Vicente pers. comm. 2018). Additionally, the genome sequencing of P. nobilis has been recently undertaken (Bunet et al. submitted, 2019). The population dynamics of P. nobilis in populations occurring in well-conserved sites are described as parsimonious, characterized by low mortality and recruitment rates e.g. Columbretes Islands Marine Reserve (Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017) and Cabrera National Park (V√°zquez-Luis et al. 2017b). At these sites, fan mussels strongly rely on the survival of adults for the maintenance of populations and the slow dynamics could seriously hinder recoveries in front of catastrophic events (Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017). Mortality rates are negatively correlated to the size of the P. nobilis individuals (Katsanevakis 2007, 2009).Growth rates in this species are quite high during the first years of life (Hendriks&#160;et al.&#160;2012,&#160;Ko≈æul et al. 2012, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017), slowing down as the fan mussels grow. Hendriks et al. (2012) estimated growth rates of 0.18 mm day-1 (in the laboratory) and 0.28-0.32 mm day-1 (in the field), Kersting and Garc√≠a-March (2017) reported growth rates in the field of 0.31-0.32 mm day-1, during the first year of live and of 7.8-7.9 mm month-1 during the first two years of life. Katsanevakis (2007) reported a peak in growth rates in Lake Vouliagmeni (Greece) at an age ~9 to 11 months followed by declining growth rates with age. In the same study, a seasonality in growth rates was observed, with the lowest growth rates during the cold season (November‚Äìmid-March) and during the temperature peak in August (with temperatures exceeding 29 ¬∫C), and the highest growth rates during late spring-early summer (Katsanevakis 2007). Trigos et al. (2015), reported growth rates in the laboratory of 0.26 mm day-1, and after nine months of rearing they reached an average size of 96.7¬±14 mm, thus gaining 70.4¬±10.6 mm, which is similar to that registered for the same species in natural conditions (Ko≈æul et al. 2012).Several growth equations have been proposed for the species, with a large variability in reported growth patterns among fan mussel populations (≈†iletiƒá and Peharda 2003, Rabaoui et al. 2007, Katsanevakis 2007, Hendriks et al. 2012, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017). Garc√≠a-March et al.&#160;2019 proposed three general growth models related to broad environmental conditions (exposed open-sea, sheltered open-sea and lagoons) to be used when no specific model could be calculated for a population.Hydrodynamics seem to be a determinant factor in the ecology of P. nobilis, affecting population parameters by influencing food availability and reducing survival by dislodging and killing individuals due to wave action (Combelles et al. 1986, Garc√≠a-March et al. 2007b, Hendriks et al. 2011, Coppa et al. 2013).The pen shell has been described as a successive and asynchronous hermaphrodite (i.e., male and female gametes are released sequentially in the same spawning period and the development of both sexes is not synchronous since one sex is always in a more advanced stage of development, de Gaulejac 1995, Deudero et al. 2017). However, Trigos et al. (2018) found that, in aquaria, a high percentage of the studied specimens released almost simultaneously male and female gametes. The same study suggested the possibility of internal fertilization of oocytes as a mechanism enhancing the survival of larvae. Recovery after disturbances by the reproduction of surviving individuals would be enhanced if the reproductive traits described by Trigos et al. (2018) (i.e., simultaneous gamete release and internal fertilization) are to be found as well in their natural habitat. However, Deudero et al. (2017) found that autofecundation is generally avoided, although it cannot be completely discounted.","Currently, the ongoing mass mortality event is the most worrying and widespread threat to P. nobilis throughout the Mediterranean Sea (V√°zquez-Luis et al. 2017a, Katsanevakis et al. 2019, Panarese et al. 2019, ƒåi≈æmek et al. in prep.). In early autumn 2016, a mass mortality event impacting P. nobilis was detected across a wide geographical area of the Spanish Mediterranean Sea (V√°zquez-Luis et al. 2017a). Underwater visual censuses revealed high mortality rates reaching up to 100% in the central and southernmost coasts of the Iberian Peninsula including the Balearic Islands (V√°zquez-Luis et al. 2017a). The first histological examinations already revealed the presence of a haplosporidan-like parasite within the digestive gland of affected pen shells (Darriba 2017, V√°zquez-Luis et al. 2017a), a following study described the haplosporidan parasite as a new species, Haplosporidium pinnae (Catanese et al. 2018). After its first detection, the mass mortality has rapidly spread throughout the Mediterranean Sea (V√°zquez-Luis et al. 2017a, IUCN 2018, Katsanevakis et al. 2019, Panarese et al. 2019, Cabanellas-Reboredo et al. in press, ƒåi≈æmek et al. submitted).The eastward spreading of the mortality was characterized by similar mortality rates linked to the presence of H. pinnae. Panarese et al. (2019) reported up to 100% mortality rates in three months in the Ionian Sea. While in the northern Aegean Sea (Lesvos Island) Katsanevakis et al. (2019) reported mortality rates of 93% in October 2018, however by July 2019 mortality rates were 100% everywhere along the coastline except in the inner Kalloni Gulf where mortality rates remained low (&lt;25%) (Katsanevakis et al., unpubl. data). Mass mortalities have been also reported in many Turkish sites, reaching up to 100% of mortality rates in some locations (B. √ñzt√ºrk and S. Tun√ßer pers. comm. 2019). Similar trends have been recorded in Cyprus, where only a few individuals (&lt;3-5%) in several large populations around the island were affected in 2016/2017. However, inspections in 2018 confirmed that the mortality rate was ~100% at least until 40 m depth (C. Jim√©nez&#160;and L. Hadjioannou, unpubl. data). Around the Habibas Islands (Oran, Algeria), mortality rates of 82% were reported in December 2018 (M. Benabdi unpubl. data) and since February-May 2019 the mass mortality has extended to the Adriatic Sea, with mortalities reaching 100% in many sites (Cizmek et al. submitted, H. Cizmek pers. comm. 2019) and reports along the coast of Albania (IUCN 2019).However, there are some locations within the affected zone and with characteristic environmental settings that have remained unaffected since the first outbreak of the mortality, i.e., Fangar Bay (Spain), Mar Menor (Spain), Rh√¥ne Delta (France), Etang de Thau (France), Diana and Urbino pools (Corsica), inner Kalloni Gulf (Greece) and in the Venice lagoon (Italy) (Catanese et al. 2018, Garc√≠a-March et al. submitted, S. Katsnevakis, L. Tunesi, N. Vicente pers. commm.). The reasons behind the resistance of these populations to the disease are unknown but could be closely related to the particular environmental conditions in these sites, e.g., low or high salinity conditions as occurs in the Fangar Bay or Mar Menor, respectively, and which could act as a barrier against the haplosporidan parasite (Cabanellas-Reboredo et al. 2019).In relation to these sites, it must be taken into account that some of these locations are however subjected to strong anthropogenic pressures (Garc√≠a-March et al. submitted). In fact, the Mar Menor lagoon (Spain) collapsed in spring 2016 due to eutrophication and most organisms, including P. nobilis, died at depths below 1.5 m (Garcia-Ayllon 2018, Quintana et al. 2018). Because the mortality events arrived in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and to the Adriatic more recently, further unimpacted locations maybe identified in these areas in the near future. The evidence from Alfacs Bay (Ebro Delta, Spain)&#160;suggests that the lagoons may not be shielded completely, as whilst initially Alfacs Bay showed no declines, nearly two years later&#160;the bay&#160;is partially impacted by the mortality events (Prado 2019). Elsewhere&#160;P. nobilis&#160;populations are reported to be unstable in&#160;these&#160;coastal lagoons and estuaries&#160;sites, hence&#160;the long term prospects are not good (Garc√≠a-March et al. 2019).  The results obtained by Cabanellas-Reboredo et al. (2019) strongly suggest that the parasite has probably dispersed regionally by surface currents, and that the disease expression seems to be closely related by temperatures above 13.5 ¬∫C and to a salinity range between 36.5-39.7 psu.Although H. pinnae has been identified in most sites, Carella et al. (2019) reported a mycobacterial disease as a causal agent of the P. nobilis mass mortality recorded along the Tyrrhenian coastline (Italy) in 2017-2018. However, Fanelli et al. (2018) pointed out an Haplosporidium sp. as the causal agent in very close Italian localities. It must be considered that mixed infections of these two pathogens have also been reported (ƒåi≈æmek et al. in prep.).Currently, most of the information on the extent of the MME comes from depths &lt;50 m, where the species is most abundant. The data from, at least one deep population (50-60 m) suggests that this species has also been impacted by the MME in Cyprus (C. Jim√©nez pers. comm. 2019), but in other regions the subpopulations between 50mbsl and 60mbsl have not been surveyed, although this represents a small % of the known population. Similarly data on decline rates for&#160;P. nobilis populations along the southern Mediterranean coasts is very scarce, however given the rapid spread of the parasite throughout most of the Mediterranean and the lack of any barriers to dispersal it is considered that equivalent MME's are highly likely in these regions.There are a few surviving individuals in some populations impacted by the mass mortality event: Embiez Island (France, N. Vicente pers. comm. 2019), Columbretes Islands Marine Reserve (Spain, D. Kersting pers. comm. 2019) and the Balearic Islands (Spain, M. V√°zquez-Luis pers. comm. 2019).Before the mass mortality event, according to the review by Basso et al. (2015b) the main threats to the species were described as:Climate changeWarming could affect processes potentially influenced by temperature, like reproduction and recruitment (Basso et al. 2015a, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017). Warming may induce as well a decrease in the survival rate of P. nobilis juveniles (Basso et al. 2015a). However, Basso&#160;et al.&#160;(2015b) underline that there is still limited understanding of the thermal niche of P. nobilis as well of its temperature dependence in terms of key processes, such as growth, metabolism or survival across their life cycle. Although P. nobilis juveniles have shown resistance to hypoxia interacting with warming for short exposures (Basso&#160;et al.&#160;2015c), the pen shell is a high oxygen consumer, which could cause quick depletion of oxygen for instance in shallow coastal lagoons (Basso&#160;et al.&#160;2015b). P. nobilis is likely to be particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, as it supports the fastest shell growth reported for any bivalve (Richardson&#160;et al.&#160;2004). However, the experiments conducted so far on pen shell juveniles, did not show a negative influence of ocean acidification (pCO2 levels expected for the end of the century) on the performance of juveniles of this species (Basso&#160;et al.&#160;2015a).Invasive speciesThe invasive alga Lophocladia lallemandii has been reported to alter food sources (Cabanellas-Reboredo&#160;et al.&#160;2010), antioxidant responses (Box&#160;et al.&#160;2009) and growth (Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017) in P. nobilis. The interaction of P. nobilis with invasive algae (i.e., Caulerpa cylindracea, L. lallemandii) has been reported in several locations (Cabanellas-Reboredo&#160;et al.&#160;2010, V√°zquez-Luis&#160;et al.&#160;2014, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017). Kersting and Garc√≠a-March (2017) alerted that special attention should be paid to this additional threat in front of the rapid spread experienced by these invasive algae in the Mediterranean Sea and the fact that the fan mussel is acting as a preferred substratum and could be therefore acting as a stepping stone (V√°zquez-Luis&#160;et al.2014). Attention must be paid to potential invasive predators, like the crab Callinectes sapidus, this voracious crustacean could become a threat to P. nobilis juveniles, especially in unimpacted sites (Garc√≠a-March et al. 2019). ContaminantsBioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels and an increase in the antioxidant enzymes have been detected in P. nobilis after an oil spill (Sureda et al. 2013). Also, heavy metals concentrations have been found to be high in some cases (e.g., V√°zquez-Luis et al. 2016). While it has been found that organotin paints (tributyltin) induce lamination and chambering in P. nobilis shells (Vicente et al. 2003).Habitat loss and boat anchoringPosidonia oceanica meadows, the primary habitat of P. nobilis, have experienced widespread degradation across the Mediterranean Sea (Marb√° et al. 2014). Pinna nobilis is highly vulnerable to direct anchor damage (Hendriks et al. 2013, V√°zquez-Luis et al. 2015).Food web alterationsPinna nobilis is predated mainly by Octopus vulgaris, Hexaples trunculus and Sparus aurata (e.g., Garc√≠a-March 2007a, Addis et al. 2009, Zhakama-Sraieb et al. 2011, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017) but also by sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in Cyprus, Lebanon and Turkey (M. Draman and M. Bariche pers. comm.). However, it is not clear if the turtles are preying on the epibionts on the P. nobilis shells and in consequence accidentally ingesting the bivalve. It has been hypothesized that predation pressure on P. nobilis may have increased through a cascade of food web impacts, where the dusky grouper, Epinephelus marginatus, the main predator of octopus in the Mediterranean Sea, has declined greatly due to overfishing (Basso&#160;et al.&#160;2015b). However, it has been described as well that in protected sites with well-conserved fish populations, including E. marginatus but as well S. aurata among other sparids, P. nobilis juveniles are also subjected to high predatory pressure (Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017). In this case, predatory pressure is not exerted by O. vulgaris (which is predated by the abundant E. marginatus), but by sparids and gastropods.ExploitationFurthermore, in some countries, P. nobilis is still illegally fished and even served in restaurants. In Greece, poaching by both recreational and professional fishers is an important source of mortality. In Lake Vouliagmeni (Greece), fishing mortality was much higher than natural mortality (Katsanevakis 2007) and substantially reduced the life expectancy of the species, affecting its population dynamics and limiting the potential of the population for growth (Katsanevakis 2009). It was found that Pinna nobilis was served regularly or occasionally in 16.4% of Greek seafood restaurants (in a survey of 219 restaurants) (Katsanevakis et al. 2011). Fan mussels occasionally appear in Greek fish markets, and many recipes with fan mussels still appear in the media (Katsanevakis pers. obs. 2018).","The majority of populations are in sharp decline since the outbreak of a mass mortality event starting along the Spanish coasts in early autumn 2016 (V√°zquez-Luis et al. 2017a). These events have been spread rapidly eastwards through the range (Carella et al. 2019, Katsanevakis et al. 2019, Panarese et al. 2019, ƒåi≈æmek et al. in prep.).&#160;Within a short time-scale of 18 months, the mass mortality has been reported to extend to many populations throughout the known range from the western populations in 2016/7 (Spain, France, Italy, Tunisia) into the eastern mediterranean in 2018 (Malta, Greece, Cyprus and Turkey) (IUCN 2018). In 2019 the mass mortality extended throughout the Adriatic Sea with reports along the coast of Albania and Croatia (IUCN 2019, ƒåi≈æmek et al. in prep).&#160;Initially the causes were unknown, but histological and molecular evidence pointed out to a parasite Haplosporidium pinnae as very likely responsible for the mass mortality (Catanese et al. 2018).&#160;In terms of the impact of these events, Basso et al. (2015b) noted that prior to the first mass mortality event&#160;the average population density of P. nobilis&#160;was 9.78 ¬± 2.25 ind/100 m2 (¬± SE), with maxima up to 130 ind/100 m2, but since the mass mortality events, most of the populations used to calculate those density values have now disappeared (IUCN 2019).The parasite does not impact the other species Pinna rudis, that lives in the same habitats in the western Mediterranean (Catanese et al. 2018, D. Kersting and D. Moreno pers. comm. 2019).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, where it is distributed throughout the basin, occurring from the mediolittoral zone from the low tide level (Russo 2012) to approximately 60 m depth (Butler et al. 1993).&#160;A list of the recorded localities in the Mediterranean Sea is available in the attached file.","Today this species is protected though the range in northern parts of the Mediterranean, and it was listed on the EU Species and Habitats Directive in part due to overexploitation of the populations as described below. Pinna nobilis has been a valued resource for human exploitation since early Egyptians and Roman times. The ""silk-like"" byssus threads produced by Pinna nobilis&#160;that attach the bivalve to the substrate have been used and traded for millennia to produce textiles of the highest value (Campi 2004, Maeder et al. 2004). Precious and expensive fabrics were obtained from the byssus threads which were thought to be used to decorate fabrics and clothes which were ostentatiously made, making them real status symbols valued by the most influential figures of the Babylonian, Assyrian, Phoenician, Jewish, Greek and finally Roman societies (Maeder et al. 2004). The byssus threads also had therapeutic properties well known to fishermen because, thanks to its powerful hemostatic properties, it was used for the dressing of wounds that fishermen frequently obtained with fishing tools. In the past the byssus threads were obtained fishing Pinna nobilis, but today very few people, have the skills to follow this millenary tradition, and are able to work the byssus, to produce this texture material, similar to silk, applying a method that does not harm the single specimen treated (Lavazza 2012, 2014).As a food source, P. nobilis has been of common use in traditional cooking in some Mediterranean regions and despite its currently protected status, the pen shell is still being illegally traded in Greek seafood restaurants (Katsanevakis et al. 2011) and occasionally in Cyprus in the domestic/family environment of fishermen and divers (C. Jim√©nez unpubl. data 2018). Similarly, √ñzt√ºrk et al. (2004) reported the use of the posterior adductor muscle as seafood and bait in Turkey.In Algeria P. nobilis is also traded to be used as decoration (as floor lamp or to serve seafood in restaurants) (M. Benabdi pers. obs. 2018).",Marine,"Prior to the mass mortality events across the Mediterranean, conservation actions for P. nobilis were mainly based on the protection measures applied in relation to its inclusion in lists of protected species under several national and international laws and directives (e.g., European Council Directive 92/43/EEC and ANNEX II of the SP/BD Protocol of the Barcelona Convention) and by protection of populations inside existing marine protected areas.After the onset of the mass mortality event (MME) in Spain, the Spanish authorities upgraded the status of P. nobilis&#160;in Spanish waters from ‚ÄúVulnerable‚Äù to ‚ÄúCritically Endangered‚Äù&#160;(Orden TEC/1078/2018 del Ministerio para la Transici√≥n Ecol√≥gica) and immediately started a conservation translocation to move 215 individuals from populations believed to be non-impacted into ex situ aquaria in different Spanish research institutes in response to the MME (see publication).Follow the spread of the mortality, other countries have developed action monitoring programmes to map and assess the status of the P. nobilis populations along their coasts (e.g., France, Italy and Tunisia).Conservation recommendations:1. Research on the pathogens and vectors: A deep study of the origin, epizootic dynamics and the complete lifecycle of H. pinnae is needed to find ways to mitigate the disease, gain knowledge of its longevity, and to limit its spread. Furthermore, the development of new tools for the rapid detection of the parasite (as qPCR, L√≥pez-Sanmart√≠n et al. 2019) and the combination of PCR with in situ hybridisation techniques (in development) will allow us to detect the presence of H. pinnae in other organisms that could act as vectors and/or reservoirs. As well as studies based on the transcriptomes of P. nobilis (RNA-seq), which represents a very useful technological tool in the knowledge of the factors that regulate the expression of genes of ecological and resistance to pathogens interest. Further studies are also required to clarify the pathogenicity and potential virulence of the reported mycobacteriosis.2. The natural recovery of impacted populations will depend exclusively on the ability for survival of resistant individuals and future recruitment ability. Therefore, information on this is urgently needed in order to evaluate the recovery potential of the species. Currently it is anticipated that the recovery will be low, as the number of individuals that survive are limited and the age to first reproduction is 3-4 years. It is crucial to assess the occurrence and density of resistant individuals in the impacted areas, the levels of presence and longevity of the parasite and possible presence of unknown populations in unexplored suitable deeper habitats (e.g., rhodoliths and detritic beds &gt;50 m depth, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017).3. Larval settlement and the occurrence of resistant recruits should be monitored as well in order to assess recruitment potential in the impacted areas. Currently, there is enough information on how to assess larval settlement and recruitment in P. nobilis both in the field and by means of larval collectors (e.g., Garc√≠a-March&#160;et al.&#160;2007a, Cabanellas-Reboredo&#160;et al.&#160;2009, Kersting and Garc√≠a-March 2017). Additional information on the construction and installation of P. nobilis larval collectors can be found in Kersting and Hendriks (2019).4. Increasing site and habitat protection: Given the other lesser threats, it is now imperative that we ensure the protection of any remaining survivors in areas impacted by the MME as well as ensuring protection for the species in the few locations harbouring unimpacted populations. Protection measures in these locations should include prohibition of anchoring and fishing with gears that may cause incidental mortality. Extreme care should be taken with any proposals for translocations of fan mussels from areas of high mortality (e.g., shallow waters affected by high wave intensity) to more protected sites, as whilst they may be secure increasing probabilities of survival (Katsanevakis 2016), each case must be reviewed in the context of unintentional spread of pathogens and possible stressing of the animals.5. Use of ex situ breeding and conservation translocations: In the current emergency situation throughout the Mediterranean, all restoration actions and translocations of P. nobilis must be adequately assessed before putting into practice, in order not to worsen the critical status of the species. It is feasible to obtain juveniles from larval collectors and reinstate them in the field. Kersting and Garc√≠a-March (2017) developed the methodology to grow in situ juveniles that settled previously in larval collectors and to transplant them into naturally occurring populations (where they survived over 10 yr. prior to the MME). Additionally, efforts are underway to reproduce P. nobilis in aquaria. In this sense, artificial culture of P. nobilis has been assessed by Trigos et al. (2018), testing different environmental conditions to establish the bases for the optimal rearing of the species and provide a source of individuals for restoring populations. However, these authors stated that the closure of P. nobilis biological cycle in captivity appears to be rather difficult.6. Conservation breeding: It is important to continue research on the biological cycle of P. nobilis in order to develop a selective breeding program in the event that any survivors are found within the affected areas. However, using survivors in captivity should only be done if cultured conditions are optimized in order to diminish mortality and the long-term captivity stress detected (Prado et al.&#160;2019).7.&#160;Monitoring systems: There is an urgent need to set up a regional monitoring programme ensuring information and observation exchange throughout the Mediterranean Sea. It is important to provide support in those locations lacking financial or technical support, especially those in the southern mediterranean, as well as in those locations where there are data gaps.",Palearctic,,False,False,Global & Mediterranean,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
53,North America,Obovaria haddletoni,ANIMALIA,MOLLUSCA,UNIONOIDA,BIVALVIA,UNIONIDAE,Obovaria,haddletoni,A2ac,"Obovaria haddletoni has been assessed as Critically Endangered, Possibly Extinct, as this species has apparently not been collected in over thirty years and is believed to be extinct, having lost all known locations (100% decline over three generations). However, more targeted surveys are needed to confirm the Extinct status.","This species was collected from a shoal in the West Fork Choctawhatchee River, which is a small river. There is no other information on its habitat. It is presumably a long-term brooder, gravid from late summer or autumn to the following summer. Its glochidial hosts are unknown (Williams et al. 2008).Direct life-history data is not available for this species. Freshwater mussels are highly variable in their longevity from species to species (e.g. Haag and Rypel 2011). Studies have shown longevity of Obovaria species to range from 14 to 44 years (from populations of&#160;O. jacksoniana&#160;and&#160;O. unicolor: average of 28 years;&#160;Haag and Rypel 2011). In a study of fecundity and maturity in a number of freshwater mussels, age at maturity ranged from less than one year in Lampsilis ornata to up to nine years in Quadrula asperata; unfortunately there was no estimate for representatives of the genus Obovaria (Haag and Staton 2003). Conservatively assuming a first age of maturity of between two and nine years, generation length (estimated as the average age of a parent in the population) is estimated as around 8-27 years, with three generations spanning approximately 24-81 years. As a result, we assess population decline estimates over this time period for the purpose of validation of criterion A. However, this may represent a vast underestimate of generation length, as it has been suggested that growth ring counts may underestimate age by a factor of between three and ten (Anthony et al. 2001).","Major threats to this species include siltation due to poorly conducted agricultural and silvicultural activities; chicken farm litter nutrients; proposed corps of engineers impoundment; municipal pollution; competition from Asian clam is a possibility due to its small size. Probably the main threats at present are increased logging and expanding chicken industry in the Choctawhatchee river watershed. The proposed corps dam is a potential long-term threat. The species is considered highly threatened if for no other reason than its [apparent] limited distribution (NatureServe 2010).This species is possibly highly sensitive to siltation, pollutants, habitat modifications (typical liabilities of filter-feeders); eutrophication; disappearance of host fish is a potential possibility.","This species is believed to be globally extinct (Mirarchi et al. 2004, Blalock-Herod et al. 2005). It was collected at three locations - all historic - at the type locality in the Choctowhatchee River System. Surveys of several dozen sites in the Choctawhatchee River system in Alabama and Florida did not find any specimens (Blalock-Herod et al. 2005).This species was known historically from very few specimens. It has not been collected since the type lot was taken and has not been collected in over thirty years. It is now considered to be potentially extinct (Williams et al. 2008), and given the information available we believe that this decline to possible extinction has occurred over the last three generations (36 to 60 years).",,"This species is thought to be restricted to the type locality in the Choctawhatchee River in Dale Co., Alabama (Athearn 1964, Johnson 1967, Butler 1989, Williams et al. 2008), although more recently Athearn (1998) reported to have identified specimens in his collection from the Black Warrior&#160;drainage&#160;in western central Alabama, in an area which is now inundated by a reservoir. It is potentially globally extinct (Butler 1989, Mirarchi et al. 2004, Blalock-Herod et al. 2005).",This species is not utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Williams et al.

Continuing threats of&#160;alteration and destruction of stream habitat due to impoundment of the Tennessee River and its tributaries for flood control, navigation, hydroelectric power production, and recreation are threatening the remaining subpopulations, although these at present appear stable.&#160;Further research is required regarding the taxonomy, population trends, ecology and threats impacting this species to increase knowledge of population status. Conservation measures including site and species protection through policies and legislation would be suggested to allow this species the greatest chance of long-term survival.","This species is almost always found in riffle areas with stable sand and gravel substrates in moderate to fast currents in small to medium sized rivers (Bogan and Parmalee 1983, USFWS 1983). It generally occurs in gravel substrates, usually with some interstitial sand. It is a long-term brooder, with mature glochidia by mid-September, which it broods until the following spring or summer (Ortmann 1916). In laboratory trials, poor infestation rates were obtained using glochidia removed from conglutinates during May and early June. Infestation rates improved during late June and July, after conglutinates disintegrated, suggesting that conglutinates do not serve as a host-attracting mechanism and that glochidia may not be completely mature until summer (TVA 1986). Females have been observed to display a modified mantle margin, presumably as a glochidial host attractant. During the display the female is positioned with its ventral margin oriented upward, slightly elevated above the surrounding substrate. The mantle is protruded beyond the shell margin on the posterior half of the animal. Just posterior of the midpoint, the mantle tissue from the two sides comes together to give the appearance of a small, grayish brown, bulbous knob. Movement is slight, and it is unclear as to whether this is due to muscular movement by the animal or water current (D.W. Hubbs pers. comm. 2010).Fishes reported to serve as glochidial hosts in laboratory trials include Etheostoma simoterum (Snubnose Darter) and Etheostoma zonale (Banded Darter, Percidae; TVA 1986, Watson and Neves 1998). A possible third host is Etheostoma blennioides (Greenside Darter, Percidae), but results from laboratory trials were not conclusive (TVA 1986, Williams et al. 2008).","The greatest factor contributing to this species' decline is alteration and destruction of stream habitat due to impoundment of the Tennessee River and its tributaries for flood control, navigation, hydroelectric power production, and recreation. Siltation due to strip mining, coal washing, dredging, farming, logging, and road construction is a second factor that has negatively impacted this species. Pollution caused by municipal, agricultural, and industrial waste discharges has also severely impacted this species. Recently, the introduced Asian Clam (southwestern Virginia) has been found in areas (Clinch River) where this species is found. The severity of impacts has not been measured (USFWS 1983).This species has a very narrow range with declining populations, questionable viability, and limited dispersal capability and is vulnerable to random events. It is a strict riffle dwelling species and is therefore sensitive to changes in water quality and disturbance.","There are over 125 historical occurrences for this species, but although it was once widespread, especially in Tennesse river (USFWS 1983), it was never common at any location. In Alabama, it is now extirpated but historically occurred in the Tennessee River drainage downstream to Muscle Shoals (Mirarchi 2004). A 1980 survey in Virginia reported nine occurrences. Similarly, a survey in 1980 in the lower Elk River (120 mile survey) from the Alabama border through Tennessee revealed a single, recently dead shell (tissue attached) in a muskrat midden in Lincoln Co., Tennessee (Ahlstedt 1983), &#160;live specimens were found in the Clinch River (170 mile survey) in 1979, one fresh dead specimen in 1978, nine fresh dead from muskrat middens in 1981, and two live specimens in 1982; and eight live specimens from the Powell River (102 mile survey) in 1979, 18 live specimens in 1981 (USFWS 1983). The last collection of this species in the North Fork Holston River, Virginia, is from the early 1900s, so it is likely to be extirpated there (Jones and Neves 2007).Populations in the North Fork Holston River, Nolichucky River, Tennessee River, Elk River, and Sequatchie River in Tennessee are probably now extirpated (Parmalee and Bogan 1998), as are all occurrences in Alabama (USFWS 1983).It currently occupies 10% of its historic range, occurring in only ~170 river km in the Clinch River, ~84 river km in the Powell River in Tennessee and Virginia, and ~60 river km in the Duck River in Tennessee - all of these populations are disjunct and severely fragmented with continuing decline (Jones et al. 2010). However these populations seem to be stable and should remain so as long as their habitat, water quality and ecological conditions are maintained in these rivers (Jones et al. 2010). While therefore still present in three locations, population and range declines have left the remaining subpopulations severely fragmented.Lillard Mill, Duck River was surveyed in August of 1997 and 59 males, 23 females, and 11 juveniles were found (Watson 1998). This followed a 1,000 individual transplant experiment from this same site to the following sites: Cuck River in Bedford Co.; Buffalo River in Wayne Co.; Nolichucky River in Greene Co.; and North Fork River in Hawkings Co. in 1982 (USFWS 1983) which proved largely unsuccessful.",Decreasing,"This species historically had a wide distribution including the Tennessee River and major tributary streams (USFWS 1983). Historical records are known from throughout the Tennessee River drainage, but it is believed to be absent from Cumberland River (Terwilliger 1991, Wilson and Clark 1914) despite an early report there by Rafinesque (USFWS 1983). It is currently known from the Clinch, Powell, Elk (possibly now extirpated), and Duck Rivers in Tennessee and Virginia (USFWS 1983). A disjunct population in the Duck River may be the only viable population; it is likely to be extirpated from Alabama (Mirarchi et al. 2004, Williams et al. 2008).",This species is not utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species requires protection and expansion of the existing populations and re-establishing populations into habitat that was historically occupied.This species was listed as federally endangered in the U.S. in 1976 and a recovery plan created (USFWS 1983). Objectives of the recovery plan include: (1) preserve populations and presently used habitat with emphasis on the Clinch and Powell Rivers, (2) determine feasibility of introducing the species back into rivers within its historic range and introduce where feasible, (3) conduct life history studies , (4) determine the number of individuals required to maintain a viable population, (5) investigate the necessity for habitat improvement and if feasible and desirable identify techniques and sites for improvement to include implementation, (6) develop and implement a program to monitor population levels and habitat conditions of presently established populations as well as introduced and expanding populations, (7) assess overall success of recovery program and recommend action (delist, continued protection, implement new measures, other studies, etc.).The USFWS, in cooperation with the State of Tennessee and Conservation Fisheries, Inc., proposes to reintroduce this species into its historical habitat in the free-flowing reach of the French Broad River below Douglas Dam to its confluence with the Holston River, Knox County Tennessee, and in the free-flowing reach of the Holston River below Cherokee Dam to its confluence with the French Broad River (USFWS 2006). The Pendleton Island occurrence is owned by The Nature Conservancy. Nonessessential Experimental Populations (NEPs) have been established in the Tennessee River below Wilson Dam, Colbert and Lauderdale Cos., Alabama, extending 13.4 km and including the lower 8 km of all tributaries that enter the Wilson Dam tailwaters (USFWS 2001). Nonessessential Experimental Populations (NEPs) have been proposed for reintroduction into the free-flowing reach of the French Broad River below Douglas Dam (Knox and Sevier Cos., Tennessee) to its confluence with the Holston River, Knox Co., Tennessee, and in the free-flowing reach of the Holston River below Cherokee Dam to its confluence with the French Broad River (Knox, Grainger, and Jefferson Cos., Tennessee), where this species currently does not exist (USFWS 2006).This species has been assigned a NatureServe Global Heritage Status Rank of G1 - Critically Imperilled, and State/Province Status Ranks of S1 - Critically Imperilled for Tennessee and Virginia, and SX - Presumed Extinct for Alabama (NatureServe 2009). Williams et al. (2010) list this species as endangered according to the American Fisheries Society (AFS) assessment. Further research is required regarding the taxonomy, population trends, ecology and threats impacting this species to increase knowledge of population status. Conservation measures including site and species protection through policies and legislation would be suggested to allow this species the greatest chance of long-term survival. Similarly, species management via ex situ conservation and reintroductions is recommended. Additional research is recommended for this species, specifically on its population status, ecology and the effectiveness of conservation actions.

As the generation length of the species is estimated at about 20 years, these declines are estimated to have occurred over about three generations. This represents a fraction of the admittedly narrow historic range, but these populations appear stable although historic occurrences, including all of Arkansas, have been extirpated and declines have been very large.&#160;Further research regarding taxonomy, population trends, ecology and threats impacting is required. Conservation strategies including site and species protection through the implementation of policies and legislation are suggested in order to protect this species.","This species is usually found in small sandy creeks with stable sand and gravel substrates in clear-flowing shallow water (Vidrine 1993). Shively and Vermillion (1998) found mussels on ""consolidated gravel outcroppings where streams cut into the base of a slope, or in sand substrate along the outside of bends in the stream or along logs in the streams."" Mussel density is related to water depth, substrate size, substrate compaction, and water velocity. Mussels are rare in deep, stagnant pools with silt-covered bottoms, and more common in shallow, wide areas of streams with higher current velocities and in sediments with larger particle sizes. Mussel beds are also more likely to occur in sections of the stream where the substrate was more stable through time (Johnson and Brown 2000). Mussels are more common in riffles with stable substrata such as gravel than in pools (suboptimal habitat) (Bolden and Brown 2002). Bauer (1987) estimates a generation time of about 20 years for this species.","The scattered occurrence of the Louisiana pearlshell in headwater streams suggests a historic range including most, if not all, of the Bayou Boeuf headwater systems, and that impoundments have eliminated populations in intervening areas (USFWS 1990). Kincaid Reservoir impounds the uppermost headwaters of Bayou Boeuf. Inundation by beaver dams is a significant threat to the species as well, as the species is especially sensitive to impoundments, and at least one population was eliminated due to beaver dam flooding (Matthews and Moseley 1990). Small localized populations are especially vulnerable. Habitat within the Kisatchie National Forest has been affected by sedimentation resulting from silviculture practices, road construction and maintenance, and cattle grazing under an open range policy. Sedimentation from gravel pit mining activities have also resulted in impacts to the species' habitat, particularly in the Indian Creek drainage (USFWS 1990).&#160;Where clear cuts extend to the stream bank, there is increased sedimentation from erosion and scouring of the substrate resulting from increased water velocity. Removal of the canopy may also adversely affect the habitat of this species. Due to the high visibility of this species in shallow waters where it is often evident protruding from the substrate, it is vulnerable to collection. This species only occurs in soft water oligotrophic small creeks in a small area in Louisiana and is highly intolerant of adverse impacts from poor water quality (USFWS 1990).","Vidrine (1993) reported this species to be rare from small streams in central Louisiana and included sites such as Spring Creek (Bayou Cocodrie drainage), and Catahoula Ranger District streams flowing into the southern end of the Red River. A 1998 survey of the streams in Rapides Parish found it extant at eleven streams, and a 1999 survey of the streams in Grant Parish found it extant in thirteen streams, but 95% were concentrated in four of these streams (Shively 1999, Shively and Vermillion 1998). Johnson and Brown (1998) claim the species is limited to 22 headwater streams in the Red River basin of central Louisiana. Bolden and Brown (2002) utilized specimens from Jordan Creek in the Kisatchie National Forest in central Louisiana for a translocation study.Number of individuals found at three of the streams in Rapides Parish has been high since 1985 (average estimate is over 2,000 individuals per site) (Shively and Vermillion 1998). In Grant Parish it was found in 60% of the total stream lengths searched (Shively 1999). See Shively (1999) and Shively and Vermillion (1998) for more detailed information on abundance. Most populations are found in Long Branch, Bayou Clear, Loving Creek, and Little Loving Creek (USFWS 1990). Bolden and Brown (2002) cite this species in aggregations of 20 to 40 mussels per square meter and sometimes in beds as dense as 300 per square meter.It has been reported that this species has declined by 80% over the last 25 to 50 years (K. Cummings, A. Bogan and J.

Johnson and Brown (1998) claim the species is limited to 22 headwater streams in the Red River basin of central Louisiana. Based on museum records there are indications that it may have historically occurred throughout the headwater streams of the Bayou Le Boeuf drainage (USFWS 1990). Populations in Alabama are now ascribed to Margaritifera marrianae (Johnson 1983). The species is extirpated in Arkansas.

Only one individual from a single site has been collected in the last decade, although multiple sites throughout the Suwannee River system have been surveyed for unionid mussels (Brim Box pers. obs. 2000). Previously, it was also collected from a second site, but again in very low numbers. Whether it still exists at that site is questionable. Because of this, we employ a precautionary approach, and use lower margins of extent of occurrence and area of occupancy estimates, and lower numbers of locations, for the purpose of this assessment. Further research is required regarding this species' habitat and population trends, and the threats to this species. If it is found in more locations during future surveys, this may lead to a reassessment in the Endangered category. Site protection and restoration would enable this species a degree of security.","It has been reported from mud and sand in slight to moderate current (Heard 1979, Johnson 1977), and in medium-sized creeks and rivers in muddy sand, sand and gravel, in slow to moderate current (Deyrup and Franz 1994). Like most members of the genus, it is most often found in mid-channel habitats in coarser sediments (Brim Box pers. obs. 2000).","The main threats to this species are sedimentation due to agricultural and silvicultural activities; phosphate mining (upper Suwannee River main stem); industrial pollution (pulp mill in the Withlacoochee watershed) and localized municipal pollution; fairly high density residential development; watershed development. These threats have contributed to excessive eutrophication in the Suwannee main stem and have caused declines in the population. Overharvesting by shell collectors and biologists has been a distinct possibility; in the past 20 years, 20 specimens of this threatened species have been retained for collections at the GEXEMPSITE alone. Given already stressed populations throughout most or possibly all of its range, overcollecting can potentially contribute significantly to this species' decline.The species is probably highly sensitive to runoff, sedimentation and habitat modifications; typical liabilities of filter-feeders (e.g., to excessive pollutants, eutrophication, etc.). Disappearance of host fish is a possibility.","This species is endemic to the Florida portion of the Suwannee River system, where it is known from eleven historical occurrences. It was historically known from four occurrences on the main stem of the Suwannee River, one on the Withlacoochee River, five in the Santa Fe River and one in the New River. The only recent live collections of this species are from the Santa Fe River in 1981 and the New River in 1987 and 1994. In addition, a dead shell was located at the type locality (Suwannee River, Ellaville) in 1981. It may be extirpated from the Withlacoochee River and main stem of the Suwannee River.Johnson (1977) stated it was abundant at the type locality in the Suwannee River in Florida but known from only small numbers of specimens elsewhere. Recent collections have been infrequent and few so the species has little or no viability remaining. Of the fourteen historical records located, only one contained over twenty specimens. The last site to harbour large populations yielded only three specimens in two surveys during 1987. Only one live specimen has been collected in the last decade throughout its historical range.This species is exceedingly rare and is in significant decline.

Nevertheless habitat is still there and a devastating impact of invasive species (most likely ants) is assumed.","The larval ecology and habitat are unknown. All records have come from elevations above 1,000 m elevation.

Megalagrion oceanicum has suffered greatly from invasive fish predation since the 1970s and was extirpated from most larger streams and rivers (Daigle 2000).","This damselfly occurs in swift midreach sections of rocky upland streams in mountainous terrain.Williams (1936) provided detailed notes on the ecology of this species, noting that females oviposited in the submerged trailing roots of moon flower (Ipomea alba L.), and in the stems of honohono (Commelina diffusa N.

60,North America,Pegias fabula,ANIMALIA,MOLLUSCA,UNIONOIDA,BIVALVIA,UNIONIDAE,Pegias,fabula,A2ace,"Pegias fabula has been assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion A2, as it is a declining regional endemic formerly known from 27 river systems with only very few widely disjunct populations remaining at fewer than a dozen sites. Habitat loss continues to threaten the species and some populations are no longer viable. This species has been extirpated from at least 80% of its range, experiencing severe fragmentation, inferring an 80% decline in the population over 25-50 years (J.Cordeiro pers.comm. 2011). Although the generation length is not known, the decline over 25-50 years is over 3 generation lengths using estimates from Haag and Rypel (2011). Furthermore, this species is currently considered to be declining and rare within known locations (A. Bogan pers. comm. 2010).","This is a species of creeks and small to medium rivers. Parmalee and Bogan (1998) give ‚Äúclear, cool, high-gradient streams‚Äù as its habitat. However, Bluewater Creek, Lauderdale County, Alabama, from which most of the Alabama records came, has only a moderate gradient. This species is most common at the head of riffles, but also found in and below riffles on sand and gravel substrates with scattered cobbles. It also inhabits sand pockets between rocks, cobbles and boulders, and can be found underneath large rocks (Gordon and Layzer 1989). It is restricted to small, cool streams. It is usually found lying on top or partially buried in sand and fine gravel between cobble in only 6 to 10 inches of water (Bogan and Parmalee 1983, Stansbery 1976). It remains well-buried in the substrate or under large rocks for most of the year (Ahlstedt and Saylor 1996). It is a long-term brooder, becoming gravid in September and presumably remaining gravid until the following spring or summer (Ortmann 1914, 1921). It has been observed lying exposed on the substrate surface in late September and early October in Cumberland and Tennessee River tributaries (Blankenship 1971, Starnes and Starnes 1980, Ahlstedt and Saylor 1996). This behavior is thought to be related to reproductive activities. Those reported by Ahlstedt and Saylor (1996) were gravid females, but Ahlstedt et al. (2005) reported nongravid individuals lying in a similar posture during March. Fishes reported to serve as glochidial hosts of the species include Cottus baileyi (Black Sculpin) (Cottidae); and Etheostoma baileyi (Emerald Darter) and Etheostoma blennioides (Greenside Darter) (Percidae) (Layzer and Anderson 1992, Williams et al. 2008).Little is known about the life history of this species, specifically with regard to age of maturity and longevity. However, taking into account of what is known for other mussel species (e.g., see Haag and Rypel 2011), it is more than likely that the declines observed over the past 25-50 years fall within three generation lengths for this species. Therefore, although we do not have definitive data on generation length, we believe that the dramatic declines experienced by this species in the past warrant a highly precautionary attitude to its assessment.","Deterioration of water quality, especially from acid mine drainage is the primary threat to the species. Development of coal, oil, and/or natural gas reserves in the watersheds of the Horse Lick Creek, Big South Fork Cumberland River, Little South Fork Cumberland River, Clinch River, and Cane Creek are potential threats. All populations could potentially be impacted by road construction, stream channel modifications, logging activities, agricultural activities, impoundments, land use changes, and pesticide use (Parmalee and Bogan 1998). Because all populations inhabit only short stream reaches within 1 to 5 miles of bridges and fords, they are also vulnerable to toxic spills (USFWS 1989). It is also affected by domestic pollution and impoundments (Bogan and Parmalee 1983). All populations are small and isolated, restricting genetic interchange and impeding natural dispersal capability (USFWS 1989).","In North Carolina, Bogan (2002) cites the species from the Hiwassee and Little Tennessee River basins, but it is probably nearly extirpated there. LeGrand et al. (2006) also cite it from the Little Tennessee River in North Carolina and also formerly in Valley River in Cherokee Co. Its current range is limited to Horse Lick Creek, Jackson and Rockcastle County and Big and Little South Forks of the Cumberland River, McCreary and Wayne Counties, Kentucky. In Virginia, it is found in the Clinch River (Jones et al. 2001), Tazewell County, and North Fork Holston River, Smyth and Washington Counties. A recent survey of the North Fork Holston River in Virginia (Jones and Neves 2007) did not find this species, but other surveys did in previous years, although the last live specimen has not been collected in over 10 years. In Tennessee, it is found in Cane Creek, Van Buren County (Athearn 1992, USFWS 1989). Few sites have much viability; exceptions include Horse Lick Creek and Big South Fork Cumberland River. All populations inhabit only short stream reaches within 1 to 5 miles of bridges and fords (USFWS 1989). Only 17 live mussels were found during extensive surveys in 1986. It is likely that each of the remaining half dozen or so populations, with the exception of Horse Lick Creek and Big South Fork Cumberland River, contain less than 500 individuals (USFWS 1989).TRENDS:This species has been extirpated from at least 80% of its range over the last 25 to 50 years, experiencing severe fragmentation. Furthermore, this species is currently considered to be declining and rare within known locations (A. Bogan pers. comm. 2010).",Decreasing,"Historically, this species was widespread but uncommon, known from 27 stream reaches in the Tennessee and Cumberland River systems in Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia (USFWS 1989). In Kentucky, the species was found in Rockcastle River, Laurel and Rockcastle Counties; Buck and Pitman Creeks, Pulaski County, and West Fork Red River, Todd County. Several sites are known from Virginia: South Fork Holston River, Washington County; Big Mocassin and Copper Creeks, Scott County. Historically in Tennessee, it has been collected from the Collins River in Warren Co. (Athearn 1992); the Duck River; the Elk River at Estell Spring in Franklin Co.; Cane Creek in 1967, a tributary to the Caney Fork River (Athearn 1992); and Buck Creek and the Stones River in Rutherford Co.; all part of the Cumberland River drainage (Parmalee and Bogan 1998). The species is probably extirpated from Alabama where it was historically found in Bluewater Creek, Lauderdale Co., and possibly other Tenenssee River tributaries (Mirarchi et al. 2004, USFWS 1989, Williams et al. 2008). Surveys in 1986 found this species in six short stream reaches of the Tennessee and Cumberland River basins. Over 55 potential or historic habitat areas were searched. The most recent record from Alabama was in the early 1900s. It now believed to exist in only three sites in southeastern Kentucky in the Cumberland River drainage below Cumberland Falls (Cicerello and Schuster 2003), two sites in southeastern Virginia, and one site in central Tennessee (upper Caney Fork River drainage) (USFWS 1989, Parmalee and Bogan 1998).Although the range of this species potentially still includes an area of over 40,000 km2, within this area it is confined to only a few locations (probably between 5 and 10 locations, as the species is&#160;known&#160;from around half a dozen populations; NatureServe 2009).

There is no evidence of recruitment and no live specimens found within 10 years at the single known extant site and the species continues to be impacted by major threats. Any impact on the species is significant and the species may already be extinct. Further survey work it needed to determine whether this species is still extant.,"This species is found in riffles and shoals on sandy gravel to gravel-cobble substrates and with moderate to fast currents in lotic habitat (USFWS 2000, Mirarchi et al. 2004). This species requires clean freshwater. It is known only from flowing water in medium to large rivers. The preferred substrate of P. curtum is a mixture of sand and gravel or pure sand and may be found in water less than 1 m deep.&#160;It&#160;is probably a short-term brooder, gravid in spring and summer. Its glochidial hosts are unknown, but it may utilise members of the Cyprinidae (Haag and Warren 2003, Williams et al. 2008).","The continued existence of Pleurobema curtum is dependant upon habitat in the tributaries of the Tombigbee River. The East Fork Tombigbee River is threatened by a clearing and snagging project, sand and gravel mining, the continued diversion of flows, and water removal for municipal use. Runoff of fertilisers and pesticides may adversely affect the species. Such runoff may exceed the streams' ability to assimilate, resulting in algal blooms and excesses in other aquatic vegetation. Pesticides which enter the stream are ingested by filter feeders such as P. curtum while being transported downstream (USFWS 1989). The species is nearly extinct and is considered extirpated in Alabama by construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway (Mirarchi et al. 2004).The principal cause of population decline is habitat modification for navigation. Waterway construction adversely affected this species by physical destruction during dredging, increasing sedimentation, reducing water flow, and suffocating juveniles with sediment. Deposition continues in remaining portions of the Tombigbee River that have not already been impacted severely. Water diversion is a continuing threat along with associated accumulation of sediment. Runoff of fertilisers and pesticides adversely affects mussels and leads to eutrophication (USFWS 1989).In the Mobile River basin, the greatest threats are dams (for navigation, water supply, electricity, recreation, and flood control), channelisation (causing accelerated erosion, altered depth; and loss of habitat diversity, substrate stability, and riparian canopy), dredging (for navigation or gravel mining), mining (for coal, sand, gravel, or gold) in locally concentrated areas, pollution- point source (industrial waste effluent, sewage treatment plants, carpet and fabric mills, paper mills and refineries in mainstem rivers), and pollution- nonpoint source (construction, agriculture, silviculture, urbanization)&#160;USFWS 2000). Low population levels cause increased difficulty in completing successful reproduction. When individuals become scattered, the opportunity for the female to become gravid is greatly diminished. With low population levels, any impact is a major threat (USFWS 1989). Isolated imperiled populations in the Mobile River basin are likely to be vulnerable to random accidents, such as toxic spills, and to naturally catastrophic events, such as droughts and floods, even if land use and human populations were to remain constant within isolated watersheds (USFWS 2000).","Recent populations are all but extirpated with the last holdout at East Fork of the Tombigbee River (Itawamba/Monroe Co., Mississippi) (USFWS 2000) showing no live specimens in over a decade (Hartfield pers. comm. 2003).&#160;Population numbers are extremely low and live specimens have not been reported for over a decade (USFWS 2000, Hartfield and Jones 1989, USFWS 1989, Hartfield pers. comm. 2003).The decline of the species has been over the last 25-50 years and has been hastened by the construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. Construction of the waterway has adversely impacted the species by physical destruction during dredging, increasing sedimentation, reducing water flow, and suffocating juveniles with sediment (USFWS 1989). A small population persisted until the mid-1980s in a short section of the upper Tombigbee River in Mississippi not directly modified by the waterway (Hartfield and Jones 1989) but it is believed to be extirpated as are all Alabama records (Mirarchi et al. 2004). The species is nearly extinct and is considered extirpated in Alabama by construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway (Mirarchi et al. 2004).",Decreasing,"Historically, this species was known from the Tombigbee River near Pickensville, Alabama, and the East Fork Tombigbee River downstream of its confluence with Bull Mountain Creek. Mirarchi et al. (2004) cite former distribution in Alabama as the mainstem of the Tombigbee River. A short section of the upper Tombigbee River in Mississippi (Hartfield and Jones 1989) contained a small persistent population until the mid-1980s but is now extirpated (Mirarchi et al. 2004). A single record from the Big Black River, Mississippi (Hartfield and Rummel 1985), is believed to be an error (USFWS 1989). The current range of the species appears to be limited to the East Fork Tombigbee River in Mississippi (USFWS 1989, 2000; Hartfield pers. comm. 1992) although no recent specimens were found at this single known extant site in over a decade, despite intensive surveys in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1997, 1999, and 2001 with the last dead shells collected in 1989 and 1990 (Hartfield pers. comm. 2003). It is extirpated from Alabama following construction of Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway (Mirarchi et al. 2004). It is considered historical in Mississippi in the Tombigbee River drainage (Jones et al. 2005) with the unlikely potential that a living population might be found. The extent of occurrence is believed to be &lt;100 km2&#160;(NatureServe 2009).Although specimens have not been found recently, this species may still be holding on with one or two populations but the exact area of occupancy, although very small, is not precise.",This species is not utilised.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species was listed as federally endangered in the U.S. in 1987.A recovery plan has been created for the species (and four others in the Tombigbee River) (USFWS 1989) which contains the following objectives: (1) protect the habitat where the species occurs, (2) determine habitat requirements and management needs and correct as necessary and feasible, (3) monitor existing populations at not more than 3-year intervals and recommend additional actions as needed, (4) solicit the assistance of the states, other Federal agencies, municipalities and conservation organizations in protecting the remaining habitat.A specific recovery plan has been created for the Mobile River basin (USFWS 2000) which contains the following objectives: (1) protect habitat integrity and quality of river and stream segments that currently support or could support imperiled aquatic species, (2) consider options for free-flowing river and stream mitigation strategies that give high priority to avoidance and restoration, (3) promote voluntary stewardship as a practical and economical means of reducing nonpoint pollution from private land use, (4) encourage and support community-based watershed stewardship planning and action, (5) develop and implement programs and materials to educate the public on the need and benefits of ecosystem management, and to involve them in watershed stewardship, (6) conduct basic research on endemic aquatic species and apply the results toward management and protection of aquatic communities, (7) develop and implement technology for maintaining and propagating endemic species in captivity, (8) reintroduce aquatic species into restored habitats, as appropriate, (9) monitor listed species' population levels and distribution and periodically review ecosystem management strategy, (10) coordinate ecosystem management actions (more detail in USFWS 2000).There are no known protected areas for the species.

62,North America,Pleurobema hanleyianum,ANIMALIA,MOLLUSCA,UNIONOIDA,BIVALVIA,UNIONIDAE,Pleurobema,hanleyianum,A2ac,"Pleurobema hanleyianum has been assessed as Critically Endangered under criteria A2ac, as this species has experienced declines of well over 90% of its historical range. This is estimated to translate into at least 80% reduction in range and population size since the 1950s (or three average generation lengths), to the point where it was officially declared extinct by the IUCN in 1994. However, recent rediscovery means that the Georgia pigtoe is currently only known from a few isolated shoals in the Conasauga River. This species has been extirpated from Alabama (Mirarchi et al. 2004, Mirarchi 2004) where it was endemic to the Mobile basin.","This species inhabits stretches of a medium sized river with good current and a sand/gravel substrate A substrate composed of coarse sand and gravel in stretches of rivers with good current provides the most suitable habitat (Parmalee and Bogan 1998).Pleurobema hanleyianum inhabits shoals of large creeks and small to large rivers.&#160;Pleurobema hanleyianum is believed to be a short-term brooder, gravid in spring and summer. Its glochidial hosts are unknown, but some Pleurobema species use members of the Cyprinidae (Haag and Warren 2003, Williams et al. 2008).Direct life-history data are not available for this species. Freshwater mussels are highly variable in their longevity from species to species (e.g. Haag and Rypel 2011). Studies have shown longevity of Pleurobema species to range from 19 to 45 years (from populations of&#160;P. coccineum,&#160;P. collina&#160;and&#160;P. decisum: average of 31 years;&#160;Haag and Rypel 2011). In a study of fecundity and maturity in a number of freshwater mussels, age at maturity range from less than one year in Lampsilis ornata to up to nine years in Quadrula asperata; unfortunately there was no estimate for representatives of the genus Pleurobema (Haag and Staton 2003). Conservatively assuming a first age of maturity of 2-5 years, generation length (estimated as the average age of a parent in the population) is estimated as around 11-27 years, with three generations spanning approximately 33-81 years.","Habitat loss (dams, channelization, disappearance of suitable shoal habitat, pollution) is the primary cause of this species' decline. There has been extensive impoundment of the Coosa River and its primary tributaries, and the effects of point and non-point source pollution on the surviving isolated populations. Isolated populations are vulnerable to land surface runoff that affects water quality or the suitability of aquatic habitats within a watershed. Blocked from avenues of emigration to less affected watersheds, they gradually perish if changes in land use activities cause aquatic habitat conditions to deteriorate. While the detrimental effect of any one source or land use activity may be insignificant by itself, the combined effects of land use runoff within a watershed may result in gradual and cumulative adverse impacts to isolated populations and their habitats. Excessive nutrient input from multiple sources (e.g, nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer, sewage waste, animal manure, etc.) into an aquatic system can also have negative cumulative effects (USFWS 2003).Threats are compounded by their restricted range and low numbers. This species is vulnerable to random catastrophic events (e.g., flood scour, drought, toxic spills, etc.). Limited range and low numbers also make the species vulnerable to land use changes within the Conasauga River watershed that would result in increases in non-point source pollution impacts (USFWS 2003).","Recent collections yielded a few shells from localized portions of one river and a single live individual only. There exist recent collections of a few live and fresh dead shells of this species from localized portions of the upper Conasauga River in Murray and Whitfield counties, Georgia (USFWS 2003). This species has been recently reported as a relict shell from the Conasauga River inside and adjacent to the Cherokee and Chattahoochee National Forests, Polk Co., Tennessee (Johnson et al. 2005). Williams and Hughes (1998) cite potential records for Pleurobema perovatum in the Conasauga River drainage in Georgia, but both P. Johnson and P. Hartfiled believe that Georgia records for Pleurobema perovatum actually represent another Pleurobema (probably Pleurobema hanleyianum), but a consensus has not yet been reached (J. Wisniewski pers. comm. 2007). A specimen from Chewacla Creek (Macon Co., Alabama) in the Tallapoosa River drainage (USFWS 2000, 2004) was initially identified as Pleurobema perovatum, but the specimen has subsequently been identified genetically as Pleurobema hanleyianum (D. Campbell pers. com. 2004). &#160;In 1990, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated a status survey and review of the molluscan fauna of the Mobile River Basin reported 14 species of mussels in the genus Pleurobema, including the Painted Clubshell, Georgia Pigtoe, and Alabama Clubshell, as presumed extinct in the Mobile River Basin, based on their absence from collection records, technical reports, or museum collections for a period of 20 years or more (USFWS 1994). The species was considered extinct by the IUCN (Baillie and Groombridge 1996) in 1994. Recent occurrences are only represented at 1 or 2 localities and only by a handfull of live individuals, dead, or recently dead shell material (USFWS 2003). This species is thought to have been extirpated from well over 90% of its historic range (USFWS 1999, 2003) and is now only known from a few recently dead shells (USFWS 2003) and a single live individual indicating populations are likely no longer viable or extremely small. These declines are likely to have occurred over the past 80 to 100 years (J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2012). Taking a generation length of at least 13 years (probably more like 20 years) into account, and assuming constant decline, we estimate that there has been a decline in over 80% of this species range since the 1950s-1970s. Since the species is very rare where it occurs, this is likely to translate into a similar percentage decline of the population size.",Decreasing,"This species was historically found in the Conasauga River in Tennessee and Georgia, the Coosawatee, Oostanaula, Coosa, and Etowah Rivers in Georgia, and the Coosa River and following tributaries in Alabama: Big Wills, Terrapin, Big Canoe, Yellowleaf, Waxahatchee, Talledega, and Hatchet creeks (USFWS 1999, 2003). In the Coosa River basin in Georgia, it is known historically from the Coosa, Etowah, Oostanaula, Conasauga, and Coosawattee River drainages (Williams and Hughes 1998). Until recently, the species was presumed extinct, before fresh dead shells were collected in the upper Conasauga River above Dalton, Georgia (USFWS 1999, 2003) and a single large specimen was found alive in the Conasauga River in Georgia (P. Johnson pers. comm. 2005). Williams and Hughes (1998) cite potential records for Pleurobema perovatum in the Conasauga River drainage in Georgia, but it has also been suggested that these Georgia records for Pleurobema perovatum actually represent another Pleurobema species, most likely Pleurobema hanleyianum&#160;(J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2012).

Cordeiro pers. comm. 2010); this is likely to translate into a decline of 80% in population size, particularly since the species now only occurs within a limited distribution of&#160;only two (possibly three) sites which are fragmented. Declines are not fully understood and warrant more research, particularly since the&#160;species was noted as common historically, and habitat changes have been comparatively minimal. However, point source pollution is the most likely threat to this species, and this suggests that continued&#160;declines in water quality threaten the species' survival into the future.In 1996, Bogan suggested a decline of 80% in known range (and hence populations) over the previous 3 generations (Bogan pers. comm. 1996) leading to an assessment as Critically Endangered using the A criterion.&#160; At that stage he suggested about 12 sites still exist, noting that the sites in Alabama need re-evaluation and may increase the number of known populations.&#160; Rate of finding 12 mussels per hour, with the main threats:&#160; siltation, water pollution (agricultural run-off, residential), channel alteration (dredging, road/bridge construction) and dam construction for flood control.","This burrowing mussel species is small to medium sized, attaining a maximum length of 72 mm (Williams and Butler 1994, Williams et al. 2008). This species is known from clean slow moving water parts of 'small to medium sized creeks of low gradients' and larger rivers, where the substrata is silty but sandy and stable with some 'woody debris' (Williams and Butler 1994, NatureServe 2009). It has also been found in 'claystone pockets with sand' (Mirarchi et al. 2004).Direct life-history data are not available for this species. Freshwater mussels are highly variable in their longevity from species to species (e.g. Haag and Rypel 2011). Studies have shown ages of&#160;up to 32 years for Ptychobranchus fasciolaris (Haag and Rypel 2011). Assuming a similar longevity for Ptychobranchus jonesi, and conservatively assuming age of maturity to be somewhere between 2 and 9 years (average of 5-6 years; Haag and Staton 2003), we estimate a generation length (estimated as the average age of a parent in the population) of around 17 to 21 years, with three generations spanning around 51 to 69 years. However, this is likely to represent an underestimate of generation length, as it has been suggested that growth ring counts may underestimate age by a factor of between three and ten (Anthony&#160;et al. 2001).","The threats to this species are derived from the various non-point pollution sources that arise from agricultural land, as well as increased sedimentation from any tree removals, as large sections of catchment areas for rivers where this species occurs are forested, with human population densities are currently low (Gangloff and Hartfield 2009). The Choctawhatchee River contains large ares of riparian swamps, which may further limit human encroachment on mussel habitats, reducing threats from urban run-off (Gangloff and Hartfield 2009). Speculation over the apparent decline in the mussel population may be due to a few historical milldams, as its seems that sand and silt sediments that have accumulated in former tributary impoundments may now be moving downstream to the mainstem rivers, a situation that is further exacerbated by recent droughts (Gangloff and Hartfield 2009). More studies are required to understand whether this is a threat to this species.&#160;Gravel mining is also reported to be a threat to this species (J.

By conducting more careful searches of sites in the Choctawhatchee, Escambia, and Yellow river basins where there is stable habitat and limestone outcroppings, new populations of this species could be discovered (Gangloff and Hartfield 2009).There are 23 historically known sites and only 3 current sites, one of which may not be viable (Williams et al. 2008).USFWS (2003) lists this species as having a 78-83 % decline in a number of sites and since then one more site is thought to have been lost (J.

The species is endemic to New Mexico where it is known from two springs in the Gila Wilderness totalling less than one hectare. Although the population is considered to be stable at present, one of the thermal springs in which this species occurs is used for recreational bathing, and degradation of habitat has already occurred at this spring since a pool has been excavated. Further excavations could alter the flow from the pool. In addition, across such a small area, the threat from aquifer depletion is likely to affect both springs simultaneously, so that the species occurs in a single location. At present, there is no protection from aquifer depletion for the two springs, thus making the species all the more susceptible. Further research is suggested as well as improved site protection in order to ensure that population declines do not occur.","This species is endemic to hot springs in the Gila Wilderness, Mexico, and is range-restricted by the size of suitable hot spring habitat available. This species is found in the cooler section of small, hot spring flows. It is abundant on algae-covered stones and rocks (Taylor 1987).","One of the thermal springs in which this species occurs is used for recreational bathing. A pool has already been excavated by the spring and further excavations could alter the flow from the pool.

The spring system in which this species occurs has an extent of no more than 1 acre and extirpations of subpopulations have been reported recently, indicating a declining population trend. Site protection and management is therefore vital in order to ensure the continued survival of this species.","This species occurs at an unusually high elevational habitat (8,400 feet) (Taylor 1987) in spring-rich meadows with springs and creeks of various sizes that flow into a 200 foot pond at temperatures of 15¬∞C (springs) to 17¬∞C (pond). The species is limited to the pond and spring rich meadow perched above the steep canyon of the North Fork of the East Fork of the Black River. Substrate is firm and includes cobble, gravel, woody debris, and aquatic vegetation are essential for egg-laying and grazing. Aquatic vegetation includes watercress (Nasturtium sp.), Ranunculus, and algae. Associated species in the spring include Physa gyrina, Pisidium casertanum and a few Physa insigne; and in the pond include Valvata humeralis, Physa gyrina, Radix auricularia, Gyraulus parvus, Pisidium casertanum, Pisidium compressum, and Pisidium variabilis as well as Anodonta californiensis in pools and at depths greater than 4 inches (Taylor 1987, Hershler 1994). Preliminary analysis of substrate influence on Three Forks springsnail density, based on data collected during the summer of 2001, revealed snail densities were significantly higher in gravel/cobble substrate versus sand/silt substrate, particularly when watercress was present (Martinez and Myers 2002, cited in USFWS 2003).","The greatest threat to this species is likely to be habitat loss (human created and due to trampling by livestock and crayfish burrowing). Throughout most of the 20th century, Three Forks and Boneyard Springs have been subjected to various levels of livestock grazing which degraded the aquatic environment and has been implicated in the extirpation of other hydrobiid snails. In the mid- and late 1990s livestock were fenced out of the immediate areas containing the spring complexes, although trespass livestock may occasionally gain access to springsnail sites. The degradation of spring run banks due to excessive ungulate trampling continues, however (particularly at Boneyard Springs, less so at Three Forks), and crayfish burrowing contributes to accelerated sedimentation and high turbidity resulting in changes to microhabitat conditions such as shifts in substrate composition. Habitat invasion by non-native crayfish (Orconectes virilis) contributes to unnatural predatory pressure. In May 2000, field investigations at Three Forks Springs revealed that the Three Forks springsnail is entirely absent from at least two boxed spring heads within which it was previously abundant. These extirpations coincide with the introduction of exotic crayfish into the area. Unauthorized bait bucket releases and dish washing by recreationists potentially contributes to introduction of non-native organisms and/or pollutants. Three Forks Springs has also been affected by modifications of natural spring head integrity. During the 1930s concrete boxes were constructed around four of the spring heads at the Three Forks site. However, it does not appear that these modifications have negatively affected habitat suitability for the species and springsnails have been known to be locally abundant within spring boxes and associated outflows (USFWS 2003). The species' restricted range makes it particularly vulnerable to stochastic events.","Population estimates in the last several years have concluded that the total population size is 129,135 snails (standard error = 31,511), at a density of 213.09 per m¬≤ (M.A. Martinez unpublished data, cited in USFWS 2003). The recent extirpation of two subpopulations confirms the declining population trend of the species (USFWS 2003), although population trend data is not available to accurately infer the rate of decline of the species. Martinez (2009) made three population estimates in 2002 at 129,135, 30,130 and 164,234 snails but noted they may underestimate the true population size.",Decreasing,"The species is restricted to a single spring complex from areas of the Upper Black River drainage (tributary to the Gila River) in Apache County, southeastern Arizona (Taylor 1987, Hershler 1994). Some degree of decline has been observed with extirpation confirmed from two spring sources (NatureServe 2009). The total extent of the spring complex is less than an acre (USFWS 2003, NatureServe 2009).",This species is not utilised.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is listed under NatureServe as G1 - Critically Imperilled, is listed as a Species of Special Concern by the state of Arizona and has a monitoring programme in place (USFWS 2003).

This species has been thought extinct for the past 30 years, but recently very few specimens have been found in five different basins. The general trend for Texas mussel biodiversity is decreasing, among over 180 localities examined by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in the Rio Grande River of Texas and Mexico, only 15 sites (8%) contained living mussels. While this statistic considers mussel declines overall, and not just for this species, it adds weight to the estimated declines of up to 90% declines in this species, if not more. Also,&#160;the presence of occasional individuals actually is not indicative of viable populations, since mussels usually require populations of several hundred individuals to be deemed viable.&#160;We therefore estimate a decline of more than 80% in this species over the past three generations, with the causes of decline not having ceased.","This river species has been thought extinct for the past 30 years (Randklev et al. 2012) therefore there is not much information about its habitat or ecology.&#160;It probably inhabited medium to large rivers substrates varying from mud through mixtures of sand, gravel and cobble (see Strecker 1931, Howells et al. 1996). Current habitat information is based on a single live individual found in the San Saba River (Sowards&#160;et al.&#160;2013). &#160;The river contains steep banks with extensive riparian vegetation adjacent land use of pecan orchards and rangeland. The macrohabitat is a riffle/pool sequence and the specimen was collected in a run immediately upstream of a riffle with the individual buried in very coarse gravel. Due to the small number of specimens found there is no direct information about this species' life-history, but this data might be possible to collect in the future after the discovery of a reproducing population in the Guadalupe River (Mabe and Kennedy 2013). The estimated age of other species from the same genus range from 15 to 51 years&#160;(Haag and Rypel 2011, based on F. cerina, F. cuneolus and F. ebena). In order to put population declines in perspective, we develop an estimate of longevity based on the average of the maximum ages of the species mentioned above and derive an average longevity of around 33 years (using minimum and maximum ages observed, we derive upper and lower margins of 15 and 51 years respectively). In a study of fecundity and maturity in a number of freshwater mussels, age at maturity ranged from less than one year in Lampsilis ornata to up to nine years in Quadrula asperata (Haag and Staton 2003).&#160;Assuming a first age of maturity of around five years, generation length (estimated as the average age of a parent in the population) is estimated as around 14 years, with three generations spanning approximately 42 years. As a result, we assess population decline estimates since around 1970 for the purpose of validation of criterion A. The generation length can also be estimated calculating the mean between the age of the first reproduction and the longevity which in this case would be 19 years, the span of three generations would be then 57 years. However, this may represent a vast underestimate of generation length, as it has been suggested that growth ring counts may underestimate age by a factor of between three and ten (Anthony et al. 2001).","There are no quantitative data on the impact of increasing human population on this species. The pumping of aquifer waters for direct and indirect human uses have increased. The flow of many Texas springs has been reduced or eliminated, leading to a reduction or elimination of spring feeds to streams (Howells 2010). In general, since the mid-1800s, mussel habitat has been reduced in many Texas waters by overgrazing, reduction in vegetative cover and soils, increasing numbers of scouring floods, and general increases in the amount of precipitation (Howells 2010).","This species has not been reported alive for several decades (Howells et al. 1996; Howells 1999, 2000). Two recently dead specimens were found in the central Brazos River in 2000 (FMCS annual meeting abstracts 2007), and Researchers from the Texas A&amp;M Institute of Renewable Natural Resources found a single specimen with tissue attached in the San Saba River in Texas in 2011 (Agrilife Today 2011). The only documented live individuals up until recently were from the San Marcos River (Guadalupe drainage) (Randklev et al.&#160;2012) where seven live individuals were recently collected. A single live individual was most recently recorded in the San Saba River (Sowards et al.&#160;2013). This has been the only recent evidence of this species since 1978.&#160;There are no known current living populations in the Rio Grande river basin where this species had been found in the past (Randklev et al. 2013). Before the recent discovery of some specimens the long term trend of this species' population was thought to be a decline of over 90% and in the short term between 70 and 90% (NatureServe 2009).The general trend for Texas mussel biodiversity in general is decreasing, among over 180 localities examined by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in the Rio Grande River of Texas and Mexico, only 15 sites (8%) contained living mussels and 23 (13%) had recently-dead or relatively-recently dead shells suggesting possible surviving populations in the area. However, 79% of the locations examined produced either long-dead or subfossil shells or fragments, or no trace of unionids at all.",Decreasing,"Historically, this species was known from central Texas in the Brazos, Colorado, and Guadalupe River systems; and disjunctly in the Rio Grande system in New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico (Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Taumalipas) (Johnson 1999).

It has been postulated that an extended drought in the early 1930s which is known to have drastically lowered the water levels in the already shallow Utah Lake, combined with harsh winters that caused the lake to freeze to the bottom, would probably have killed all but the hardiest of organisms living there. The early 1930s is also the time at which endemic fish and snail species became extinct in Lake Utah (K. Perez pers. comm. 2011).

In 1991, Clarke reported that populations appeared healthy, estimating a total population of three million individuals (Clarke 1991). In 2003, USFWS reported that the total occupied habitat was approximately 4.4 km¬≤, with densities of adult and juvenile individuals varying greatly. USFWS found that a few very limited areas had high concentrations of 100 individuals per m¬≤, with most concentrations of individuals being 10 or less per m¬≤ (USFWS 2003).",Decreasing,"This species was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1985 by P. Hovingh (Bauman 1990). NatureServe (2009) describe this species as being Critically Imperiled in Utah and Extirpated in Wyoming. Historically, this species lived in the freshwater Lake Bonneville, which poured off 8,000 years ago: only the Great Salt Lake and Utah Lake are left as remnants of the once gigantic lake (Bauman 1990). The species currently occupies less than one percent of its historical habitat. This species existed in Utah Lake and its adjacent springs as recently as 1933&#160;(USFWS 2003).This species is known to be extant in five spring-fed pools at three very closely associated sites north of the Great Salt Lake in Box Elder County, Utah, which are separated by sparsely vegetated playa of the Great Salt Lake over a distance of about 4.4 km (Clarke 1991, NatureServe 2009).&#160;This species has an estimated extent of occurrence of less than 20 km¬≤, and more likely nearer to 8 km2 (based on sites being found within around 4 km of each other). The area of the five spring-fed pools is likely to combine to an area of less than 10 km2 and closer to 1 km2 or less.

As a result, it currently exists within a single location, with an estimated&#160;extent&#160;of occurrence of less than 100 km2, which continues to be impacted by many threat processes&#160;including siltation, erosion and pollution from non-point sources. Monitoring of populations in the single location is required to keep check of the&#160;population&#160;numbers.The species was assessed as Critically Endangered using the B1 criterion in 1996, based on habitat loss, number of location and population decline (Bogan and Seddon, pers. copmm., 2012).","This species is found in small tributaries and streams, in less than three feet of water (Parmalee and Bogan 1998). It prefers gravel and sandy substrates in either a slow or medium current (Parmalee and Bogan 1998).This is a very small naiad, usually around 35 mm in length and is elongate and ellipitical (Parmalee and Bogan 1998).It&#160;is a long-term brooder, gravid from late summer or autumn to the following summer. Glochidia have been found to utilize Lepomis macrochirus (Bluegill) (Centrarchidae) as a host in laboratory trials (P. Johnson pers. comm. 2010, Williams et al. 2008).Direct life-history data are not available for this species. Freshwater mussels are highly variable in their longevity from species to species (e.g. Haag and Rypel 2011). Studies in other species of the genus Toxolasma have shown ages of&#160;between 5 and 11 years being recorded (Toxolasma parva, T. pullus, T. texasensis: average of 8-9 years; Haag and Rypel 2011). Assuming a similar longevity for Toxolasma cylindrellus, and conservatively assuming age of maturity to be somewhere between 2 and 9 years (average of 5-6 years; Haag and Staton 2003), we estimate a generation length (estimated as the average age of a parent in the population) of around four to ten years, with three generations spanning around 12 to 30 years. However, this is likely to represent an underestimate of generation length, as it has been suggested that growth ring counts may underestimate age by a factor of between three and ten (Anthony&#160;et al. 2001). Assuming that the declines occurred over the past 75 or so years (or between the 1940s and the 1960s, see Threats section), then declines of 90% over&#160;this&#160;time period is likely to translate into around 80% declines over three generations (assuming constant population declines). Since generation length is likely to be an underestimate, we are confident that an 80% decline in population size has occurred within three&#160;generations.","The Paint Rock River and its tributaries have been severely affected in past decades by impoundments, stream&#160;channelization, erosion, and agricultural runoff (Fobian et al. 2008). These habitat influences have led to the possible extirpation of 13 mussel and eight fish species from the river system, within the past 75 years (Fobian et al. 2008). The river has been channelized before, during the 1960s, by the U.S. Army, who also removed snags and riverbank timber in the upper Paint Rock River and the lower reaches of Larkin Fork, Estill Fork and Hurricane Creek (Fobian et al. 2008). This direct headwater habitat manipulation was probably a large contributor to freshwater mussel loss in the basin (Fobian et al. 2008).Continued threats to the watershed include siltation and erosion due primarily to poor farming practices along with commercial and residential development (Fobian et al. 2008). Threats to this species arise from non-point source agricultural runoff, direct and inadvertent impacts from pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers and chemical spills (Fobian et al. 2008).&#160;As this species has become restricted to a single river reach, it is highly susceptible to extinction (P. Johnson pers.comm. 2009).","Although the species seems viable, there is currently only one known river fork population (Fobian et al. 2008).

The lake was impounded and is still undergoing declines in size and quality due to drought and water abstraction. This species was last observed in 1993 (Hershler 2001) when the lake was surveyed, but no specimens were found since then despite two targeted surveys. There is a chance that individuals survive in the marshes at the type locality, so that further surveys are recommended. In the meantime, we flag this species as possibly extinct.","This species has been collected from a single freshwater spring - Phantom Lake, part of the Balmorhea spring system in Jeff Davis County, Texas&#160;(Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 2009).","There has been a significant decline in the freshwater flow from these springs as a result of water withdrawal for irrigation (Young et al. 1993).

Serious recent declines (since 1993) have occurred due to drought and water withdrawal. This lake was dammed and diverted in 1946 (Bureau of Reclamation) and turned from a freshwater marsh to an impounded lake.

This species would qualify under criterion B as Endangered because the extent of occurrence is less than 5000 sq km, area of occupancy is less than 500 sq km, the species occurs in only one location, and is experiencing a decline in the number of mature individuals.","This sucker inhabits Utah Lake and tributaries, in Utah. Probably it formerly occurred throughout the lake, but now it may occur mainly in shallower, more protected areas (Sigler and Sigler 1987). Utah Lake is shallow (maximum depth 4.3 meters, average depth 2.7 meters), turbid, and slightly saline (Matthews and Moseley 1990).Spawning occurs in large tributary streams (lower portion of Provo River and, at least formerly, lower Spanish Fork River), in shallower riffles over coarse gravel and cobble; water depth at spawning sites is 30-76 centimeters, water velocity 6-137 centimeters/second. Newly hatched larvae remain on the bottom for several days, move downstream immediately after swim-up (Scoppettone and Vinyard 1991).","Decline of the original population was due to pollution, drought, dewatering of habitat resulting from agricultural and domestic use of the Provo River, competition with and predation by introduced fishes, and damming of tributary streams (Miller and Smith 1981, Miller et al. 1989). Utah Lake now is operated as a reservoir, with extensively fluctuating water levels; it is increasingly eutrophic and saline, and introduced fishes (especially carp, also white bass, walleye, and black bullhead) have virtually replaced the native fauna (see Scoppettone and Vinyard 1991). These impacts have resulted in essentially no population recruitment (Belk 1998). Modde and Muirhead (1994) observed successful production of larvae in the late 1980s and concluded that recruitment failure is not due to reproductive failure.Hybridization with Catostomus ardens may have eliminated Chasmistes liorus as a distinctive species, but further study is needed.","This species is represented by one occurrence (subpopulation).As of late 1980s, the adult population was believed to number about 1,000, apparently all of them over 15 years of age, with little or no recruitment (Matthews and Moseley 1990), due to high populations of non-native predatory fishes (USFWS 1990); total population was perhaps a few thousand (see Scoppettone and Vinyard 1991). In the late 1990s, wild adult population may have been close to 300 individuals (Keleher et al. 1998, C. Keleher in Belk 1998). Most suckers captured during spawning runs in recent years have been captive-reared individuals.Abundance of unhybridized Chasmistes liorus remains to be determined.Population declined from millions in the early 1800s to fewer than 1,000 wild-spawned adults today (June Sucker Recovery Implementation Program, http://www.junesuckerrecovery.org/).

All subspecies are thought to be extirpated except for Epioblasma torulosa rangiana which is extant in short stretches of eight to ten rivers, with locations being largely disjunct, small, and peripheral.","Although this species has been collected from water to about six feet, there is little doubt that it is primarily a riffle species of sand/gravel (Ortmann 1919, Parmalee 1967, Johnson 1978, Bogan and Parmalee 1983). Like most members of the genus, it appears to require swiftly moving water, perhaps linked to high oxygen concentrations, in order to survive. This is a species of riffle areas of large rivers which have been all but eliminated by impoundment and dredging for barge canals (Stansbery 1970, 1971).Although Haag and Rypel (2010) only report a maximum age of nine years for this species, it is suspected to live for at least up to 50 years (USFWS 2012).&#160;Conservatively assuming a first age of maturity of between 2-9 years (Haag and Staton 2003), generation length (estimated as the average age of a parent in the population) is estimated as around 28 years, with three generations spanning around 84 years. Because of the long lifespan and resulting generation length of this species, it is highly likely that the majority of the observed declines have taken place within the past three generations.","Members of this genus seem to be particularly sensitive to impoundments; most species are riffle/run inhabitants and cannot tolerate other habitats. Impoundment by the Norris Reservoir of the Clinch River in Tennessee has resulted in the extirpation of the majority of species below the dam (Ahlstedt 1984). The construction of the Wilson Dam on the Tennessee River has eliminated 20 of the original 22 Cumberlandian naiad species (Stansbery 1971). Plans to impound the Duck River in Tennessee where Athearn found Epioblasma torulosa torulosa (Bogan and Parmalee 1983) have been halted (Eddlemon and Tolbert 1983). The existing populations are predominately in mountainous areas with minimal agriculture bounding the rivers. These areas are impacted by quarry washings and fly ash runoff. USFWS (1994) lists the following reasons for decline: siltation, impoundment, instream sand and gravel mining, pollutants, and invasive species.Epioblasma torulosa gubernaculum:The recovery plan (USFWS, 1984) listed the following reasons for the decline of this subspecies: impoundment (for flood control, navigation, hydroelectric power, recreation), siltation (from strip mining, coal washing, dredging, farming, logging, road construction), and pollution (municipal, agricultural, industrial).This subspecies was extremely sensitive to water quality and disturbance.Epioblasma torulosa rangiana:Members of the genus Epioblasma seem to be particularly sensitive to impoundment; most species are riffle/run inhabitants and cannot tolerate other habitats. Impoundment of the Clinch River in Tennessee by the Norris Reservoir has resulted in the extirpation of the majority of species below the dam (Ahlstedt 1984). The construction of the Wilson Dam on the Tennessee River has eliminated 20 of the original 22 Cumberlandian naiad species (Stansbery 1971). Smith (1971) ranked the causes of extirpation or declines in fish species as follows: siltation, drainage of bottomland lakes, swamps, and prairie marshes, desiccation during drought, species introductions, pollution, impoundments, and increased water temperatures. All of these factors render habitats unsuitable, cause extirpations, and lead to the isolation of populations thereby increasing their vulnerability to extirpation for many aquatic species (including mussels) throughout North America. Zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha have destroyed mussel populations in the Great Lakes and significantly reduced mussels in many of the large rivers of eastern North America and has the potential to severely threaten and other populations especially if it makes its way into smaller streams. Pollution through point (industrial and residential discharge) and non-point (siltation, herbicide and fertilizer run-off) sources is perhaps the greatest on-going threat to this species and most freshwater mussels. Lowered dissolved oxygen content and elevated ammonia levels (frequently associated with agricultural runoff and sewage discharge) have been shown to be lethal to some species of freshwater naiads (Horne and McIntosh 1979). Residential, mineral and industrial development also pose a significant threat. Destruction of habitat through stream channelization and maintenance and the construction of dams although slowed in recent years is still a threat in some areas. Impoundments reduce currents that are necessary for the most basic physiological activities such as feeding, waste removal and reproduction. In addition, reduced water flow typically results in a reduction in water oxygen levels and a settling out of suspended solids (silt, etc.), both of which are detrimental. Dredging of streams has an immediate effect on existing populations by physically removing and destroying individuals. Dredging also affects the long-term recolonization abilities by destroying much of the potential habitat, making the substrates and flow rates uniform throughout the system. Rotenone, a toxin used to kill fish in bodies of water for increased sport fishery quality, has been shown to be lethal to mussels as well (Heard 1979). Natural predators include raccoons, otter, mink, muskrats, turtles and some birds, which feed heavily upon freshwater mussels (Simpson 1899, Boepple and Coker 1912, Evermann and Clark 1918, Coker et al. 1921, Parmalee 1967, Snyder and Snyder 1969). Domestic animals such as hogs can root mussel beds to pieces (Meek and Clark 1912). Fishes, particularly catfish, Ictalurus spp. and Amierus spp. and freshwater drum, Aplodinotus grunniens also consume large numbers of unionids. USFWS (1994) lists the following reasons for decline: siltation, impoundment, instream sand and gravel mining, pollutants, and invasive species.Due to slow growth and relative immobility, establishment of sustainable, viable populations requires decades of immigration and recruitment, even where suitable habitat exists (Neves&#160;1993). Mussel recruitment is typically low and sporadic, with population stability and viability maintained by numerous slow-growing cohorts and occasional good year classes (Neves and Widlak 1987).&#160;The decline in the overall range of this species suggests that it is not tolerant of poor water quality. Individuals are sensitive to pollution, siltation, habitat perturbation, inundation, and loss of glochidial hosts.Epioblasma torulosa torulosa:This subspecies was formerly known, with few exceptions, from riffles and shoals of the largest rivers. Possibly the single greatest factor that contributed to its demise is the alteration and destruction of stream habitat due to impoundments for flood control, navigation, hydroelectric power production, and recreation. Siltation is another factor that has affected these mussels. Increased silt transport was caused by strip mining, coal washing, dredging, farming, logging, and road construction. Large river species of Epioblasma tend to be particularly sensitive to siltation, requiring clean, flowing water over stable, silt-free rubble, gravel, and sand shoals. Pollution has also impacted these mussel populations. A combination of toxic wastes, gravel dredging, and increased fertilizer and pesticide use is implicated (USFWS 1985).The decline in the overall range of this species suggests that it is not tolerant of poor water quality. Sensitive to pollution, siltation, habitat perturbation, inundation, and loss of glochidial hosts. Large river species of Epioblasma tend to be particularly sensitive to siltation, requiring clean, flowing water over stable, silt-free rubble, gravel, and sand shoals.","Epioblasma torulosa gubernaculum:This subspecies is probably extinct with the last population known from the upper Clinch River above the backwater impoundment of Norris Reservoir and the last live specimens collected in 1983 and 1984 in Scott Co., Virginia (USFWS 1984).Epioblasma torulosa rangiana:Epioblasma torulosa rangiana, the only remaining extant subspecies, was formerly widespread in the Ohio River basin (including Ohio River system in Ohio River at Cincinnati, Little Miami, Scioto, Muskingham, and Olentangy Rivers, and Big Darby Creek- a tributary of the Scioto River; Beaver River in Ohio and Pennsylvania; Lake Erie drainage in Fish Creek, and Kanawha River, West Virginia; Wabash River and tributaries-Tippecanoe River and the Eel, Blue, and White Rivers) (Parmalee and Bogan 1998) as well as having been collected historically from the Allegheny River drainage in Pennsylvania above Pittsburgh and from the West Fork River (Ortmann 1913), a tributary of the Monongahela River, Harrison Co., West Virginia (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, USFWS 1994). This subspecies now exists in eight to ten isolated populations, most of which are small and peripheral and with little signs of reproduction. It is known from the Kentucky, Licking, and Green River drainages in Kentucky (Johnson 1978), but is likely only still extant in the Upper Green. In the Maumee River drainage, it was last seen in Fish Creek (St. Joseph drainage) in Ohio and Indiana, where live individuals were very rare (Watters 1995, Grabarkiewicz and Crail 2008). It was recently found in Conewango Creek near Warren, Warren Co., Pennsylvania, where it was previously thought to be extirpated (Evans and Smith 2005). It also occurs in the Allegheny River, Pennsylvania (Jones 2004). The subspecies occurs in Muddy Creek (French Creek drainage) in the Erie NWR in Crawford Co., Pennsylvania (Mohler et al. 2006) and elsewhere in the French Creek drainage. Weathered shells are reported from the Tippecanoe River (shell only- Cummings and Berlocher 1990) and Sugar Creek (east fork White River drainage) in central Indiana (Harmon 1992) as well as throughout most central Indiana drainages. However, no living specimens are known recently (USFWS 1994) and Fisher (2006) lists it as extirpated from the Wabash drainage. As such, it is probably extirpated from the rest of Indiana except possibly the Tippecanoe drainage where it might still be hanging on (USFWS 1994). Specimens from the Black River (St. Clair drainage), Michigan, were relocated to the Detroit River in 1992 (Trdan and Hoeh 1993). It is historically known from the Clinton River drainage in Michigan (Strayer 1980). In Canada, it historically occurred in the Cedar River and currently occurs in the Sydenham River in the Northern Lake Erie drainage (Metcalfe-Smith et al. 2003) and also the Ausable River in the Eastern Lake Huron drainage (Staton et al. 2000).Epioblasma torulosa torulosa:This species is now globally extinct. This form inhabited the Tennessee River from Knox Co., Tennessee, to Muscle Shoals in northern Alabama, and downstream probably to the Ohio River and was also found in the Elk and Paint Rock Rivers in northern Alabama (Parmalee and Bogan 1998). However, it has not been reported since the Tennessee River was impounded (Mirarchi 2004). One specimen was collected in 1969 from the Kanawha River in West Virginia, but subsequent surveys revealed no other evidence of a population and no prior records are known from that river (USFWS 1985).The only populations of the northern riffleshell, Epioblasma torulosa rangiana (the only extant subspecies), with evidence of recruitment are two populations in Pennsylvania and the Sydenham River population in Ontario (Staton et al. 2000). However, due to problems obtaining a unbiased and complete sample, abundance in mussels is always difficult to estimate, and no estimates of population size or abundance have been made for this species. Epioblasma torulosa rangiana has experienced more than a 95% range reduction (USFWS 1993, 1994, Staton et al. 2000). The other two subspecies, Epioblasma torulosa gubernaculum and Epioblasma torulosa torulosa have declined to extinction (USFWS 1984, 1993, 1994). The northern riffleshell was listed as a federally endangered species in February of 1993. It was also considered to be Endangered by the freshwater mussel subcommittee of the endangered species committee of the American Fisheries Society (Williams et al. 1993). In the Midwest, the northern riffleshell was widely distributed and relatively common in some of the headwater streams in the Wabash and Ohio river drainages. It is Endangered in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, and Extirpated in Illinois. See Staton et al. (2000) for trend information.Overall, the species is thought to have undergone range declines of around 95% (NatureServe 2009).",Decreasing,"This species was historically found throughout the Tennessee River system (USFWS 1985).

Given the restricted range of this species and the threat of pollution, this equates to a single location. The species has suffered continued declines in extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, number of locations and habitat quality over the past years, and pollution from nearby Birmingham (as well as effects of impoundments of the Cahaba River and future climatic events [particularly droughts]) is likely to see this trend continue into the future unless remedied.&#160;Although this species has always been known as a Cahaba River endemic, it has declined from a short reach of river between Centreville and Lily Shoals to only one area between Centreville and Booth Ford, Shelby Co. (equating to less than 10 km2 occupancy) and is uncommon where it occurs.",This species occurs in lotic habitats in moderate to fast current over shoals (Mirarchi et al. 2004). It is also found beneath rock ledges of undercut areas (Bogan and Pierson 1993).,"This species is highly threatened throughout its restricted range due to sedimentation, siltation, and impoundments. The entire population is downstream of Birmingham, Alabama, and is therefore vulnerable to pollution.&#160;Isolated and imperiled populations are likely to be vulnerable to random accidents, such as toxic spills, and to naturally catastrophic events, such as droughts and floods, even if land use and human populations were to remain constant within isolated watersheds.","This species was identified at nine sites by Bogan and Pierson (1993). Actual occurrences may not equal the number of sites after lumping of populations. Although historically it was reported from a short reach of the Cahaba River between Centerville and Lily Shoals, Bibb Co., Alabama, today it is known to only survive between Centreville and Booth Ford, Shelby County, Alabama (Mirarchi et al. 2004). This species has never been recorded in large numbers (Stein 1976).

This species was presumed extinct (Brim Box and Williams 2000), however has been recently re-discovered (J.D. Williams pers. comm. 2010) but it is not clear if there are viable populations, and the specimens still require verification. It has potentially been found at three localities in the Flint River in Georgia, which due to uncertainty as to the taxonomic status of the find we assume (using a precautionary attitude) to equate to an extent of occurrence of less than 100 km2, an area of occupancy of less than 10 km2 and a single location, unless proven otherwise. Impoundments have previously lead to severe declines in this species and pressures on the remaining habitat are still likely to be exerted. Extensive survey work has been carried out within suitable habitat for this species, but more surveys and taxonomic verification of recent finds are required as this might lead to a downlisting of the species in the future.This species has long been thought to be extinct, as was listed as an Extinction in the early IUCN assessments.&#160; In 1996 it moved to CR, as the criteria suggested we needed more survey work to demonstrate an extinction, however following repeated surveys by Box and Williams (2000), it was moved to Extinct, as surveys failed to locate any specimens (Bogan and Seddon, pers. comm., 2012). It may still be functionally extinct, as surveys have still failed to establish whether the individuals recorded represent viable populations, however it represents a non-genuine change.","Johnson (1968) noted that Elliptio nigella was found among rocks in muddy sand, although it is not clear whether this observation was based on E. nigella, E. purpurella, or E. strigosus [= Elliptio arctata]. This species was formerly known from Coolewahee Creek, a tributary of the Flint River, at a site that is spring-fed with a substrate consisting mainly of sand and limestone rock.Direct life-history data is not available for this species. Freshwater mussels are highly variable in their longevity from species to species (e.g. Haag and Rypel 2011). Studies have shown longevity of Elliptio species to range from 14 to 57 years (from populations of&#160;E. arca,&#160;E. complanata&#160;and&#160;E. crassidens: average of 30 years;&#160;Haag and Rypel 2011). Even longer lifespans have been recorded for other species of Elliptio (e.g. 75 years, Elliptio complanata; Anthony et al. 2001). Ellipto arca was found to mature at two years of age (Haag and Staton 2003). Conservatively assuming a first age of maturity of between 2-5 years, generation length (estimated as the average age of a parent in the population, and based on lower and upper age estimates given in Haag and Rypel (2011)) is estimated as around 8-31 years, with three generations spanninng around 24 to more than 90 years. However, the lower estimates may represent a vast underestimate of generation length, as it has been suggested that growth ring counts may underestimate age by a factor of between three and ten (Anthony et al. 2001).","There are few records of this species from tributary streams, and impoundments and channel modifications in the main channels of both the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers have probably negatively impacted this species. The rarity of Elliptio nigella in museum collections has long been recognized, and may be interpreted as possible that this species had narrow habitat requirements within the range (Cordiero, pers. comm., 2012).","This species was believed to be globally extinct since 1958. In Alabama, the most recent recordings are from the mid- to late-1800s (Williams et al. 2008).The global decline to extinction was over the previous 100 years before it was recently rediscovered.On a recent survey of the Flint River basin in Muckalee creek by Colin Shea (from Martin 2009) a&#160;specimen was found. The mussel has been tentatively identified as this species, which was previously last collected in 1958. Researchers however, are not ready to claim discovery just yet.&#160; Several weeks later, what appeared to be more mussels of the same species were found at two additional localities on the Flint River (Martin 2009). Although all of the specimens look similar, their true identity remains uncertain because they are easily confused with other species. Complicating identification further is that researchers examined 42 lots at the Florida Museum of Natural History identified as the Winged Spike and concluded that only 11 were identified accurately, leaving them cautiously hopeful that they have found the Winged Spike (Martin 2009).",Decreasing,"This species is an Apalachicola river system endemic with historical occurrences in the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers in Alabama and Georgia.  There is very little information known about the historical abundance of this species (Brim Box and Williams 2000). Johnson (1968) noted that of the thousands of unionid mussels collected by Clench, Turner, and McMichael during the summer of 1954, only three specimens were Elliptio nigella (Johnson 1968). Historically, it is known from 17 collections made from eight occurrences. Although Simpson (1914) reported this species from ""Chattahoochee River; south into Florida,"" he gave no basis for the Florida records and there are no known records of Elliptio nigella from Florida (Brim Box and Williams 2000). It once occurred in the main channel of the lower and middle Flint River and in the Chattahoochee River in Muscogee County, Georgia, and possibly Henry County, Alabama. The type locality was mistakenly published as Columbus, Georgia (Johnson 1968), but this is an error for Columbia, Alabama (Williams et al. 2008).In a survey of 324 sites throughout its historical range no specimens were found (Brim Box and Williams 2000) and it was thought to be extinct (Williams et al. 2008). However, it is now thought to be extant in the Flint River (J.D. Williams pers. comm. 2010) after recent finds of what most likely is this species (Martin 2009). Estimation of extent of occurrence is highly uncertain, based on the imprecise current knowledge of its occurrence. It may be less than 100 km2, particularly taking into account that the species was previously thought to be extinct and recent collections still require verification. Similarly, using a conservative approach, we assume that the three localities in the Flint River, Georgia, in which the species is likely to have been recently rediscovered, combine to make up a single location.",This species is not utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"There are no species-specific&#160;conservation measures in place for this species.

89,North America,Alasmidonta raveneliana,ANIMALIA,MOLLUSCA,UNIONOIDA,BIVALVIA,UNIONIDAE,Alasmidonta,raveneliana,A2ac,"Alasmidonta raveneliana is assessed as Critically Endangered. Although there has been documented expansion of one population and discoveries of additional (though likely non-viable) populations of the species since it was listed as Critically Endangered in 2000, the species continues to have a very fragmented relict distribution. Its extent of occurrence is estimated as less than 1,000 km2 and the area of occupancy is likely to be less than 100 km2. There is limited suitable habitat available for this species and what remains is disjointed. All of the surviving populations continue to be threatened by many of the same factors identified at the time of the previous listing. Of the seven surviving populations, five are restricted to scattered pockets of suitable habitat and their genetic viability is of concern. Two of the populations, previously considered the healthiest of the surviving populations, appear to have declined in recent years, and an overall decline in populations of 80% has been documented over the past 20-35 years. With a generation length of between 10-25 years, this decline falls well within three generation lengths (30-75 years) for this species.","This species inhabits streams anad rivers where it is found in sand and gravel substrate among cobbles and boulders and under flat rocks, usually in moderate current at depths of less than 1 m (Parmalee and Bogan 1998). Suitable habitat in the majority of streams where the species survives is limited. The majority of the surviving populations are comprised of scattered occurrences of the species, restricted to pockets or short reaches of suitable habitat (USFWS 2009). The generation length of the species is likely to be between 10 and 25 years (M. Seddon pers. comm. 2012).The fish hosts for this species are the Banded Sculpin (Cottus carolinae) and the Mottled Sculpin (Cottus bairdi) (USFWS 2009).","The USFWS (2009) identifies the following factors as leading to the loss and decline of this species throughout its historic range. These include: habitat loss and alteration associated with impoundments, channelization, mining, and dredging operations; pollutants in wastewater discharges (sewage treatment plants and industrial discharges); runoff of silt, fertilizers, pesticides, and other pollutants from land disturbance activities implemented without adequate measures to control erosion and storm water runoff. Many of these same factors continue to threaten the surviving populations of the species.The species appears to have been eliminated from most of the Cane River as a result of problems associated with wastewater discharge. A die-off of unknown cause in the Little Tennessee River appears to be continuing and spreading upstream. Ongoing (since summer 2007) exceptional drought conditions are becoming an increasing threat (especially lack of dilution of pollutants in wastewater treatment plant discharges, increasing accumulations of sediment from lack of flushing flows and elevated water temperature) (USFWS 2009).The Nolichucky River system population, Little Tennessee River population and Tuckasegee River population are sufficiently widely distributed that it is unlikely that a single event would eliminate one or more of them. However, the Cheoah River, Pigeon River, Little River, and Mills River populations are restricted to scattered areas of suitable habitat in much shorter stream reaches making them vulnerable to extirpation from a single catastrophic event, such as a major chemical spill (USFWS 2009).The genetic viability of the surviving populations remains a concern. All of the remaining populations of this species appear to be effectively isolated from one another by impoundments and several of these populations may be below the level required to maintain long-term genetic viability (USFWS 2009).","Since its listing as Critically Endangered in 2000, additional populations of this species have been discovered, but all with very low number of individuals: two individuals have been found recently in the North Toe River, Yancey and Mitchell Cos., North Carolina, below the confluence of Crabtree Creek, and 15 live individuals, with no more than two to three at each site and one shell, recorded from the South Toe River, Yancey Co., North Carolina (USFWS 2002).Overall, the currently known populations of this species are only remnants within this species‚Äô historical range and exist as fragmented and separate entities. All of the surviving populations are separated from one another by major impoundments and/or apparently unsuitable habitat (USFWS 2009). The species survives only in small portions of the Little Tennessee River system, Pigeon River system, and little River in North Carolina and the Nolichucky River system in North Carolina and Tennessee (USFWS 2002).In 2000, a decline of 80% in populations of this species had been observed over the last 10-25 years (Bogan 2000), which led to an assessment of Critically Endangered. Of the seven known surviving populations of this species, the Nolichucky River system population and the Tuckasegee River population currently appear to be viable. The other five populations of this species currently appear to be comprised of scattered individuals restricted to very short stream reaches, and their viability is presently questionable (USFWS 2009).Severe floods in 2004 adversely affected population levels, and in some cases the range, of all of the surviving populations. A major decline of this species was documented to be occurring in the Little Tennessee River in 2005 and appears to be continuing (this population appears to have been reduced by at least 70-80%) (USFWS 2009). The Cane River portion of the Nolichucky River system population appears to have been all but eliminated, apparently due primarily to the discharge of pollutants from the Burnsville Wastewater Treatment Plant (Fridell pers. observ. 2008, in USFWS 2009).Evidence of recent reproduction has been documented in all of the surviving populations, with the exception of the Cheoah River population. Some of the fish hosts for this species have been documented in all areas of currently occupied habitat (USFWS 2009).",Decreasing,"This species is restricted to the French Broad and Little Tennessee River drainages, tributaries of the Tennessee River in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina (Parmalee and Bogan 1998). These two main populations are distinct and represent two separate and distinct conservation units (Bogan et al. 2008).&#160;Additional populations of this species have been recently discovered, but all with a very low number of individuals.&#160;The extent of occurrence of this species is estimated between 250 and 1,000 km2, with an area of occupancy of no more than 100 km2.",This species is not utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species has been given a NatureServe Global Heritage Status Rank of G1 - Critically Imperiled (NatureServe 2009), was assigned an American Fisheries Society Status of Endangered (1 Jan 1993), and a previous IUCN Red List Category of Critically Endangered (2000 ver 2.3) (Bogan 2000). This species was assigned a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Lead Region of R4 ‚Äì Southeast. The USFWS listed this species as Endangered in 1994, implemented a recovery plan for the species in 1996, and designated Critical Habitat for the species in 2002. The USFWS Species Recovery Plan Five Year Review (2009) documents that although some of the recovery plan criteria have been met, further improvements need to occur before the species can change from a USFWS listing of Endangered to Threatened. This species is represented by two separate conservation units corresponding to the French Broad and Little Tennessee River drainages (Bogan et al. 2008).This species is listed as endangered by both the states of North Carolina and Tennessee. Though this designation prohibits the collection of the species without a valid state collecting permit, it does not provide any protection to the species from other forms of take, or offer any regulatory protection to its habitat (USFWS 2009). The USFWS have pledged to continue working to address threats and improve the status of the species in the streams where it occurs (USFWS 2009). However, the majority of the surviving populations of this species continue to face significant threats associated with development activities, agriculture operations, wastewater discharges, storm water runoff and non-point source pollutants (NatureServe 2009).Many of the activities that pose a significant threat to the surviving populations of the species and its habitat are not subject to the regulations of section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (i.e., they do not have any federal involvement: no federal permits, authorization, or funding associated with the activity; and therefore no requirement for consultation with the Service if they may adversely affect federally-listed species) (USFWS 2009).There are plans in place to remove the small hydroelectric Dillsboro Dam on the Tuckasegee River, and detailed monitoring of the habitat conditions will be part of the dam removal plan (USFWS 2009).Experiments by North Carolina State University in collaboration with North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission has shown some progress in captive propagation and culture with closely related Alasmidonta varicosa and Alasmidonta viridis (USFWS 2009), and this may play a part in future conservation of this species.Further monitoring of the existing populations is recommended to determine long term viability and and research into the effects of ongoing threat processes is needed. Effective habitat and site protection is needed to safeguard the species from pollution, siltation and other threats, and policy and law needs to incorporate the habitat needs of the species for effective conservation.",Nearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

The last collection of the species was made in 1974 from a portion of the Coosa River drainage in Alabama and Georgia. Surveys in 1990 and 1991 failed to relocate the species, but potentially suitable habitat is still available in the upper Coosa River drainage. Historically, this species was known from the upper Coosa River system and the Cahaba River above the fall line in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee, but has not been reported in many years.",The only available habitat information appears to be in van der Schalie (1938). He lists specimens he questionably called this species from Lily Shoals of the Cahaba River. Species of this genus typically were found in strong currents and coarse particle substrates.,"The species is threatened by habitat modification, sedimentation, and other forms of water quality degradation. Potential habitat is locally impacted by carpet mill and other industrial discharge, sewage treatment plant discharge, urban and agricultural runoff, and surface mine drainage (USFWS 1997). Disappearance from significant portions of its range are primarily due to changes in river and stream channels due to dams, dredging, or mining, and historic or episodic pollution events. The species is not known to survive in impounded waters and more than 1700 km of large and small river habitat in the basin have been impounded by dams for navigation, flood control, water supply, and/or hydroelectric production purposes (USFWS 2004).In the Mobile River basin, the greatest threats are dams (for navigation, water supply, electricity, recreation, and flood control), channelisation (causing accelerated erosion, altered depth, loss of habitat diversity, substrate stability, and riparian canopy), dredging (for navigation or gravel mining), mining (for coal, sand, gravel, or gold) in locally concentrated areas, point source pollution (industrial waste effluent, sewage treatment plants, carpet and fabric mills, paper mills and refineries in mainstem rivers), and non-point source pollution (construction, agriculture, silviculture, urbanisation) (USFWS 2000). Isolated imperiled populations in the Mobile River basin are likely to be vulnerable to random accidents, such as toxic spills, and to naturally catastrophic events, such as droughts and floods, even if land use and human populations were to remain constant within isolated watersheds (USFWS 2000). This species does not tolerate impoundments.","Historically, Epioblasma othcaloogensis was found in streams of the Coosa River system and Conasauga River of Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee. However, when it was last collected in 1974, it was only found within a small portion of the Upper Coosa River drainage in Georgia and Alabama. If the species is still extant, it is likely to occur in fewer than five occurrences, but in all likelihood this species is extinct. The most recent records were from tributaries of the Coosa River (above Weiss Dam in Alabama) in the early 1970s, and the Cahaba in the 1930s (USFWS 2004, Mirarchi et al. 2004). The Cahaba River specimen is questionable, at best (Williams et al. 2008). The most recent documentation of museum specimens were taken in 1973 from the Conasauga River, Georgia, and Little Canoe Creek on the Etowah and St. Clair County line, Alabama (Williams et al. 2008). Potentially suitable habitat can still be found in several rivers and streams of the upper Coosa River drainage, but it has not been found in the Cahaba River drainage in several decades.There have been no recent occurrences despite repeated searches over the last ten years. However, the range is large, so that there is a chance that the species may still be extant; plus individuals are small and difficult to find as they bury completely in the substrate (USFWS 2004).",Decreasing,"Historically, this species was known from the upper Coosa River system and the Cahaba River above the fall line in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee, but has not been reported in over twenty years years and may be extinct (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, Mirarchi et al. 2004, USFWS 2004, Williams et al. 2008). In Tennessee, it has not been reported in many years and was only known from the Conasauga River in Polk Co. (Parmalee and Bogan 1998). In the Coosa River basin in Georgia, it is known historically from the Etowah, Oostanaula, and Conasauga River drainages but has not been collected live recently (Williams and Hughes 1998).Only one record of this species outside of the Coosa River drainage is known (University of Michigan, Museum of Zoology Collection - No. 91261). It was labeled ‚ÄúCahaba River, Alabama‚Äù, with no accompanying data. This record is questionable, since the Cahaba River was well-sampled during the early 1900s and no other specimens are known. Therefore this species is not considered to be part of the Cahaba River fauna (Williams et al. 2008). The most recent documented museum collections of this species were taken in 1973 from the Conasauga River, Georgia, and Little Canoe Creek, on the Etowah and St. Clair county line, Alabama.On current knowledge, the species has an estimated extent of occurrence of less than 100 km2 and an area of occupancy of less than 10 km2 (probably significantly less for both).&#160;If it is still extant, there are likely to be fewer than five occurrences, but in all likelihood, this species is extinct (NatureServe 2009).",This species is not utilised.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species was listed as federally endangered in the U.S. in 1992 and a recovery plan was prepared (USFWS 2000).

Similarly, the species has been assigned a NatureServe Global Heritage Status Rank of GH - Possibly Extinct, and State/Province Status Ranks of SH - Possibly Extinct in Tennessee, and SX - Extinct in Alabama, and Georgia (NatureServe 2009).A specific recovery plan has been created for the Mobile River basin (USFWS, 2000) which contains the following objectives: (1) protect habitat integrity and quality of river and stream segments that currently support or could support imperiled aquatic species, (2) consider options for free-flowing river and stream mitigation strategies that give high priority to avoidance and restoration, (3) promote voluntary stewardship as a practical and economical means of reducing nonpoint pollution from private land use, (4) encourage and support community based watershed stewardship planning and action, (5) develop and implement programs and materials to educate the public on the need and benefits of ecosystem management, and to involve them in watershed stewardship, (6) conduct basic research on endemic aquatic species and apply the results toward management and protection of aquatic communities, (7) develop and implement technology for maintaining and propagating endemic species in captivity, (8) reintroduce aquatic species into restored habitats, as appropriate, (9) monitor listed species population levels and distributions and periodically review ecosystem management strategy, (10) coordinate ecosystem management actions (more detail in USFWS 2000).Critical habitat has been designated in Alabama in the Cahaba River, Coosa River, Hatchet Creek, Kelly Creek, Big Canoe Creek, and the lower Coosa River; in Georgia in Oostanaula complex; and in Tennessee in Oostanaula complex (0 occupied, 549 unoccupied km) (USFWS 2004).Further surveys are needed to determine whether this species is still extant.

The limited range of this species is becoming even more restricted (down to only five rivers, two of which may no longer be viable) due to changes in water quality from pollution and impoundments. Range declines have been significant (80%), and are likely to equate to at least 80% population reductions. Although the generation length is not known, the decline over 25-50 years is over 3 generation lengths using estimates from Haag and Rypel (2011). In addition, declines of around 80% in some parts of the species range have occurred since about 1999, thus estimated to be about 70% over a timeframe of 10 years (see Jones and Neves 2007, Hanlon et al. 2009, Eckert &amp; Pinder 2008, Eckert et al. 2010). Surviving populations are isolated from one another. Further research and the implementation of conservation strategies are required in order to ensure this species' survival.","This species is found in shoals and riffles of small to medium sized rivers in clear streams with moderate to fast current (Bogan and Parmalee 1983). It is typically well burrowed in sand and cobble substrates. It does not appear tolerant of deeper water or reservoirs (USFWS 1984).This species is a short-term brooder. Ortmann (1921) reported gravid females from mid-May to mid-July. However, he stated that ‚Äúnone happened to have glochidia.‚Äù Presumably they were gravid with eggs or developing embryos. Females gravid with mature glochidia have been reported in July and August (Jones and Neves 2007) and glochidia have been reported in stream drift in the North Fork Holston River, southwestern Virginia, during the same period (Kitchel 1985) (Williams et al. 2008).Cyprinella galactura (Whitetail Shiner, Cyprinidae) was found to serve as a glochidial host of the species in laboratory trials (Neves 1991). Fishes found to be marginal hosts in laboratory trials include Luxilus chrysocephalus (Striped Shiner) and Luxilus coccogenis (Warpaint Shiner, Cyprinidae); and Etheostoma rufilineatum (Redline Darter, Percidae; Jones and Neves 2001). Fishes in the North Fork Holston River for which observations of natural infestation with this species' glochidia have been reported include Luxilus cornutus (Common Shiner) and Notropis telescopus (Telescope Shiner, Cyprinidae; Kitchel 1985, Williams et al. 2008).","This species is sensitive to changing water quality and physical disruption. It is therefore threatened by habitat alteration and pollution from strip mine runoff and coal washing. Intensive industrial and agricultural development of the Tennessee Valley since the early 1900s has had a significant impact upon the mussel fauna inhabiting the Tennessee River basin. Dam construction in the upper Tennessee River system may have been the most significant factor. Dams were constructed for hydroelectric power, flood control, and navigation, as well as recreation. Siltation has also impacted the species (from strip mining, coal mining, road construction, forestry and agricultural operations). Pollution is also a factor, from heavy metals, industrial effluent, chemical spills, agricultural waste, fertilizers, pesticides, and human waste (USFWS 1984). Populations in the North Fork of Holston and Clinch rivers were reduced by toxic discharges and spills prior to 1972. Some sizable populations in the Elk River were destroyed by impoundment of Tims Ford Reservoir. The invasion of the Asian clam, and the possible invasion of the zebra mussel, also threaten remaining populations.","A 1980 survey for Virginia Game and Inland Fisheries put the number of sites in Virginia at 30 (Neves 1991), about half of which are considered historical or extirpated (the species is likely to be still extant in Virginia in Powell, Upper Clinch, North and South Fork Holston); populations of the mussel are disjunct throughout its range. No comprehensive surveys have been conducted throughout its range, however, it remains as a relict population in many stretches of the Clinch, including Copper Creek (Fraley and Ahlstedt 2000, Jones et al. 2001) and Powell Rivers in Tennessee and Virginia, and in the Paint Rock River in northern Alabama, particularly the unimpounded sections (Parmalee and Bogan 1998). Jones and Neves (2007) summarize the distribution in the upper North Fork Holston River (Smyth and Bland Cos., Virginia) as river km 136.2 to 154.3. Since 1970, the species has been taken from several tributaries of the Tennessee River including the North Fork Holston River, Clinch River, Powell River, Elk River, and Paint Rock River (USFWS 1984, 2006). A 210 km survey of the Elk River from the Alabama border through Tennessee in 1980 found this species at a few sites in Lincoln/Moore Cos., Tennessee (Ahlstedt 1983). In Tennessee, it once occurred in the Clinch River, from Hancock Co. downstream to Roane Co., and in the Powell River, from Hancock Co. downstream to Campbell Co.. However, it is now restricted to unimpounded stretches of these rivers in Claiborne and Hancock Cos. (Parmalee and Bogan 1998). In Alabama, it was once distributed across the northern part of the state, but now is only extant in the Paint Rock River (Mirarchi et al. 2004).The species is now believed to be extirpated in the Tennessee, Holston, and Elk Rivers in Tennessee (Parmalee and Bogan 1998). It is also believed to be extirpated in the Flint River (USFWS 1984) and Tennessee River proper in Alabama (Mirarchi et al. 2004). The species was once common throughout much of the Tennessee River, but was never recorded from the Duck or Cumberland Rivers (USFWS 1984). This species has lost at least 80% of its known range over the last 25 to 50 years (A. Bogan pers. comm.&#160;2010).A few sites in Virginia have the best viability, as does the population in the Clinch River on the Tennessee side (considered the most viable extant population). Sites with recent recruitment exists in the North Fork Holston River above Saltville, Virginia; Clinch River in Tennessee to Russell Co., Virginia; Powell River from Norris Reservoir upstrream to Lee Co., Virginia/ Elk River in Lincoln Co., Tennessee; Paint Rock River in Jackson Co., Alabama; and Copper Creek in Scott Co., Virginia (USFWS 1984).Jones and Neves (2007) recorded a die-off in the North Fork Holston River in Virginia beginning in 1999. Hanlon et al. (2009) showed similar declines in Copper Creek, Virginia,&#160;Eckert&#160;et al. (2010) on Cleveland Island on the Clinch River, and Eckert &amp; Pinder (2008) in Clinchport on the Clinch River.",Decreasing,"Historically, this species occurred throughout the Tennessee River drainage as far south as Mussel Shoals, including sections of the Elk, Flint, Paint Rock, Clinch, Powell, North Fork Holston, and Tennessee Rivers (USFWS 1984). Its current distribution is scattered over five rivers: the North Fork of the Holston in Virginia, the Clinch (from the Virginia-Tennessee border upstream to Nash Ford), the Powell (from the Virginia-Tennessee border upstream to Lee County, Tennessee), the Elk River in Tennessee (although it has not been seen here since 1980) and the Paint Rock River in Alabama, where it is uncommon (Mirarchi et al. 2004, USFWS 1984).Its current distribution is scattered over five rivers (assessed as five locations) and the limited range of this species is becoming even more restricted (two of the rivers may no longer be viable) due to changes in water quality. The extent of occurrence is estimated as no more than 5,000 km2. Declines have been significant (80% of range) and existing populations are isolated from one another.",This species is not utilised.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species was listed as federally endangered in 1976 in the U.S., and a recovery plan was created (USFWS 1984) and an experimental reintroduced population established (USFWS 2001, 2006). Williams et al. (2010) lists this species as Endangered according to the AFS assessment. The species has also been assigned a NatureServe Global Heritage Status Rank of G1 - Critically Imperilled, as well as State/Province Status Ranks of S1 - Critically Imperilled for the states of Alabama, Tennessee and Virginia (NatureServe 2009).Pendleton Island in the Clinch River is a TNC preserve. Nonessessential Experimental Populations (NEPs) have been established in the Tennessee River below Wilson Dam, Colbert and Lauderdale Cos., Alabama, extending13.4 km and including the lower 8 km of all tributaries that enter the Wilson Dam tailwaters (USFWS 2001). Nonessential Experimental Populations (NEPs) have been proposed for reintroduction into the free-flowing reach of the French Broad River below Douglas Dam (Knox and Sevier Cos., Tennessee) to its confluence with the Holston River, Knox Co., Tennessee, and in the free-flowing reach of the Holston River below Cherokee Dam to its confluence with the French Broad River (Knox, Grainger, and Jefferson Cos., Tennessee), where this species currently does not exist (USFWS 2006).Further research regarding this species' taxonomy, ecology, population status and threats impacting this species is recommended. Conservation measures are needed in order to ensure this species' long-term survival, including site and species protection (with particular emphasis on the enforcement of protection), and a&#160;continuation&#160;of current management and population augmentation methods.",Nearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

The occurrence of this species has been restricted by 90% leaving less than 32 linear km of occupied habitat. This habitat is patchy and continues to decline under the impact of many threats. The one extant population exists in a short reach of stream in 15 shoals half of which appear to be declining.","This species requires shallow flowing water over gravel, cobble, or bedrock in the strong currents of rapids and shoals (Hartfield 1994, USFWS 2000, 2005).","The main threat to this species is habitat modification. A proposed impoundment within the reach of habitat for the existing population would bisect the current known range (USFWS 1995). Other impacts which threaten this species include channel modification, agriculture, silviculture, cattle grazing, mining, drainage from unpaved roads, industrial and residential development (Bogan and Pierson 1993). Curtailment of habitat and range in the Mobile River Basin's larger rivers (Coosa, Alabama, Tombigbee and Black Warrior) due to extensive construction of dams and inundation of the snails shoal habitats by impounded waters (snails have disappeared from all portions of historic habitats that have been impounded by dams). Short and long-term impacts of point and non-point source water and habitat degradation continue to be a primary concern, compounded by population isolation and localization (USFWS 2004, 2005).In the Mobile River basin, the greatest threats are dams (navigation, water supply, electricity, recreation, and flood control), channelization (causing accelerated erosion, altered depth, and loss of habitat diversity, substrate stability, and riparian canopy), dredging (for navigation or gravel mining), mining (for coal, sand, gravel and gold) in locally concentrated areas, pollution-point source (industrial waste effluent, sewage treatment&#160; (USFWS 2000).","Extensive surveys have located only one population. Historically, there were many more (Hartfield 1994, USFWS 2005). The current population consists of subpopulations on fifteen shoals in 30 km reach of Locs Fork (Black Warrior drainage), Jefferson County, between Kimberly and Sayre (Mirarchi et al. 2004, USFWS 2000, 2004, 2005). There are less than three shoals with a high density of snails.It appears to be declining in the Locust Fork of the Black Warrior River where it recently occurred in about an 88 km stretch, but now exists in about a 32 km reach (USFWS 2005). Biologists conducting recent surveys have noted the disappearance of the species from one reach of stream since the work began on the species (P. Hartfield pers. comm. 1996). A 50% reduction in range has occurred in the last decade.Decline since the early 20th century is documented as the species has disappeared from over 90% of its historic range where it formerly occurred in the Black Warrior River, Little Warrior River and Tombigbee River (USFWS 2004, 2005).",Decreasing,"In the past, this species has been reported by Goodrich (1938, 1941) from forks of the Black Warrior River, Walker County, the Black Warrior River in Jefferson County (including Valley Creek, Burch 1989) and at Tuscaloosa Co.; the Little Black Warrior River and the Tombigbee River (Stein 1976).The current range of the species is limited to a short reach of the Locust Fork of the Black Warrior River in Jefferson and Blount Counties, Alabama (Hartfield 1994, USFWS 1995, 2000, 2004, 2005). Recent status surveys have located Plicate Rocksnail populations only in an approximately 88 km (55 mile) reach of the Locust Fork of the Black Warrior River, Jefferson and Blount counties, Alabama (USFWS 2005). The latest survey information indicates that the snail has recently disappeared from the upstream two-thirds portion of that habitat and now appears to be restricted to an approximately 32 km (20 mile) reach in Jefferson County (USFWS 2005). As such the current extent of occurrence falls well within the Critically Endangered category threshold.Three subpopulations can be considered as one location, due to the threat of pollution and impoundment potentially severely impacting the entire location.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The short reach of the Locust Fork where this species still persists is surrounded by private lands (Hartfield 1994). A captive breeding population has been established at the Southeast Aquatic Research Institute but breeding in captivity has not been successful (USFWS 2000). An ongoing captive propagation program started at the Tennessee Aquarium Research Institute should continue. Augmentation of the population in Locust Fork, using propagated juveniles, began in 2003 and continues. Reintroductions elsewhere should be considered where suitable habitat is found (Mirarchi et al. 2004).This species was listed as federally endangered in the U.S. in 1998 (USFWS 1998). A recovery plan was drafted with the objective to delist the species (USFWS 2005):Recovery Criteria:Reclassification of the Cylindrical Lioplax (Lioplax cyclostomaformis), Flat Pebblesnail (Lepyriam showalteri) and Plicate Rocksnail (Leptoxis ampla); and the Painted Rocksnail (Leptoxis taeniata), Round Rocksnail (Leptoxis ampla), and Lacy Elimia (Elimia crenatella) will require confirmation of stability or increase in their existing populations for 10 or more years, establishment of captive populations, and identification or establishment of at least two additional populations for each species. Delisting of all six species will require the confirmation of at least three stable or increasing populations for each species for 10 or more years. Before either reclassification or delisting may be considered, threats to the species will be removed and plans should be developed and implemented to protect and monitor water and habitat quality in the watersheds where they occur.Actions needed:(1) Protect habitat integrity and water quality. (2) Develop mitigation strategies that give high priority to avoidance and restoration. (3) Promote increased levels of voluntary stewardship to reduce non-point source pollution from private land use. (4) Encourage and support community based watershed stewardship planning and action. (5) Develop and implement public education programs and materials defining ecosystem management and stewardship responsibilities. (6) Conduct basic research on endemic species and apply the results of this research to management. (7) Develop and implement technology for maintaining and propagating endemic species in captivity. (8) Reintroduce imperiled aquatic species into restored habitats, as appropriate. (9) Monitor listed species populations. (10) Coordinate ecosystem management actions.A specific recovery plan has been created for the Mobile River basin (USFWS 2000) which contains the following objectives: (1) protect habitat integrity and quality of river and stream segments that currently support it could support imperiled aquatic species, (2) consider options for free-flowing river and stream mitigation strategies that give high priority to avoidance and restoration, (3) promote voluntary stewardship as a practical and economical means of reducing non-point pollution from private land use, (4) encourage and support community based watershed stewardship planning and action, (5) develop and implement programs and materials to educate the public on the need and benefits of ecosystem management, and to involve them in watershed stewardship, (6) conduct basic basic research on endemic aquatic species and apply the results toward management and captivity, (8) reintroduce aquatic species into restored habitats as appropriate (9) monitor listed species population levels and distribution and periodically review ecosystem management strategy, (10) coordinate ecosystem management actions.Further research is recommended to determine the extent of the existing population and an estimate of extant individuals. All populations should be monitored&#160; periodically and habitat degradation identified and mitigated.A survey for potential reintroduction sites within the Black Warrior River drainage should be conducted. An ongoing captive propagation program started at the Tennessee Aquarium Research Institute should continue. Augmentation of the population in Locust Fork, using propagated juveniles, began in 2003 and continues.

This species is particularly susceptible to bleaching. Although the current population is persisting at a very low abundance and the current population trend appears to be stable, there are places where populations continue to decrease and others where there seems to be moderate or localized recovery. Whether mortality continues to exceed growth and recruitment or not, this species requires immediate investigation and monitoring on a regional scale.","This species is found in shallow tropical reef ecosystems, favouring outer reef slopes exposed to wave action. It has been recorded to depths of 22 m at Flower Garden Banks in the Gulf of Mexico (Zimmer et al. 2005), but this is a recent range extension potentially due to the results of climate change (Precht and Aronson 2004). The normal depth range is 0.5-5 m (Goreau and Wells 1967), but it can be found up to 40 m.This species has limited sexual recruitment.","The major threat to this species has been disease, specifically white-band disease which is believed to be the primary cause for the region wide acroporid decline during the 1980s (Aronson and Precht, 2001a,b) and is still ongoing (Williams and Miller, 2005). Other major threats include thermal-induced bleaching, storms, and other diseases (Rodriguez-Martinez et al. 2001,Precht et al. 2002,Patterson et al. 2002,&#160;Acropora BRT 2005). Localized declines are associated with: loss of habitat at the recruitment stage due to algal overgrowth and sedimentation; predation by snails; mortality by endolithic sponges; ship groundings, anchor damage, trampling, and marine debris. The long-term threat of reduced skeletal integrity due to ocean acidification is of particular concern due to the species' presence in wave-swept environments.In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil et al. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter et al. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland et al. 2004, Weil 2004). Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter et al. 2001, Patterson et al. 2002). Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs at high risk of collapse.Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","There has been an 80-98% loss of individuals in parts of the Caribbean since the 1980s. There have been some signs of recovery. A second report has validated declines on the order of 97% in the Florida Keys, Jamaica, Dry Tortugas, Belize and St Croix (Acropora BRT 2005) and Puerto Rico (Weil et al. 2003).There are signs of recovery in populations in some localities. For example, populations in St Croix showed increases from 2001-2003, although larger colonies are not surviving, as large colonies are more affected by stressors (Grober-Dunsmore et al. 2006). Similarly, there are signs of recovery in Puerto Rico and other parts of the southern Caribbean (E. Weil pers. comm.). However, some of these same populations have undergone subsequent declines.Overall, decline of destroyed and critical reefs in the Caribbean region has been 38% (according to Wilkinson 2004) however there have been much higher population reductions for this species as it is particularly susceptible to disease and bleaching.The age of first maturity of most reef building corals is typically three to eight years (Wallace 1999) and therefore we assume that average age of mature individuals is greater than eight years. Furthermore, based on average sizes and growth rates, we assume that average generation length is 10 years, unless otherwise stated. Total longevity is not known, but likely to be more than ten years. Therefore any population decline rates for the Red List assessment are measured over at least 30 years.

In addition to global climate change, corals are also threatened by a number of localized threats. Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.",This species is usually uncommon. This species is very rare and probably exists in less than 50 colonies (Fenner pers. comm.).,Unknown,"This species is known from only one small site in the Hawaiian Islands, on Molokai Island, and live colonies have only been seen by Don Potts and Cindy Hunter (Fenner pers. comm.).",,Marine,"All corals are listed on CITES Appendix II. Parts of this species distribution fall within several Marine Protected Areas within its range.Recommended measures for conserving this species include research in taxonomy, population, abundance and trends, ecology and habitat status, threats and resilience to threats, restoration action; identification, establishment and management of new protected areas; expansion of protected areas; recovery management; and disease, pathogen and parasite management. Artificial propagation and techniques such as cryo-preservation of gametes may become important for conserving coral biodiversity.Having timely access to national-level trade data for CITES analysis reports would be valuable for monitoring trends this species. The species is targeted by collectors for the aquarium trade and fisheries management is required for the species, e.g., Marine Protected Areas, quotas, size limits, etc. Consideration of the suitability of species for aquaria should also be included as part of fisheries management, and population surveys should be carried out to monitor the effects of harvesting.",,,False,False,Global,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
106,North America,Bombus franklini,ANIMALIA,ARTHROPODA,HYMENOPTERA,INSECTA,APIDAE,Bombus,franklini,A2ace,"R.W. Thorp‚Äôs unpublished surveys have revealed that, since 1998, the populations have decreased to the point of being not seen at all in 2004 or 2005, with only one individual found in 2006. Because extensive surveys of the area within which B. franklini exists have, as of 2006, uncovered only one individual, but similar surveys in the first three years (1998-2000) uncovered individuals at many historic and seven new sites, it can be concluded that the extent of population is decreasing severely. Though further investigation would be required to determine the exact number of extant B. franklini, based on their limited range, it can be assumed that their populations are decreasing to dangerously low levels, and therefore need protection, which it has not yet legally received.","The habitat of B. franklini includes floral resources, such as Lupinus, Eschscholzia, Agastache, Monardella and Vicia, and abandoned rodent burrows that are thought to be used for nesting.



 Bumblebees are social insects; they live in colonies. Most make their homes in abandoned animal
 burrows or in grassy tussocks, and feed on both the nectar and pollen rewards
 offered by the flowers of the plants they pollinate. Bumblebees have a special technique in foraging
 that makes them exclusive pollinators of certain plants. They engage in ‚Äúbuzz pollination‚Äù by which
 they sonicate the flowers to vibrate the pollen loose from the anthers.&#160; Tomatoes and related plants (Solanaceae),
 blueberries (Ericaceae), and others are pollinated this way.","The use of commercial bumblebee colonies in greenhouses to pollinate crops such as tomatoes, peppers and some field crops such as highbush blueberries has had an impact on bumblebee populations as exotic diseases are introduced into populations of native bee species. The commercialization of bumblebees in North America over the past two decades is thought to have caused a pathogen spillover that has devastated local, wild populations of the same and some other species. These pathogens include tracheal mites (Locustacarus buchneri) and intestinal protozoa (Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi), which can be transferred from bumblebee to bumblebee via the flowers upon which they feed, or within the colony. Although these pathogens are not necessarily lethal because they don‚Äôt directly kill their hosts, they reduce the bumblebees‚Äô ability to learn to handle or feed on new flower types (Gegear et al. 2004). This can have extremely detrimental consequences for the health of the colony, by reducing resources brought in from foraging, and thus limiting the size of the colony and number of offspring it can produce. For B. franklini, exotic diseases such as Nosema, which have been introduced through transportation and sale of commercial bumble bee queens and nests (Colla et al. 2006, Otterstatter et al. 2005, Thorp 2003).  Habitat destruction and degradation as a result of agricultural intensification is believed to threaten the future of this species habitat. Agricultural pesticides are also a threat as these can be picked up by bumblebees and, if not immediately deadly to the insects, carried back to their nests to poison other colony members and the brood. However, many efforts are being made to reduce, if not eliminate pesticide application, as the far-reaching repercussions of their use are well-understood.","The population is currently decreasing drastically. Dr R.W. Thorp‚Äôs unpublished surveys have revealed that, since 1998, the populations have decreased drastically, and no individuals were found at all in 2004. Surveys of many historic and potential sites within the area inhabited by these bumblebees were repeated annually over nine years. Between nine and seventeen historic sites were visited annually. Some were visited more than once for an average of visits of historic sites per year. In addition, six to nineteen potential sites were visited at least once each year. During the first three years, bees were observed at seven new sites (where this bee had not been recorded before) but as time went on this number decreased. The continued abundance of other bumblebee species suggests that the habitat has not recently become uninhabitable.",Decreasing,"Bombus franklini occurs only in the USA. It is found only from southern Oregon to northern California between the Coast and Sierra-Cascade Ranges, in Douglas, Jackson and Josephine and Siskiyou and Trinity counties in Oregon and California respectively. This area is around 190 miles in the north-south direction (40¬∫58‚Äô to 43¬∫30‚ÄôN latitude) and 70 miles from east to west (122¬∫ to 124¬∫W longitude).",,Terrestrial,"Currently there are no conservation measures in place to protect B. franklini. It would be beneficial to attempt to prevent the spread of commercially based disease pathogens to native populations, as these are thought to be having a major negative impact on B. franklini. Further research is needed for: the size and range of the remaining population: although very few individuals have been observed, further investigation should be done to reveal precisely how many B. franklini are remaining;the species' ecology and biology: a better understanding of the behaviours and general biology of the bee, and its habitat requirements, especially any that might be limiting factors; threats: studying the pathology, control, and cross-infectivity of different suspected disease agents of B. franklini, including Nosema bombi, Locustacrus buchneri, and Crithidia bombi (Colla et al. 2006, Otterstatter et al. 2005) would allow for better understanding of the risks to the bumblebee populations and the preventative measures that should be taken. The introduction of these diseases could also be better studies as an element of the risks of commercial trafficking in bumble bees (Thorp 2003);The habitat of B. franklini needs protection. The protected habitat must have an abundance of suitable pollen and nector aources such as, but not limited to: Lupinus, Eschscholzia, Agastache, Monardella as sources of pollen and nectar for the bees to feed on. Proximity to a natural source of fresh water would also be beneficial as it would increase the flowering season of the plants upon which the bees feed.

This species has an area of occupancy (AOO) less than 1 km¬≤ and occurs in only one cave. This cave specialist is likely to be sensitive to habitat alterations. It is inferred that this species&#160;is experiencing declines in abundance, due to the reduction in nutrient availability from Gray Bat guano since the bats have abandoned the cave. Attempts have been made to encourage the bats to return, but so far these attempts have proved unsuccessful. A cave fence has been erected to reduce vandalism, which has been successful. The NSS is controlling the number of visitors to the cave, but still allowing school groups to visit, thus continuing to cause disturbance to this species'&#160;habitat. However, no attempts have been made to improve the water quality of the cave, by reducing insecticide run-off from nearby gardens. Monitoring of the population numbers is needed as the population is likely to be small and any single significant threat may result in extinction.","This species is found in a subterranean lake and passage, where it is dependent on external nutrients entering the cave, such as leaf litter. In addition, the guano of the Gray Bat Myotis grisescens &#160;provides nutrient input&#160;(Cooper and Cooper 1997).","This species&#160;is impacted by a variety of threats, namely land development, vandalism, cave abandonment by Gray Bats, insecticides and water level fluctuations. In the 1960s, there was extensive vandalism in the cave while the surrounding land was developed with residential housing (Cooper and Cooper 1997). In 1967, the cave was purchased by the National Speleological Society (NSS) which owns the entrances and controls access to the cave. The Headquarters of the NSS has been built above the cave (Mississippi State University 2003). In an attempt to curb vandalism, cave gates were built at the entrances to the caves in 1968, but these were not conducive to Gray Bat colonization. By 1970, the bats had abandoned the cave, reducing the amount of nutrients available for this species. Overall cave biodiversity has declined since the Gray Bats left the cave (Cooper and Cooper 1997). In 2002, a fence was erected 20 feet around the cave to encourage the bats to return, and to continue to deter vandalism (NSS 2003). Some water chemistry analysis has been conducted at the cave, which found high levels of the insecticide Heptachlor epoxide in 1989 presumably from surrounding residential gardens (Mississippi State University 2003). Additionally, this area of Alabama, due to geological circumstances, is prone to having high levels of radon gas. Levels in the cave were very high at 400 - 500 pCi/L, although the impact of this on this species is unknown. Finally, this species&#160;is sensitive to water level fluctuations, common at this site as a result of droughts.&#160;The NSS is controlling the number of visitors to the cave, but still allows school groups to visit, thus continuing to cause disturbance to&#160;this species suitable&#160;habitat&#160;(S.

This species has a very restricted range with an extent of occurrence of 13 km2, and a range that is severely fragmented by the presence of dams and invasive species. There is an ongoing decline in the quality of this species habitat as a result of dam construction, and invasive species continue to drive a decline in the number of mature individuals. Measures are urgently required to control the spread of invasive species towards the relict, subpopulations of this species.","Pacifastacus fortis prefers rocky, gravelly bottoms, usually volcanic rubble (Bouchard 1978). This species has been found in spring pools and slow to moderately flowing waters, and also in cold clear lakes with little annual fluctuation in temperature (Eng and Daniels 1982). It requires a constant, steady, and untainted flow of fresh water to survive (American Fisheries Society Endangered Species Committee 1996). Pacifastacus fortis grows to 90mm total length and females reach maturity at 5 years old (Millar 2004).","This species faces a number of threats within its restricted range. This species has undergone significant habitat fragmentation as a result of water diversion and impoundments associated with 4 major hydroelectric dams (NatureServe 2009). Though range extent is still as it was historically, distribution is no longer continuous and the amount of occupied area within its range is significantly reduced (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1998, Light et al. 1995). The population of this species is now considered to be highly fragmented and split into isolated subpopulations as a result of dam construction (Millar 2004). Exotic and invasive species also pose another major threat to this species: it is likely that the decline of this species is linked to the spread of Pacifastacus leniusculus (Fetzner 2008) as well as Orconectes virilis, both of which have the characteristics typical of expanding populations (Daniels 1980, Light et al. 1995). Pacifastacus fortis is also subject to increased predation from non-native species such as muskrats, bullfrogs, and several species of introduced game fish (Millar 2004).","By 1990, Pacifastacus fortis was restricted to seven isolated localities, mostly in the headwaters of spring-fed tributaries of the Pit River. The Signal Crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) had become established throughout much of the study area within 12 years. In one site P. leniusculus probably contributed to the precipitous decline of this species, from 2000 - 3000 in 1980 to about 370 (+ 135) in 1991 (Light et al. 1995). Relict distribution exist today but no evidence the species had a wider range during historic times (Eng and Daniels 1982).&#160; Historically, distribution was more or less continuous throughout the Fall River, Hat Creek, and the segment of the Pit River that joins these drainages (Light et al. 1995).&#160; It was described in 1898 from the Fall River at Fall River Mills and Hat Creek at Cassel with subsequent collections from the Fall River system in 1934, 1964, 1973-1974; with collections in 1975 from all three river systems (headwaters of the Fall River, Sucker Springs Creek on the Pit River, Crystal Lake on Hat Creek).&#160; In 1978-1980 it was found in numerous locations in the Fall River system including the type locality as well as Sucker Springs Creek and the Pit River and in Crystal, Baum, and Rising River lakes on the Hat Creek system.&#160; Resurveys in 1985-1986 found no major changes in distribution but noted a declining population in Crystal Lake occurring with a large population of introduced Pacifastacus leniusculus in only five years plus new observations in Eastman Lake at the Lava Creek overflow, the Fall River at the mouth of Spring Creek, and Tritton Reservoir. Most recently in 1990-1991, Light et al. (1995) found it in a total of 14 sites comprising seven noncontiguous subpopulations separated by dams, gradient barriers and many stream km; mostly in the same areas as historically but now isolated in patches rather than distributed continuously. The marginal locations (Fall River, Pit River mainstem near sucker Springs, and Baum Lake) have not yielded specimens since 1980, though these represented washdowns or strays from nearby populations.",Decreasing,"This species is known only from Shasta County, California, USA. It is more specifically known from isolated portions of the Pit River drainage. The current range is greatly reduced to much smaller and more isolated stream sections in the same watersheds (Millar 2004). This species has an estimated extent of occurrence of 13 km2.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Pacifastacus fortis received protection under the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) and has been classified as 'endangered' by the American Fisheries Society (Taylor et al. 2007). This species has been assigned a Global Heritage Status Rank of G1 by NatureServe (2009).By installing and maintaining effective barriers in the river system, the plan to protect Pacifastacus fortis focuses on preventing the invasion of signal crayfish into the 20 remaining native subpopulations still free of the exotic species. When these subpopulations are stabilized, work will be done to remove signal crayfish from areas containing both crayfish species and additional barriers will also be installed. The plan requires government agencies to increase cooperative efforts with local landowners because much of the habitat is on private lands (Millar 2004).Culverts at Spring Creek Road have been replaced using a design to prevent signal crayfish migration. The fish hatchery at Sucker Creek has been removed and a barrier installed. Restoration has been carried out on eroded areas. A recovery plan calls for future repairs on water impoundments to be done with imported boulders to improve Shasta Crayfish habitat instead of locally dredged materials. Removal or controls of muskrat populations throughout the watershed are to be undertaken (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1998).

No known living populations have been found in numerous surveys of the Tennessee River since the 1960s, indicating dramatic population declines. However, no life history information is known fro this species, so that it is impossible to assess the percentage of the decline with respect to the species generation length. It therefore cannot qualify for criterion A. Its extent of occurrence is estimated as less than 100 km2, since it is currently only known to be extant in a single location, in the tailwaters of Wilson Dam on the Tennessee River in northwest Alabama. Collections at a second site, below Pickwick Dam near Savannah, Tennessee, last produced fresh dead specimens between 1979 and 1982. The species is therefore considered to be Critically Endangered under criterion B.","This species was presumed to inhabit shoals and riffles in large rivers like the Tennessee (Bogan and Parmalee 1983). It is a species of flowing water in medium to large rivers. It is generally found in substrates composed of a mixture of sand and gravel, where current keeps silt accumulation to a minimum. It is presumably a short-term brooder, gravid during spring and summer. Its glochidial hosts are unknown (Williams et al. 2008).","Smith (1971) ranked the causes of extirpation or declines in fish species as follows: siltation, drainage of bottomland lakes, swamps, and prairie marshes, desiccation during drought, species introductions, pollution, impoundments, and increased water temperatures. All of these factors render habitats unsuitable, cause extirpations, and lead to the isolation of populations thereby increasing their vulnerability to extirpation for many aquatic species (including mussels) throughout North America.Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, have destroyed mussel populations in the Great Lakes and significantly reduced mussels in many of the large rivers of eastern North America. Zebra mussels have the potential to severely threaten other populations especially if they make their way into smaller streams. Pollution through point (industrial and residential discharge) and non-point (siltation, herbicide and fertilizer run-off) sources is perhaps the greatest on-going threat to this species and most freshwater mussels. Lowered dissolved oxygen content and elevated ammonia levels (frequently associated with agricultural run-off and sewage discharge) have been shown to be lethal to some species of freshwater naiads (Horne and McIntosh 1979). Residential, mineral and industrial development also pose a significant threat. Rotenone, a toxin used to kill fish in bodies of water for increased sport fishery quality, has been shown to be lethal to mussels as well (Heard 1970). Destruction of habitat through stream channelization and maintenance and the construction of dams is still a threat in some areas. Impoundments reduce currents that are necessary for basic physiological activities such as feeding, waste removal and reproduction. In addition, reduced water flow typically results in a reduction in water oxygen levels and a settling out of suspended solids (silt, etc.), both of which are detrimental. Dredging of streams has an immediate effect on existing populations by physically removing and destroying individuals. Dredging also affects the long-term recolonization abilities by destroying much of the potential habitat, making the substrates and flow rates uniform throughout the system. Natural predators include raccoons, otter, mink, muskrats, turtles and some birds (Simpson 1899, Boepple and Coker 1912, Evermann and Clark 1918, Coker et al. 1921, Parmalee 1967, Snyder and Snyder 1969). Domestic animals such as hogs can root mussel beds to pieces (Meek and Clark 1912). Fishes, particularly catfish, Ictalurus spp. and Amieurus spp., and freshwater drum, Aplodinotus grunniens, also consume large numbers of unionids.USFWS (1984) lists the following reasons for decline: impoundment (for flood control, navigation, hydroelectric power production, and recreation), siltation (from strip mining, coal washing, dredging, farming, logging, and road construction), pollution (municipal, agricultural, and industrial waste discharges).If any populations still remain, they are isolated and extremely small with poor viability in the Tennessee River with poor dispersal capability (USFWS 1989).","The only recent record was the collection of fresh dead shells from a commercial shell pile in 1979 and 1982 below Pickwick Dam near Savannah, Tennessee (USFWS 1984). Both collections were older specimens. Currently the only known extant population is in the tailwaters of Wilson Dam on the Tennessee River in northwest Alabama where it is rare (Mirarchi et al. 2004).No live specimens have been collected in over 30 years and no estimates of population size or abundance have been made, but what few live specimens have been found have been single old individuals (USFWS 1989).Trends:Distribution has been greatly diminished with local and state extirpations, e.g. the Wabash in Illinois (Cummings and Mayer 1997) with all recent records bordering on historical and only one or two specimens found in the Tennessee River (USFWS 1989).No live specimens have been found in the Holston River, Cumberland River, Ohio River, Wabash River, and Konawha River since before the turn of the 20th Century (USFWS 1989). It is extirpated from Kentucky but formerly occurred in the Ohio and lower Cumberland rivers (Cicerello and Schuster 2003). It historically occurred in the Wabash mainstem in Indiana (Fisher 2006).",Decreasing,"Historically, this species was widely distributed in the Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee drainages including the Wabash, Ohio, Kanawha, Cumberland, Holston, and Tennessee rivers (USFWS 1984). No live specimens have been found in the Wabash, Ohio, Kanawha, Cumberland, or Holston rivers since around the turn of the century. It possibly still exists in a very short reach of the Tennessee River mainstem below Pickwick Dam near Savannah, Tennessee, near river mile 207 because all of the most recent historical records were from the original Tennessee River channel (USFWS 1984, Parmalee and Bogan 1998). The only other potential extant population is in the tailwaters of Wilson Dam on the Tennessee River where it is rare (Mirarchi et al. 2004). It historically occurred in the Wabash mainstem in Indiana (Fisher 2006).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The recovery plan (USFWS, 1984) outlines the following strategy: (1) preserve any known populations and presently used habitat, (2) determine the feasibility of introducing the species back into rivers within its historic range and introduce where feasible, (3) conduct life history studies, (4) determine the number of individuals required to maintain a viable population, (5) investigate the necessity for habitat improvement and, if feasible and desirable, identify techniques and sites for improvement to include implementation, (6) develop and implement a program to monitor population levels and habitat conditions of presently established populations as well as introduced and expanding populations, (7) assess overall success of recovery program and recommend action.There are no known occurrences in protected sites. Nonessessential Experimental Populations (NEPs) have been proposed for reintroduction into the free-flowing reach of the French Broad River below Douglas Dam (Knox and Sevier Cos., Tennessee) to its confluence with the Holston River, Knox Co., Tennessee, and in the free-flowing reach of the Holston River below Cherokee Dam to its confluence with the French Broad River (Knox, Grainger, and Jefferson Cos., Tennessee), where this species currently does not exist (USFWS, 2006).Williams et al.

This species has an area of occupancy of less than 10 km¬≤ and occurs in one cave chamber locality. It is threatened by water pollution and has experienced disturbance from tourists (snorkelers and scuba divers) although the latter has now been outlawed.  More decisive protection measures should be implemented, such as the construction of cave gates, to protect this species and other cave fauna. Currently, the life history of this species is unknown, but due to the low levels of nutrients reaching the cave chamber due to the strong outflow current, it can be assumed that this species has a late reproductive maturity and a long life history making it susceptible to loss of individuals.","This species is found in subterranean waters in a cave chamber 213 m from its main entrance, consisting of a water depth of 49 m (Hobbs and Franz 1992). Individuals were observed sequestering in crevices or on the substrate. This cave system has a strong outflow current, and as a result there is no accumulation of organic detritus in the cave. Furthermore, the food source for this species may come from bacterial growth and the death of other cave species (Hobbs and Franz 1992). The life history of this species is unknown, but due to the low levels of nutrients reaching the cave chamber due to the strong outflow current, it can be assumed that this species has a late reproductive maturity and a long life history making it susceptible to loss of individuals.","The cave where this species is present, is located in a recreation area in the Ocala Natural Forest (Florida Adventuring 2008). The pool outside of the cave was used frequently by tourists for snorkelling and scuba diving (Florida Adventuring 2008), although this has now been prohibited (P. Moler pers. comm. 2010).

The perennial or near-perennial habitats from which they are known or likely to have occurred include springs, cienagas, earthen cattle tanks, small creeks, and slack water of main-stem rivers. Most habitats are modified or artificial aquatic systems (Sredl and Saylor 1998; Sredl et al. 1997). Deep areas, root masses, and undercut banks are used when escaping capture. Habitat heterogeneity is likely important. The frogs will move into newly created suitable habitat rapidly, if near to occupied habitat (Sredl 2005).

154,North America,Stereolepis gigas,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PERCIFORMES,ACTINOPTERYGII,POLYPRIONIDAE,Stereolepis,gigas,A1bd,"Giant Sea Bass was classified as a Critically Endangered species by IUCN in 1996. This assessment presents additional information to support that assessment. The American Fisheries Society classified the species as Threatened (Musick et al. 2000).  Pre-exploitation biomass for Southern California populations of the Giant Sea Bass was estimated to be 1,300 tons (1,179 tonnes) (Ragen 1991). The fish was so heavily exploited in both California and Mexican waters that the commercial landings declined rapidly from 115 tonnes in 1932 to 5 tonnes in 1980 in California waters, whereas it decreased greatly from 363 tonnes to 12 tonnes in Mexican waters over the same period (Domeier 2001). The annual landings (in tonnes) of the species in California fluctuated in the 1990s: 3.3 (1990), 5.3 (1991), 3.9 (1992), 2.1 (1993), 0.4 (1994), 0.5 (1995), 0.9 (1996), 1.1 (1997), 2.9 (1998), 2.4 (1999), 2.0 (2000) and 2.6 (2001) (NMFS 2003). Reports of landings from Hawaii from NMFS, WpacFIN website and DAR (2003) are in error, the correct species being Epinephelus quernus. The error is due to the wrong common name being used in these reports (W. Ikehara pers. comm.).  Currently, it is suggested that the population size of Giant Sea Bass in California may be increasing as it is under protection (Domeier 2001); however, there are no hard data to support it. Due to the heavy harvest in Mexico and the long generation time (estimated at 7‚Äì10 years) (Domeier 2001). It is also possible that the species may need additional protection in Mexico but more information is needed. The current status should not be changed until data about the actual or relative abundance of the species are collected.  The species is particularly vulnerable due to its very limited distribution, its very large size and its aggregation spawning. It is not known how effective management is.","Juveniles are usually found in and around kelp beds as well as sandy bottom areas at depths 12‚Äì21 m (Crooke 1992), whereas adults are usually found deeper than 30 m and they tend to inhabit rocky bottoms where kelp beds are nearby (Eschmeyer et al. 1983).
 
 Reproductive Biology
 The fish mature at 7 to 10 years (Domeier 2001). The maximum size of male/unsexed giant sea bass is 250 cm TL (IGFA 2001). Spawning aggregations are formed and remain together for one or two months over the period of June to September (Crooke 1992).","The major threat is from overfishing; however, the species is protected in California (this legislation also covers U.S. fishers in Mexican waters) although incidental catches are allowed (see Conservation Measures below).",It is now very rare in the Gulf of California (Musick et al. 2000). Minimum population doubling time is more than 14 years (Musick et al. 2000).,Unknown,"Eastern Pacific: from Humboldt Bay in California, U.S.A. to the tip of Baja, Mexico; also found in the northern half of the Gulf of California (Domeier 2001). Supposedly also occurs in the coastal waters of northern Japan (the Sea of Japan) (Masuda et al. 1992); but the occurrence in Japan is probably a misidentification (Domeier 2001).",,Marine,"The fish has been protected in California since 1982 and protected in Mexico since 1992 (Crooke 1992).  California State Legislature banned both commercial and recreational fishing for Giant Sea Bass in 1981 in response to the great decline in population, but it allowed two fish per angler per trip when fishing south of United States-Mexico border (Crooke 1992) and allowed one fish per trip if taken incidentally in gill or trammel net by commercial fisherman (Domeier 2001).  The species can still be caught in Mexico (M. Domeier, pers. comm.).  The law limited the amount of Giant Sea Bass that could be taken in Mexican waters and landed in California (could not land more than 3,000 lbs in a calendar year). The ban of inshore gill nets in California was introduced in 1990, which was considered a way to significantly reduce the incidental mortality of Giant Sea Bass (Domeier 2001).",Nearctic|Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

This species has an area of occupancy of less than 0.5 km2 and occurs at just two localities which are severely fragmented. In 2006, 23 individuals were recorded, 14 at Hell's Creek and nine at Nesbitt Cave. Extensive searches have been conducted to locate other populations of this species in the area, but so far none have been recorded. This species is threatened by a variety of factors, namely groundwater pollution, vandalism, trespassing, collectors and a reduction in nutrient availability. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has put in place an Action Plan for Hell's Creek Cave including the installation of cave gates, fences and a monitoring programme. However, even with these preventative measures in place, human disturbance continues to occur and degrade this species habitat. No action plan has been initiated for Nesbitt's Cave. Ground water pollution continues to occur, with no measures in place to prevent refuse dumping, the repairing of septic tanks or sewage contamination. Due to the delicate environment that this species inhabits, its access to sufficient nutrients is limited, and reliant on Grey Bat guano and leaf litter from flood waters. However, Grey Bats have not been recorded in Hell's Creek Cave for some time, thus limiting nutrient intake of this species. So far, it is unknown what impact this reduction in nutrients is having on this species. Even with an Action Plan in place, this species continues to be susceptible to habitat degradation and human disturbance.","This species is found in subterranean streams, between one and two meters wide and one to eight meters deep (Hobbs and Bedinger 1964). The water temperature was 14.5oC. This species is found both on the rock sides and mud bottom of the streams (Hobbs and Bedinger 1964). This species dislikes turbid water and will crawl up the sides of the stream to clearer water or move to deeper areas (Hobbs and Bedinger 1964). It is reliant on nutrients from Grey Bat guano, which use the caves to roost, and from leaf litter which enters the caves by floodwaters (Natural Heritage 2009). The caves are situated in an area of sinking streams which supply groundwater (Graening et al. 2006). The groundwater recharge area is 9 km2 (Natural Heritage 2009).","This species is threatened by groundwater contamination, vandalism, collectors, trespassing, and the removal of the Grey Bat population. The two caves where this species is located are in an area characterized by sinking streams. These streams are vital for the transition of nutrients to the caves. However, these also cause pollutants to be easily introduced to the groundwater system through the recharge zone (Natural Heritage 2009). The caves are downstream from Mountain View City and a major highway resulting in the introduction of sewage, siltation from construction, and chemicals from spills into the recharge system (Natural Heritage 2009). Illegal refuse dumping, salvage yards and malfunctioning septic tanks are also polluting the groundwater system (Graening et al. 2006). An electrical transmission line also crosses the recharge area, and herbicides have been used to clear the right-of-way (Natural Heritage 2009). Vandalism, trespassing and collectors are also major threats to C. zophonastes. Due to its sensitivity to water disturbance and turbidity, and due to its low population numbers, it is susceptible to the removal of individuals and human disturbance (Graening et al. 2006). Once, 16,000 grey bats roosted in the caves, but for several years they have not been recorded. The loss of nutrients from the guano may have limited the population size of C. zophonastes and is now reliant on leaf litter nutrients which are brought in from floodwaters. The federal recovery plan (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1988) cited limiting factors such as destruction of habitat, scientific collection, disturbance by amateur cavers, and lack of reproduction. Updated threat information can be found in Graening et al. (2006). Although over-collection may have been a significant mortality factor in the past, scientific collection has ceased and no amateur collection is known.&#160; Recreational caving impacts and habitat destruction continue to be potential factors threatening the viability of this species.&#160; ","This species was previously known from one pool, at one cave.&#160; Recent survey work has located an additional population, also in Stone County, Arkansas (Graening et al. 2006). An additional 29 cave streams in Stone County revealed no additional populations beyond this one and it was also not found in another 50 caves outside this area.Up until recently, the total population of this species had been estimated at fewer than 50 individuals (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1988) from a single cave at the type locality. Historically published observed specimens from this locality include 5 specimens in 1961, two in 1972, 15 in 1983, 13 in 1990, 6 in 2000 (two in the first pool and four more in non-submerged passages), 8 in 2001 (most upstream to 300 m in unmapped passages), and 6 in 2003 (Graening et al. 2006).&#160; In 1992, several stygobitic crayfish were reported from the second locality and later censuses confirmed the identity of two specimens in 2002 and 14 in 2005 (Graening et al. 2006).",Unknown,"This species is found in Hell Creek Cave and has recently expanded to Nesbitt Spring Cave, Stone County, Arkansas, USA (Graening et al. 2006).

The US Fish and Wildlife Service compiled a species recovery plan for this species in 1988, citing limiting factors and stating that there should be regular surveys of the population and analyses of habitat quality (Graening et al. 2006). As a result of this action plan, cave gates and fencing have been installed at Hells Creek Cave, although trespassing and vandalism continue to occur (Graening et al. 2006). The land adjacent to Hells Creek Cave is protected as part of the Hells Creek Natural Area (Graening et al. 2006). Protection of the cave and its recharge zone is being implemented largely through the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission and The Nature Conservancy. The groundwater recharge area was defined as a 906 ha zone.&#160; Lands adjacent to the cave are protected within a Natural Area and attempts to expand that area are underway.&#160; A site conservation and management plan has been prepared and installation of cave gates, fencing, and monitoring has secured the entrances to the cave although trespass and vandalism continue to occur (Graening et al. 2006, USFWS 1988).

This species has an estimated extent of occurrence of 86 km¬≤ and is only known from one location. There has been a significant decline in the population of this species as a result of drying of the stream in which it is found, however it is also threatened by pollution, deforestation and agriculture all of which affect the quality of this species. Sand mining has also recently been proposed within the area. Monitoring of the population and range of this species is needed.","This species is found in small to large streams where they are found beneath large rocks in moderate to slow current (Williams et al. 2006). These streams are known to dry periodically (R. Thoma, T. Jones and J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2009).","Habitat loss and poor water quality issues from point and non-point source pollution have plagued aquatic organisms within these streams for many decades (R. Thoma, T. Jones and J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2009). While efforts are currently underway to improve water quality in a few streams, much of the watershed continues to suffer from historical surface coal mining practices (R. Thoma, T. Jones and J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2009). Although much of the East Fork Obey River system remains forested, increasing residential development, logging, and agricultural practices pose continuing threats. Note there is the potential (not realized) threat of a large sand mine being considered for construction in the heart of the range of this species (R. Thoma to C. Taylor pers. comm. 2008).","In 2004 and 2005, catch per unit effort (CPUE) values were highest on Little Piney Creek and Hurricane Creek site 2 with catch rates of 13.0 and 9.6 specimens per hour respectively. Hurricane Creek site 1 and Little Hurricane Creek were somewhat lower with 6.7 and 6.0 specimens per hour, which can most likely be attributed to a reduction of the preferred habitat (large flat rocks in moderate to slow current). Interestingly, this species was always the most common species encountered where it occurred during surveys (Williams et al. 2006), although one population may have been lost in Dripping Springs Creek (more surveys are needed to confirm this (R. Thoma, T. Jones and J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2009). All historical occurrences have recently been confirmed to be extant and viable (Williams et al. 2006).&#160; However, in 2008, most of the streams dried completely; in the dried stream reaches numerous dead specimens were observed. This drying event causes fluctuations in population numbers, and may have resulted in a loss of over 50% of the species' population (T. Jones, R. Thoma pers. comm. 2009).",Decreasing,"This species was first found in Big Hurricane Creek at the Putnam-Cumberland County Line in Tennessee, USA (Hobbs and Shoup 1947). This creek is a head water stream, which flows into the East Fork of the Obey River in the Cumberland Drainage, Tennessee. It is now known only from three localities within these headwaters in Fentress, Putnam and Overton counties. However, the known distribution suggests that this species is restricted to the upper reaches of streams that remain on the table rock portion of the Cumberland Plateau, upstream of where the streams have began to cut through the Pennsylvanian Sandstone caps (Williams et al. 2006).

This species has an area of occupancy of less than 10 km¬≤ as each of the four cave pools has a maximum area of 200 m¬≤. The caves are severely fragmented and they are not connected to each other. There is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of habitat due to continued human disturbances and impacts through trampling and groundwater pollution. This species is extremely sensitive to groundwater quality and there is evidence that it is preyed on by Banded Sculpin (Cottus carolinae). It has a very low population, of only 40 individuals, and longevity of 75 years indicating that there is a late age of reproductive maturity. A recovery plan has been initiated by the USFWS in 1996, which has been implementing measures to protect this species. However, even with this recovery plan in place, the population still remains low and sensitive to disturbance and quality of habitat.","This species is a cave dwelling species inhabiting subterranean streams and pools (Jacobson 1996). One of the caves from which this species is known is an Ozarkian solution channel, within which this species has been observed along the side walls of a pool or at the stream margin (Robison and Allen 1995). Cave streams in which this species lives are generally less than 50 cm deep.","The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS 1996) recovery plan listed the following factors causing decline of the species: habitat destruction, disturbance by cavers or trespassers, specimen collection, low reproductive potential, and competition and predation by non-stygobitic species, Banded Sculpin (Cottus carolinae).&#160; Graening et al. (2006) have assessed continuing threats since the recovery plan. Among these, habitat degradation from groundwater pollution is the primary reason for federal listing of the species and remains a serious threat.&#160; Organic pollutants are present in the groundwater basins of the two initial caves.&#160; Mean concentrations of nitrate, phosphorous, and faecal bacteria consistently equals or exceeds those of regional surface waters monitored by the National Water Quality Assessment Program for the Springfield Plateau Aquifer. Over 100 confined animal feeding operations (poultry and swine) and cattle ranching operations as well as over 60 residences on septic systems are within the recharge zone of one cave and two confined feeding operations, and at least 200 residences on septic systems are within the discharge zone of the second cave (Graening et al. 2006).&#160; As for human disturbance, both caves with the largest populations were both formerly popular recreational destinations.&#160; Vandalism and trespassing continue to be serious management issues at both sites, even after erection of steel channel gates.&#160; Trampling was formerly considered a threat at all sites but has been alleviated at one cave when a fixed line was bolted to a canyon ledge 3 m above the stream in 2001 (Graening et al. 2006).&#160; Another historical threat was overcollection but scientific collection has ceased and no amateur collection has been reported, probably due to federal listing in 1993 (Graening et al. 2006). More specifically, hog and poultry operations, fertilization of nearby pasture lands, regional airport expansion, and residential development threaten the water quality of the second cave. Residential development is the primary threat to water quality in the largest cave occurrence (USFWS 1996). ","This species was surveyed thoroughly between 1985 and 2006, at all four caves, and a total of 40 individuals were collected (Graening et al. 2006). Two of the four sites are considered viable, one with decent viability (Graening et al. 2006).&#160; Probably &lt; 200 adults are extant. Numbers of crayfish observed vary dramatically between cave visits. The greatest number observed at one time in one cave is nine and in the other cave 21 (USFWS, 1996).&#160; The current total observed population size is 40 individuals, based on the latest complete visual census of the second largest occurrence (n=6), largest occurrence (n=31), small occurrence (n=2), and the smallest creek pool discharge occurrence (n=1) (Graening et al. 2006).

With all of the effort to look for cave organisms based out of Fayetteville, a great deal of search has been focused in the area to find further specimens of this species. It has long seemed confined to the original caves, yet recent discoveries have added 2 additional sites nearby - both based on one or two specimens. In Missouri, expert survey work has been carried out with no further discoveries of the species in that state (Brian Wagner, AR Game and Fish, to Cindy Osborne, AR Heritage, pers. comm. 2002).

This species is only known from three separate caves in a single Oklahoma county with no additional localities found despite extensive survey effort in and around the area.&#160; However, as all three caves are within close proximity of each other and all are threatened by agricultural waste, these are treated as one location. The surrounding land-use consists of intensive agriculture; primarily hog and poultry farming. This results in wastes and agricultural pollutants seeping into both the groundwater and Neshos River, degrading the habitat quality for this species. However, measures have been put in place in an attempt to reduce the impact of groundwater pollution. The Nature Conservancy's Oklahoma Field Office has purchased 10 ha of land, which includes the entrance to the main cave and has created a preserve around this particular cave. The US Fisheries and Wildlife Service have management agreements with the landowners of the other two caves, to survey them for periodic monitoring. However, nothing has been done to improve the water quality of the Neshos river or to alter farming practices, in order to reduce animal waste seepage into the groundwater from other areas around the three caves.","This species is known to inhabit cave streams and pools, on clay covered with silt at a maximum depth of 3 - 4 m. It can also be found on mud-bottomed pools, and gravel and mud pools rarely deeper than 1 m (Hobbs 1993).","This species is threatened by habitat degradation. The most important threat to this species is the disposal of untreated animal wastes from surrounding large hog farms and poultry houses which are seeping into the groundwater, polluting subterranean waters (Hobbs 1993). This is further amplified by the pollution of the Nesho River, through excessive nutrient loading and the presence of toxic organic compounds and metals (Graening and Fenolio 2005).","At present only 34 specimens are known (Graening and Fenolio 2005).

This species has an extent of occurrence of less than 100 km¬≤ and occurs in two caves which are severely fragmented. There is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of habitat as a result of pesticides and nutrient loading. While there are several conservation plans in place to protect the immediate land outside of the caves, along with installation of cave gates to restrict access, no attempts have been made to improve the groundwater or river water quality. The land outside of the natural refuges are continuing to feed polluted water into groundwater areas, increasing levels of metals, toxins and reducing the levels of dissolved oxygen, negatively impacting this highly adapted cave species. This species is particularly vulnerable to threats as it is slower to reach sexual maturity, and lives for longer than many other crayfish species.","This species is found in subterranean streams in two caves.

The conduit at the first cave is 1,800 m long and the passage in the second cave is 350 m long.","This species is threatened by declines in water quality. Spavinaw Creek is an impaired water body due to excessive nutrient loading caused by the numerous confined animal feeding operations upstream, and the city of Colcord, which discharges its treated municipal sewage into the watershed (Graening et al. 2006). Additionally, these caves also encompass the Neosho River, which has a low dissolved oxygen content, altered pH and contains toxic organic compounds, metals and pesticides (Graening et al. 2006). This species is vulnerable to changes in water quality conditions, because it is highly adapted to stable subterranean environments. Due to this being a cave dwelling species, it is late to reach reproductive maturity, and has increased longevity. As a result of this, it is susceptible to the accumulation of toxins in the water over a period of many years causing long term impacts (Graening et al. 2006).","This species has been found in two caves. The first cave contained 17 individuals, with 63 in the second cave (Graening et al. 2006). There is a now a total of 80 individuals, which has increased from the six that Hobbs and Cooper recorded in 1972.",Unknown,"This species was, until 2006, only found in one cave, but it has now expanded to a second cave in the Spavinaw Creek watershed (which also includes the Neosho River), north of Colcord, Delaware County, Oklahoma, USA (Graening et al. 2006). The caves are 10.8 km apart from each other (Graening et al. 2006). The extent of occurrence of this species has been estimated as less than 100 km2.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species has been given a NatureServe Global Heritage Status Rank of G1 (Taylor et al. 2007, NatureServe 2009), and was assigned an American Fisheries Society Status of 'endangered' based on its restricted range, and existing or potential destruction of habitat (Taylor et al. 2007). Conservation actions have been implemented at these two caves. The land surrounding the cave entrances have been acquired, and cave gates have been installed (Graening et al. 2006). The first cave and the 24 ha surrounding it, were donated by the Looney Family to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, creating the Mary Looney Unit of the Ozark Plateau National Wildlife Refuge (Graening et al. 2006). The Long Family sold 61 ha containing the second cave to The Nature Conservancy in 1997, which now manages the caves within the Eucha Nature Preserve (Graening et al. 2006). Groundwater recharge zone delineations and hazard assessments have been performed for the second cave, but have still yet to be implemented at the first cave (Graening et al. 2006).",Nearctic,,False,False,Global,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

170,North America,Haliotis cracherodii,ANIMALIA,MOLLUSCA,LEPETELLIDA,GASTROPODA,HALIOTIDAE,Haliotis,cracherodii,A4e,"H. cracherodii began supporting a commercial fishery in California in 1968. In the mid 1980s a wasting disease, Withering Syndrome, began to appear, reducing the commercial catch considerably. At present, the harvest of black abalone is illegal in California, but the species is still harvested commercially in Mexico. At most surveyed locations where the disease was present, black abalone populations were reduced by more than 80%. Fishers on the southern shore of Santa Cruz Island made the first observation of this disease in 1985. It has since spread throughout all the California Channel Islands and northwards to Monterey. In Mexico, cases of Withering Syndrome have been reported as far south as Cedros Island in Baja California. The spread of the disease now extends over almost the entire range of the species.

 Withering Syndrome does not appear to showing any signs of relenting in its progression along the coast in either direction. The strong correlation between adult abundance and recruitment suggests that larvae do not disperse very far from their point of origin, thus depleted abalone populations are unlikely to be restored by recruitment from distant populations.

 If no action is taken, it is estimated that H. cracherodii will decline by at least 80% over a period of three generations (from approximately 1975 to 2015), extending into the past and the future, and consequently, the species qualifies for Critically Endangered under criterion A4.","H. cracherodii is a sessile marine gastropod. It clamps tightly to rocky substrates and feeds on algal matter scraped from the rock surface. Gametes are released into the water where fertilization occurs to produce free-swimming larvae. Successful fertilization requires aggregated adults and synchronized gonad development and release (McShane 1996). After approximately 15 days as non-feeding zooplankton, the larvae metamorphose into their adult form, develop a shell, and settle onto a hard substrate (Douros 1985). Juveniles mainly reside in rocky crevices and feed primarily on benthic diatoms, bacterial films and algae found on coralline algal substrate (NMFS 2000). As juveniles, abalone are vulnerable to predators which graze the surfaces of coralline algae and associated species (McShane 1989). As they increase in size they become less vulnerable to predation and are able to emerge from their sheltered habitat and search out more desirable food sources (NMFS 2000). Adult abalone depend primarily on drift algae (Tegner and Dayton 1987). Main predators of adult abalone are fishes, otters and humans.
 
 Most black abalone are found in the intertidal zone, ranging from the high tide line to a depth of up to five meters (Lindberg 1989).
 
 Generation time is not easy to determine. Individuals do not display the same growth rate and older individuals may cease to grow altogether (B. Tissot, Washington University, pers comm.). Reproductive maturity is reached between three and seven years (when They are re approximately 130-150 mm in length), but life expectancy ranges from 25 to 75 years. Taking an average of these provides only a very rough estimate for the average age of parents, especially since the relationship between age and fecundity is unknown. Nonetheless, generation time is estimated to be between 14 and 41 years, thus a minimum three generation period would be 42 years (Smith et al. 2001).","Withering Syndrome (WS) is the main threat to black abalone. It is manifested by epipodial discoloration, loss of appetite, severe weight loss and atrophy of the foot muscle. As a consequence, abalone lose their ability to adhere to the substratum and eventually die (Tissot 1991, Haaker et al. 1992). The first reports of WS were in black abalone were made by fishers on the southern shore of Santa Cruz Island (Lafferty and Kuris 1993). The disease then spread throughout all the Californian Channel Islands from 1985 to 1992, except Santa Catalina Island, where no studies have been conducted (Haaker et al. 1992, Lafferty and Kuris 1993, Van Blaricom et al. 1993). At most surveyed locations black abalone were initially reduced to less than 20% of their initial densities (Tissot 1990, Davis et al. 1992, Richards and Davis 1993, Altstatt et al. 1996). Some have completely lost their black abalone populations (P. Hakker pers. comm.).  Black abalone are also affected by the large human population inhabiting southern California, the majority of which reside within 50 km of the coast (Parker et al. 1992). Coastal development, such as residential areas, harbours and coastal access points and large ocean discharges of municipal and industrial wastes contribute to the degradation and loss of near shore habitat (Parker et al. 1992). Commercial and recreational fishing have also placed black abalone populations under intense pressure. The large decline in fisheries landings may have been a consequence of over harvesting (Parker et al. 1992), however the mass mortality of populations in the Channel Islands that began in 1985 has been attributed to WS and continued fishing (Haaker et al. 1992).  Other possible threats to the species include storm, competition with other marine organisms and predation (Smith et al. 2001).","Large-scale commercial fishery of black abalone began in California in 1968 (Haaker et al. 1995). Like most other abalone fisheries, black abalone landings underwent a rapid rise, peaking in 1973 at a maximum catch of over 800 metric tonnes, followed by a decline (Parker et al. 1992). In 1992, commercial landings had diminished to 17.4 metric tonnes, as a wasting disease, Withering Syndrome (WS) spread throughout southern California (Haaker et al. 1992, Haaker et al. 1995).",Decreasing,"The black abalone, Haliotis cracherodii, is found in intertidal waters off California, USA, and Baja California, Mexico.",,Marine,"All abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game. The restrictions employed can range from minimum legal size limits and bag limits to harvest seasons and closures (Breen 1989, P. Haaker pers. comm.). The harvest of black abalone is currently illegal in California.
 
 In Mexico, green abalone, H. fulgens and pink abalone H. corugata are the main focus of commercial fishery. Black abalone do not form a large proportion of total abalone landings. Exclusive rights to abalone exploitation were granted to cooperative fishers' organizations. Although new legislation in 1992 allowed for the entry of the private sector into the fishery, all abalone harvesting is still done by cooperatives (Ramande-Villanueva et al. 1998). Total allowable catches per cooperative (TACCs) were introduced in 1973, but their criteria have changed appreciably over the years (Ramande-Villanueva et al. 1998). Since black abalone make up such a small proportion of the commercial catch in Mexico, it is difficult to assess the impact of these regulations on the species.
 
 In January 1999 the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) published its updated list of candidate species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Black abalone was one of 14 new species added to the list (NMFS 1999). The NMFS intends to conduct a review to determine whether black abalone deserves a national listing of endangered or threatened (P. Haaker, pers. comm.). Listing as a candidate species does not, however, provide substantive or procedural protection for the species under the ESA (NMFS 1999).
 
 Stock restoration by transplantation from distant populations has been proposed to restore depleted populations (Tissot 1997). Smith et al. (2001) propose that both American and Mexican fishery authorities work together to develop a re-stocking program to help restore black abalone populations all along the coast, especially in key locations such as the Channel Islands. Since the greatest threat facing the black abalone is disease, special precaution must be taken to ensure that the transplantation of adult abalone does not create a new path for the spread of WS.
 
 While not an especially charismatic species, many living in coastal California and Baja California recognize that the black abalone is important to local economies. A well designed public education campaign may result in a successful appeal for public funding (Smith et al. 2001).
 
 There is a need to survey areas where the status of black abalone populations are currently unknown, namely the coastline between Los Angeles and central Baja California, in addition to new surveys being carried out at sites previously examined. A study of withered black abalone at the northern fringe of WS's current range (Monterey and San Francisco) (Smith et al. 2001).
 
 Perhaps most importantly, further investigation of WS itself is also needed (Smith et al. 2001), including investigation into whether WS is caused by an introduced pathogen, identification of other species that may serve as reservoir hosts, and identification of resistant individuals for potential brood stock and development of husbandry.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

This frog spends the majority of its life in or near underground refugia and historically used gopher tortoise burrows for this purpose (Allen 1932; Richter et al. 2001). The Glen's Pond population occurs in an area presently lacking gopher tortoises, although tortoises probably occurred historically in the area and do occur nearby. Refugia include abandoned mammal burrows and holes in and under old stumps (L.V. LaClaire pers. obs., 1996; Richter et al. 2001). This species does not adapt to human disturbance of its habitat.","Major threats include population isolation (inbreeding and susceptibility to catastrophic events), urbanization, two diseases, and apparent lack of a nearby suitable habitat. The range has been significantly reduced as a result of habitat destruction, fragmentation, and modification. Pre-settlement longleaf pine forests were the dominant forest type of the south-eastern coastal plain. Today, less than two percent of the original longleaf pine forests remain (Ware, Frost and Doerr 1993). These areas are usually second-growth forests often degraded by turpentine, grazing, and disruption of the natural fire regime (Boyce and Martin 1993; Ware, Frost and Doerr 1993). Many areas have been converted from open longleaf pine sand hill communities to dense monocultures of sand, loblolly, or slash pine (Boyce and Martin 1993; Ware, Frost and Doerr 1993). Land management practices have altered the soil horizon, forest litter, herbaceous community, and the occurrence of fallen trees and stumps used as refugia. Isolated temporary wetlands are required for breeding. Factors affecting quality of breeding ponds include timber site preparation methods that alter existing hydrology, domestic animal grazing, clearing and draining for agricultural or urban uses, ditching, soil disturbance, and fire exclusion. The breeding habitat at Glen's Pond, and most of the surrounding adult habitat, are located in the DeSoto National Forest. Silviculture, including timber sales with associated clear-cutting, is the primary activity in this area. Less than 50 percent of the Forest is maintained as longleaf pine, with the remainder converted to slash pine or loblolly pine. The Mississippi Gulf Coast has experienced a recent upsurge in residential development, largely as a consequence of gambling casinos located in the Biloxi-Gulfport area. The land immediately north and west of the only known breeding site was owned by International Paper and managed for paper production until it was sold in 1999 to a land developer who intends to build a retirement community and golf course. This development will make conducting prescribed burns difficult and increase the chances of further modification to the breeding site and the associated upland habitat. The US Forest Service is negotiating the purchase of a small (30 ha) buffer to facilitate burning. Habitat alteration is likely the primary factor in the loss of gopher frog populations in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. At least 13 (72 percent) of the 18 historic gopher frog sites have been degraded due to intensive forestry practices. Forests around breeding ponds were clear-cut extensively in the mid-1950s and then again in the 1980s and 1990s. In most cases, these forests were replaced with dense pine plantations. Within these plantations and in the longleaf pine habitats, fire suppression has further has reduced the quality of the terrestrial and aquatic habitat for the Dusky Gopher Frog. Both the forests and the ponds have lost the open, grassy character that is necessary habitat for the species. Canopy closure from fire suppression also alters the forest floor vegetation. Without fire, encroachment of woody vegetation threatens the open, herbaceous character typical of most gopher frog breeding ponds. In addition, fire causes the release of nutrients bound in plant material. This release of nutrients results in a flush of primary productivity that is important to the herbivorous gopher frog tadpoles. Fire suppression has negatively impacted at least 13 (72 percent) of the 18 historical sites, but controlled burns conducted 1987-2003 have improved conditions at Glen's Pond. Expanding urbanization has been a factor in the degradation of at least three (17 percent) other sites. One of these historic breeding ponds is in a residential backyard and has been altered to hold water permanently (Thomas 1996). Forestry practices and expanding urbanization are also threats to the single remaining population. For example, a four-lane highway is being constructed that will further subdivide available habitat. Direct take for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes is not currently considered to be a threat. An unidentified fungal disease has caused &gt;90% mortality of tadpoles. Chytridiomycosis has also been detected in other species of frog at the breeding site, but its effects on Dusky Gopher Frogs are currently unknown. Temporary ponds altered to form more permanent bodies of water and stocked with fishes are no longer suitable breeding sites. The Dusky Gopher Frog is adapted to temporary wetlands and its larvae cannot survive the heavy predation of bass and sunfish commonly used to stock ponds. Introduction of predatory fishes into ponds for recreational use has caused declines in Gopher Frog (Rana capito) populations in Alabama (M. Bailey pers. comm., 1995). Construction of drainage ditches and firebreaks into ponds might also provide avenues for introduction of fish into breeding sites. High annual variation (5-37%) in intensity of egg mass mortality occurred during a three-year study (Richter et al. 2003). An additional undetermined amount of the egg mortality was due to predation by caddisfly larvae (Order Trichoptera, Family Phryganeidae) on the egg masses (Richter 2000). Gopher frog breeding sites have been degraded by roads that pass through or are adjacent to ponds. Erosion of unpaved roads adjacent to breeding sites may result in an influx of sedimentation from surrounding uplands during rainstorms. Off-road recreational vehicle (ORV) use can cause direct mortality of tadpoles and adults (J. Jensen, Georgia Department of Natural Resources pers. comm., 1996) and alter the quality of a breeding site. Vehicular traffic disrupts the contours of the pond floor, eliminates herbaceous vegetation, and can alter the hydrology of the site (L.V. LaClaire pers. obs., 1995). Loss of herbaceous vegetation from ORV usage could also discourage gopher frog reproduction, since egg masses are attached to stems of herbaceous vegetation (Bailey 1990; Palis 1995). ORV tracks have been documented within the Glen's Pond breeding site (G. Johnson, U.S. Forest Service pers. comm., 1994). Low reproductive potential might also represent a threat to this species' continued existence. Studies at the Mississippi breeding site suggest that females do not breed until two to three years of age and might breed only in alternate years and/or have only a single lifetime breeding event (Richter and Seigel 2002). Both larval and metamorph survival appears to be low (Richter et al. 2003). Variability in weather events can further reduce reproductive potential. Annual variability in rainfall, which influences how frequently and how long a pond is appropriate breeding habitat, can result in a number of years with complete reproductive failure (Richter et al. 2003). Studies of other species of ranid frogs (e.g., Berven and Grudzien 1990) suggest that many anuran populations show a strong meta-population structure. In meta-populations, adults are typically faithful to breeding sites but juveniles may disperse to new breeding areas before reaching maturity. As a result, reproductive failure at a single pond can be compensated for by recruitment at another site. Such a strategy also leads to a lower probability of genetic isolation and inbreeding (Stacey, Taper and Johnson 1997). Because there is only one known breeding site (until very recently), this population is highly susceptible to genetic isolation, inbreeding, and catastrophic events. Thus, the probability of extinction is higher than would otherwise be the case. Insecticides and herbicides might pose a threat. The aquatic larvae are likely most vulnerable to chemical changes in their environment. Adult gopher frogs are predaceous and could be affected by pesticides accumulated in their invertebrate prey. If a golf course is built in the drainage area of the breeding pond, as proposed, the chemicals used to maintain the golf course could pose a significant threat to the population.","Only one extant population was known as of 2000 (Richter et al. 2003). Historical records exist for three parishes in Louisiana, eight counties in Mississippi, and one county in Alabama. Recent surveys have been unable to document the continued existence of the species in Louisiana (Seigel and Doody 1992; Thomas 1996; J. Pechmann pers. comm. 2003) or Alabama (Bailey 1992b, 1994). The last observation of this gopher frog in Louisiana was made in 1967 (G. Lester, Louisiana Natural Heritage pers. comm., 1991) and in Alabama in 1922 (L√∂ding 1922). In 1987 and 1988, surveys of ponds in six Mississippi counties verified the presence of the species at only four sites in Harrison County (Crawford 1988). At three of the four sites, only one individual was observed. Subsequent to this work, surveys have documented the continued existence of only one population, represented by Crawford's fourth site in Harrison County. Based on census data collected 1996-2001, the population was estimated at 60-100 individuals (Richter and Seigel 2002; Richter et al. 2003). The population appears to be declining because of two fungal diseases, one of them chytridiomycosis.",Decreasing,"Historically, this species occurred on the coastal plain of the southern USA from eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi to the Mobile River delta in Alabama, USA. By 2003 it was only known from Glen's Pond in Desoto National Forest in Harrison County, Mississippi (USFWS 2000h; Young and Crother 2001). However, very recently individuals have been seen at two other sites: one calling male was seen at McCoy's Pond 50 miles east of Glen's Pond, and 50 tadpoles were collected from Mike's Pond, 20 miles west of Glen's Pond (Zippel 2005).

A Gopher Frog Recovery Team has since overseen conservation strategies that include pond water supplementation in dry years, habitat management, assisting larval survivorship, captive rearing, construction of an alternative-breeding pond, and treating infected larvae.

The Corn Creek population was extirpated as a result of an illegal introduction of non-native crayfish, with non-native goldfish possibly also contributing to the decline (USFWS 2004). Illegal introductions of nonnative aquatic species currently pose the most significant threat to the existence of this species.Long-term declines in spring flows due to groundwater pumping from areas surrounding existing poolfish habitat remain a threat to all the populations. Threats to water sources necessary for poolfish habitat have been minimized to the extent possible by the managing Federal and State agencies (USFWS 2004). However, it is likely that demands on the groundwater system to accommodate extensive human population growth and development in southern Nevada could threaten the future existence of the poolfish. Recent residential development in and around the native habitat at Manse Ranch continues to modify the native habitat, and future residential and commercial development in the Pahrump Valley may limit the available water resources and preclude the opportunity to re-establish a poolfish population in this location (USFWS 2004).Poolfish populations at Corn Creek and Shoshone Ponds Natural Area are vulnerable to vandalism (USFWS 2004).Jelks et al. (2008) categorized this species as Endangered, due to present or threatened destruction, modification, or reduction of habitat or range; other natural or anthropogenic factors that affect a taxon's existence, including impacts of nonindigenous organisms, hybridization, competition, and/or predation; and restricted range.","This species is represented by just a few occurrences (subpopulations and locations).Based on information from annual surveys utilizing mark and recapture methods, as well as informal visual surveys, the population at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park is currently the largest population of poolfish, estimated at 16,775 individuals in 2003 (see USFWS 2004).In the late 1990s, the population of poolfish at Corn Creek Springs was lost as a result of the effects of illegally introduced nonnative species. A new, isolated refugium for the poolfish was built at Corn Creek Springs in 2002, and that now small population is being rebuilt through reintroductions (see USFWS 2004).The third poolfish population at the Shoshone Ponds Natural Area historically remained stable since the 1980s, with only natural population fluctuations affecting its status; however, surveys in 2003 indicated a significant decrease in the population to less than 1,000 individuals (see USFWS 2004).

This darter has been collected from riffles and pools with Crystallaria asprella, it may also use areas of deeper pool and run habitats (Welsh et al. 2009).","The Elk River watershed is threatened with ongoing water quality degradation and habitat loss from activities such as coal mining, oil and gas development, siltation from these and other sources, inadequate sewage and wastewater treatment, and direct habitat loss and alteration through activities such as bridge construction. The impoundment of rivers in the Ohio River Basin, such as the Kanawha, Ohio, and Cumberland, has eliminated much of the species' habitat and isolated the existing population from other watersheds that the species historically occupied. Invasive species such as the diatom ""didymo"" have the potential to impact the Elk River and Diamond Darter habitat. The small size and restricted range of the remaining diamond darter population make it particularly susceptible to the effects of genetic inbreeding, as well as potential extirpation from spills and other catastrophic events. The species is vulnerable to over utilization for scientific purposes, however the significance of this threat has been reduced and can be further minimized through the administration of existing scientific collecting permit procedures. Existing federal and state regulatory mechanisms do not currently provide protections for the species or its habitat. Source: USFWS (2011).Extirpation in Ohio probably was due to increased silt loads which smothered sandy riffles, sand-bottomed pools, and extensive sand bars (Trautman 1981).Grandmaison et al. (2003) reported that siltation from current land-use practices is a major concern for conservation of Crystallaria in the Elk River drainage.","This species is represented by only one extant population (Welsh et al. 2009).Total population size is unknown; the species is rare.

Extent of occurrence is less than 1,000 sq km, area of occupancy is probably less than 500 sq km, and number of locations is one. Population size is unknown. Quantitative analysis calculated a 50 percent likelihood that the species could reach effective extinction within 20 years. Should the recent steep decline abate, the species would still easily qualify for Endangered status.","This euryhaline species inhabits open waters of bays, tidal rivers, channels, and sloughs; it rarely occurs in water with salinity of more than 10-12 ppt; when not spawning, it tends to concentrate where salt water and freshwater mix (salinity about 2 ppt) and zooplankton populations are dense (Moyle et al. 1989; USFWS 1993, 1996). Populations are concentrated mainly in the lower Delta and upper Suisun Bay after breeding (at least formerly). Adequate freshwater flows are needed to transport young to rearing habitat and to maintain rearing habitat in a favourable location (i.e., Suisun Bay). Spawning occurs in freshwater (sometimes in slightly brackish water), primarily in tidal dead-end sloughs and channel edgewaters. Eggs are demersal and adhesive. Larvae are buoyant and are carried downstream until they reach the mixing zone; area of the 2 ppt isohaline is an important rearing habitat for the young. See USFWS (1996) and Moyle (2002).","The decline may be attributable to the Delta Smelt's low fecundity and one-year lifespan, in combination with changes and fluctuations in the estuarine ecosystem. These changes and fluctuations include: reduction in outflows (water projects have allowed the intrusion of higher salinity water into the Delta, restricting the smelt's spawning and nursery areas to less favourable river channel habitat and making them more vulnerable to diversion in massive water project pumping plants); entrainment losses of larvae and adults to water diversion (attempts to rescue entrained smelt are probably largely unsuccessful, as these fishes are relatively fragile and often die when trapped and transported); high outflows during years with unusually high rainfall (flush smelt and their food resources out of the system; may make it easier for exotic species of copepods, clams and fishes to colonize); and changes in food resources (e.g., increased abundance of various species of exotic copepods, which could deplete smelt food resources and/or be more difficult for smelt to capture; the introduced clam, Potamocorbula, now abundant in Suisun Bay, may reduce availability of zooplankton to smelt larvae; the diatom Melosira, which is difficult for zooplankton to consume, sometimes becomes very abundant in the Delta) (Moyle et al. 1989; Moyle 2002; USFWS 1993, 1996).Hybridization (e.g., introduced Hypomesus nipponensis represents a potential threat through hybridization and/or competition; hybrids may be sterile but interbreeding may result in loss of Delta Smelt gametes).Water pollution (toxic substances from agriculture and urbanization) poses a threat of unknown degree (California Department of Fish and Game 1990, Moyle 2002).USFWS (Federal Register, 6 January 1994) listed the following activities as potential threats to critical habitat: sand and gravel excavation in river channels or marshes; diking wetlands for conversion to farmland and dredging to maintain these dikes; levee maintenance and bank-protection activities, such as riprapping, removal of vegetation, and placement of dredged materials on levees or banks; operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure; and bridge and marina construction.In reviewing the status of the Delta Smelt, USFWS (2004) made the following conclusions. Threats posed by extreme outflow conditions, the operations of the state and federal water projects, and other water diversions as described in the original listing (USFWS 1993) remain. Although some conservation measures have helped to ameliorate threats from adverse hydrological conditions and water diversions, it is unclear how effective these will continue to be over time based on available funding and future demands for water. Increases in water demands are likely to result in less suitable rearing conditions for Delta Smelt in Suisun Marsh, increased vulnerability to entrainment, and less water available for maintaining favourable habitat conditions. The importance of exposure to toxic chemicals on the population of Delta Smelt is highly uncertain. Threats posed by disease and predation have not been sufficiently studied, and their effects on Delta Smelt remain poorly known. Hybridization with Hypomesus nipponensis appears not to be a major threat. Existing regulatory mechanisms, particularly relating to water management and its affect on smelt habitat, are inadequate to assure the long-term existence of Delta Smelt in Suisun Bay and the Delta (USFWS 2004). The only new information concerning the Delta Smelt's population size and extinction probability indicates that the population is at risk of falling below an effective population size and therefore in danger of becoming extinct.An updated status review (USFWS 2010) yielded the following conclusions: Destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat poses a current and future threat. Operation of upstream reservoirs, increased water exports, and upstream diversions have altered the location and extent of the low-salinity zone, concentrating smelt in an area with competing fish species. Upstream reservoirs and the increased presence of the exotic submerged aquatic plant Egeria densa have also reduced turbidity levels in rearing habitat, which may reduce foraging efficiency. Predation is probably a low-level threat at this time. The continued decline in apparent abundance suggests that existing regulatory mechanisms, as currently implemented, are not adequate to reduce the threats to the species. Other threats includes entrainment by water export facilities and into power plant diversions, contaminants, and small population effects.","This species is represented by what can be regarded as one large occurrence (e.g., see Trenham et al. 1998).Total adult population size is unknown but is much larger than 10,000. Population size fluctuates and is very difficult to estimate (Moyle 2002).Historically, this was the most abundant pelagic fish in the upper Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary (Erikkila et al. 1950), and it remained abundant in California Department of Fish and Game trawl surveys in the Delta during the early 1970s (Stevens and Miller 1983, Moyle et al. 1989, Stevens et al. 1990). Now the species is much less numerous. In the early 1990s, the delta smelt was under a high degree of threat from the severe 1987-1992 drought. The species persisted in small numbers and rebounded to pre-decline levels in 1993, suggesting that recovery potential is fairly high. However, the subsequent decline in 1994, a critical water year, to a then all-time low annual abundance index, illustrates the high degree of threat that neutralizes gains in abundance that result from good water years. USFWS (2004) concluded that although there has been a general increase in numbers since the low point during a long period of drought in the 1980s and early 1990s, delta smelt abundance has not recovered to its pre-decline (prior to 1982) levels and that the overall trend is negative. USFWS (2010) found a continuing steep decline.Trend over the past 10 years or three generations (three generations is a shorter time period than 10 years) has been a steep decline. Apparent abundance has continued to decline since the significant decline that occurred in 2002; the most recent fall mid-water trawl abundance index (2009) was the lowest ever recorded (less than one-tenth the level of 2003) (USFWS 2010). A 2005 population viability analysis calculated a 50 percent likelihood that the species could reach effective extinction within 20 years (see USFWS 5-year review summarized in 2010).",Decreasing,"This fish is endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary, principally the upper Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (primarily below Isleton in the Sacramento River [probably formerly north to Sacramento], and below Mossdale in the San Joaquin River) and Suisun Bay (California Department of Fish and Game 1990, Moyle 2002). The species congregates in upper Suisun Bay and occurs in small numbers in larger sloughs of Suisun Marsh when river outflows are high (mainly March to mid-June); in 1994-1998, delta smelt were found mainly in Suisun Bay (Moyle et al. 1989, Moyle 2002). During periods of drought, the&#160;centre&#160;of abundance has been in the northwestern Delta in the channel of the Sacramento River, and the species is then rare in Suisun Bay (Moyle et al. 1989, Moyle 2002). During years with average or high outflow, smelt may concentrate prior to spawning movements anywhere from the Sacramento River near Decker Island to Suisun Bay (Moyle 2002). Spawning occurs in the sloughs and channels of the upper Delta (e.g., Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore sloughs) and in the Sacramento River above Rio Vista (Moyle 2002); in some years spawning also occurs north of Suisun Bay in Montezuma and Suisun sloughs and their tributaries or in the Napa River estuary (Federal Register, 6 January 1994; Moyle 2002). It is unclear if smelt in the Napa River are self perpetuating or if frequent recolonization from the Delta is necessary to maintain a population there (USFWS 2004). Larvae have been recorded from the Sacramento River as far north as its confluence with the Feather River (Wang 1991, cited in Federal Register 6 January 1994). Sometimes individuals are washed into San Pablo Bay, but permanent populations do not exist there (Moyle 2002).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The primary conservation need is recovery of natural processes in the Sacramento-San Francisco estuary, including outflow (Moyle 2002).Moyle et al. (1989) emphasized that present mechanisms that regulate freshwater flow through the Delta have been inadequate to protect Delta Smelt. They concluded that the key conservation action needed is to provide enough outflow through the Delta to ensure that the entrapment zone is located in Suisun Bay during March-May in all but the driest years; this zone should not be located outside Suisun Bay for more than two successive years; such a flow regime would also benefit other species such as the striped bass.

It also has been found in reservoirs. Available data suggest that habitats required for conservation include river channels and flooded, ponded, or inundated riverine habitats, especially those where competition from non-native fishes is absent or reduced (USFWS, Federal Register, 21 March 1994). Spawning occurs probably in spring over rocky substrates; spawning in reservoirs has been observed over rocky shoals and shorelines (USFWS 2002). Flooded bottomland habitats appear to be important growth and conditioning areas, particularly as nursery habitats for young (USFWS 2002).","Threats to the species include habitat modifications resulting from streamflow regulation, dams that function as movement barriers on main-stem rivers, competition with and predation by nonnative fish species, hybridization (possibly), and pesticides and pollutants (USFWS 2002). The significance of, and factors leading to, hybridization with other Gila species are unclear, and this factor is not regarded as an important threat at the present time (USFWS 2002). However, hybridization should be evaluated as Bonytails are released into the wild and populations become established (USFWS 2002).

In the Green River basin, this species has been virtually nonexistent in recent collections (Muth et al. 2000). The last observed large concentration of Bonytail occurred 1954 when about 500 adults were observed spawning over a gravel shelf in Lake Mohave, Arizona-Nevada (Jonez and Sumner 1954). Collections of Bonytail in Lake Mohave yielded at least 50 specimens in the 1970s and 1980s, but USFWS (2002) reported that only one Bonytail subsequently was captured there. Significant numbers of Bonytail were last captured in the Upper Colorado River Basin (lower Yampa River and Green River below the Yampa) in the 1960s and early 1970s, shortly after the closure of Flaming Gorge Dam. Since then, only a few single captures were recorded (all in the 1980s) in the entire Upper Colorado River Basin (USFWS 2002).Recent trend is unknown because so few Bonytails have been captured. Wild population probably is declining.",Decreasing,"Bonytails were formerly abundant throughout the Colorado River and its larger tributaries, including the Green River north to the reach now inundated by Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Wyoming and Utah, the Yampa and Gunnison rivers in Colorado, and the Colorado River in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and California), and probably also the San Juan River in New Mexico and the Gila and Salt rivers in Arizona (Lee et al. 1980, USFWS 1990, Muth et al. 2000). Documented records exist for Lake Havasu, Lake Mohave, and Grand Canyon in the Lower Colorado River Basin; and Lake Powell, the Colorado River (Cataract Canyon, Green River confluence, Utah; Black Rocks, Colorado), Gunnison River near Delta, Colorado, Green River (Gray Canyon, Utah; Dinosaur National Monument, Colorado and Utah; Hideout Canyon, Utah), and lower Yampa River, Dinosaur National Monument, Colorado), in the Upper Colorado River Basin (USFWS 2002).An unknown but small number of wild adults exist in Lake Mohave on the mainstem Colorado River of the Lower Colorado River Basin (i.e., downstream of Glen Canyon Dam, Arizona), and there are small numbers of wild individuals in the Green River and upper Colorado River subbasins of the Upper Colorado River Basin (USFWS 2002). USFWS (2002) listed only two locations (Lake Mohave on the Arizona-Nevada border and Lake Havasu along the Arizona-California border) where wild bonytails have been documented since 1990.As of the early 1990s, populations were being established in urban lakes in Tempe, on the Buenos Aires NWR, and at TNC's Hassayampa Reserve, all in Arizona; plans called for stocking of experimental populations into Arizona streams (Minckley and Deacon 1991).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Management actions needed include the following (USFWS (2002):Reestablish populations with hatchery-produced fish.Identify genetic variability of Bonytail and maintain a genetic refuge in a suitable location in the lower basin.Provide and legally protect habitat (including flow regimes necessary to restore and maintain required environmental conditions) necessary to provide adequate habitat and sufficient range for all life stages to support recovered populations.Provide passage over barriers within occupied habitat to allow unimpeded movement and, potentially, range expansion.Investigate options for providing appropriate water temperatures in the Gunnison River.Minimize entrainment of subadults and adults at diversion/out-take structures.Investigate habitat requirements for all life stages and provide those habitats.Ensure adequate protection from overutilization.Ensure adequate protection from diseases and parasites.Regulate nonnative fish releases and escapement into the main river, floodplain, and tributaries.Control problematic nonnative fishes as needed.Minimize the risk of increased hybridization among Gila spp.Minimize the risk of hazardous-materials spills in critical habitat.Remediate water-quality problemsProvide for the long-term management and protection of populations and their habitats beyond delisting (i.e., conservation plans).Information on Bonytail habitat requirements is limited, but the flow and temperature recommendations made for the other endangered native fishes in the Green River basin would presumably benefit any Bonytails that may remain in the system and would not limit their future recovery potential (Muth et al. 2000).",Nearctic,,False,False,Global,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

It seems to prefer shallow areas (0.5-1.5 meters deep) (Lee et al. 1980). Scoppettone et al. (2004) found that White River Spinedace in streams orient near the bottom but frequently move up in the water column to strike at drift items. Larvae occurred near the surface and in much shallower and slower water than that used by adults and juveniles. Flag Springs has swift to moderate flow. The most common aquatic plants in the habitat are watercress, pondweed, rush, and cattail. Surrounding vegetation is needed for shade and as habitat for insects upon which the spinedace feeds (Matthews and Moseley 1990).","Major threats to this species include competition with/predation by non-native fishes (e.g., Rainbow Trout, Largemouth Bass) and alteration of habitat associated with the use of springs for irrigation purposes (e.g., converting natural spring and marsh complexes into impoundments and canals and development of underground irrigation pipelines) (USFWS, Nevada Fish and Wildlife Office).Maintenance of self-sustaining populations of White River Spinedace within designated critical habitat will require considerable effort because Preston Big Spring and Lund Spring have been severely modified, and the water rights and land are in private ownership.Because of continued restrictions on restoring two critical habitats located on private lands, the species' distribution remains limited and it continues to have a high degree of threats and existing conflicts to recovery (USFWS 2010).","This species is represented by only one occurrence.As of 2007, approximately 2,500 individuals inhabited the Flag Springs complex (USFWS, Nevada Fish and Wildlife Office).

This population is no longer considered viable due to lack of documented reproduction (USFWS 2010).At the time of listing (1985), the last remaining populations were restricted to small remnants of historical habitats at Lund and Flag springs, representing less than 3 percent of the species' historical range (USFWS 1994). By the early 1990s, the Lund Spring population had been extirpated and there were only a few dozen individuals inhabiting a single 70-meter stream reach, with no obvious indication of recent recruitment (Scoppettone et al. 1992, USFWS 1994). After non-native fishes were eradicated in 1995 and spinedace were relocated downstream to lower Flag Spring (Scoppettone et al. 2004), the population rebounded to over 1,000 individuals (USFWS, Nevada Fish and Wildlife Office). The population subsequently fluctuated between 800 to 1,500 individuals, and by 2003 approximately 1,000 White River Spinedace inhabited the Flag Springs complex (Nevada Division of Wildlife March 2003 unpublished data). USFWS (Nevada Fish and Wildlife Office website, last updated in 2007), reported the population size as approximately 2,500 individuals inhabiting the Flag Springs complex.Extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, and population size have increased over the past 10 years (e.g., Scoppettone et al. 2004, USFWS 2010).",Increasing,"Historical range included the White River just below the mouth of Ellison Creek, Preston Big Spring, Nicholas Spring, Lund Spring, Arnoldson Spring, Flag Spring, Cold Spring, Indian Spring, and as far south as the White River 15 kilometres downstream from Flag Springs (USFWS 1994).

The White River Spinedace now occurs in the Flag Springs complex (consisting of three springs originating within 300 meters of each other) within the Kirch Wildlife Management Area; the three springs all flow into Sunnyside Creek. As of 2006, spinedace were able to move freely between each spring and their associated outflows and downstream into Sunnyside Creek (USFWS 2010).

Decline is primarily due to the effects of dams and introduced fish species.","Habitats required by adults in rivers include deep runs, eddies, backwaters, and flooded off-channel environments in spring; runs and pools often in shallow water associated with submerged sandbars in summer; and low-velocity runs, pools, and eddies in winter. Spring migrations of adult Razorback Sucker were associated with spawning in historic accounts, and a variety of local and long-distance movements and habitat-use patterns have been documented. Spawning in rivers occurs over bars of cobble, gravel, and sand substrates during spring runoff at widely ranging flows and water temperatures (typically greater than 14¬∞C). Spawning also occurs in reservoirs over rocky shoals and shorelines. Young require nursery environments with quiet, warm, shallow water such as tributary mouths, backwaters, or inundated floodplain habitats in rivers, and coves or shorelines in reservoirs. Source: USFWS (2002).Flooded lowlands and lower portions of tributary streams presumably served as resting-feeding areas during breeding season in the Green River basin (Tyus and Karp 1990). This fish is often associated with sand, mud, and rock substrate in areas with sparse aquatic vegetation, where temperatures are moderate to warm (Sigler and Miller 1963). It has been collected in flooded gravel pits along the Colorado River, Colorado, and from irrigation canals along lower Colorado River (juveniles, Marsh and Minckley 1989). In the nonbreeding season, adults were most common in shoreline runs and along mid-channel sand bars in the mainstream Green River, with average water depth of less than 2 m and average velocity of less than 0.5 m per second (Tyus and Karp 1989). Radio-tagged suckers reintroduced into the Gila River, Arizona, used both sand-bottomed, flat-water, main-channel habitats and quieter pools and eddies adjacent to stronger currents (see Minckley et al. 1991). Hatchery-reared suckers released into the San Juan River inflow of Lake Powell most often used shallowly flooded stands of salt cedar and, in some cases, cobbled shorelines (Karp and Mueller 2002). Limited data indicate that young tend to remain along shorelines, in embayments along sandbars, or in tributary mouths (see Minckley et al. 1991). In Lake Mohave, individuals were associated with inshore habitats except during the hotter months when they moved offshore possibly to avoid warmer water temperatures (Mueller et al. 2000).Spawning occurs most commonly near shore in streams over silty sand, gravel, or rock substrate at depths of up to about 6 m (often in water less than 0.6 m deep); known and suspected spawning sites in the Green and other upper-basin rivers all are in broad, flat-water segments (Minckley et al. 1991). Mature individuals often have been taken over or near coarse sand, or gravel or cobble bars, in flowing water. In reservoirs, spawning occurs on gravel bars swept clean by wave action; also along shorelines over mixed substrates ranging from silt to cobble (Federal Register, 21 March 1994). Spawning has been observed downstream from major impoundments, below Davis Dam and Hoover Dam (Mueller 1989). Larvae appear to remain in gravel until swim-up (see USFWS 1990); apparently they prefer the shallow littoral zone for a few weeks after hatching, then disperse to deeper waters (see Federal Register, 21 March 1994, p. 13375). Seasonally inundated flood plains provide favourable feeding areas for young.","Threats to the species include streamflow regulation, habitat modification, competition with and predation by non-native fish species, and pesticides and pollutants (USFWS 2002).Recruitment is very low (or absent) despite spawning and hatched larvae (e.g., in upper Green River basin). For example, no recruitment to reservoir populations was detected between 1963 and 1990 in the lower Colorado River basin, despite collecting with appropriate equipment (Minckley et al. 1991). Low recruitment results primarily from predation on larvae and juveniles by introduced fishes (Marsh et al. 2003). Competition with and predation by exotic crayfish may also be a problem in some areas (Lenon et al. 2002).Habitat changes resulting primarily from dam operations has greatly restricted the amount of suitable habitat; these detrimental changes include high winter flows, reduced high spring flows, altered river temperatures (Clarkson and Childs 2000), and reduced flooding (USFWS 1990).Natural recovery is limited by a paucity of spawning adults. Hybridization with other suckers is a potential problem in some locations (Tyus and Karp 1990, Minckley et al. 1991).See USFWS (1990) for many details on habitat changes that have affected this species.","This species is represented by just a few extant spawning populations. Total adult population size appears to be not more than a few thousand (perhaps fewer than or not many more than 5,000). The largest population is in Lake Mohave, where an ageing population of a few thousand adults (Marsh et al. 2003) is being enhanced by stocking of larger juveniles. The Green River subbasin population appears to only several hundred (fewer than 1,000) (USFWS 2002). Upper Colorado River subbasin population is very small, with no evidence of young since the 1960s (USFWS 2002). San Juan River contains only hatchery-reared stock that has survived and reproduced to some extent (USFWS 2002). It is estimated that there are more than 1,000 Razorback Sucker in the 60-mile reach of the lower Colorado River between Davis Dam and Lake Havasu, with evidence of reproduction (see USFWS 2002). Lake Mead contains an estimated 400 adults (late 1990s) (see USFWS 2002).Area of occupancy, number of subpopulations, and population size have declined dramatically compared to the historical situation. See Marsh and Minckley (1989), Minckley et al. (1991), USFWS (1997, 2002), and Marsh et al. (2003) for information on historical status, decline, present status, and threats.Population size is still declining. For example, the population in Lake Mohave (the largest remaining subpopulation) declined from 44,000 (also reported as 60,000) in 1991 to fewer than 3,000 in 2001 (Marsh et al. 2003). The population in the upper Green River basin was estimated at about 1,000 adults in the late 1980s (Lanigan and Tyus 1989); more recent data suggested a decline to about 500; population has been characterized as stable or declining slowly, with some evidence of recruitment (USFWS 1997, 2002). In the upper Colorado River, the number of Razorback Suckers captured has decreased dramatically since 1974 (USFWS 2002).",Decreasing,"This species' range historically included most of the Colorado River basin, from Wyoming and Colorado to Sonora and Baja California (Page and Burr 2011). Now it is much reduced in range and abundance. Currently the species is found in small numbers in the Green River (wild population being augmented), Yampa River (low numbers), White River (low number below Taylor Draw Dam), Duchesne River (small seasonal aggregations at mouth), upper Colorado River (low numbers), Gunnison River (wild population extirpated; being re-established through stocking), and San Juan River (wild population extirpated; being re-established through stocking); lower Colorado River between Lake Havasu and Davis Dam (spawned and produced larvae in early 2000s); reservoirs of lakes Mead and Mohave (population being augmented); in small tributaries of the Gila River sub-basin (Verde River, Salt River, and Fossil Creek; limited distribution of hatchery stocks; no self-sustaining populations); and in local areas under intensive management such as Cibola High Levee Pond, Achii Hanyo Native Fish Facility, and Parker Strip (USFWS 2002).Major known spawning areas in Lake Mohave include Cottonwood Cove, Arizona Bay, Six-mile Cove, and Eldorado Canyon (Minckley et al. 1991). An ongoing stocking program is attempting to enhance the number of suckers that reach maturity in Lake Mohave where few young fish escape predation by non-native fishes.Since the late 1980s, the Arizona Game and Fish Department has attempted to establish populations in the Verde and Salt rivers through stocking, but few fish survive. In the Upper Colorado River Basin, adults and larvae are widely distributed in the Green River basin, especially in the upper basin from the mouth of the Duchesne River upstream to the lower four miles of the Yampa River, rarely occurring upstream as far as the Little Snake River. Spawning has been documented in lower Yampa River near confluence with Green River and in the upper Green River (Tyus and Karp 1989). Adults overwinter in the Echo Park area of Dinosaur National Monument (Tyus and Karp 1989). A small reproducing population exists in the lower Green River. In the upper Colorado River, most suckers occur in the Grand Valley (mainstem Colorado River and Gunnison River, Colorado. A reproducing population occurs in an off-channel pond in the Colorado River near Grand Junction. A few have been found in the San Juan River above Lake Powell, and adults have been found in the San Juan and Colorado River arms of the lake (USFWS 1997). The species is currently considered extant in New Mexico, based on ongoing reintroduction efforts in the San Juan River Basin (D. L. Propst pers. comm. 26 October, 2000). The project started in 1995 and New Mexico Game and Fish documented reproduction in 1998 and 1999.Razorback Suckers were recorded in the late 1980s along the south shore of Lake Powell near the concrete boat ramp at Piute Farms Marina and near Bluff, Utah; the Lake Powell record apparently represented a spawning aggregation or staging prior to spawning elsewhere (Platania et al. 1991).See Minckley et al. (1991) for a detailed account of the historic and present distribution and abundance.",This species is not utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),Population maintenance depends on ongoing stocking of juveniles that are large enough to avoid predation by non-native fishes.Natural recruitment might be enhanced by appropriate management of floodplains that serve as important nursery areas.,Nearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Channel work for flood control in 1982 apparently rendered one area unsuitable for this species. Reservoir construction downstream could enable non-native fishes to invade logperch habitat.This species remains highly vulnerable to extinction and/or habitat destruction/degradation due to stochastic or human-induced events that degrade its habitat, including floods, drought, chemical spills, point-source contaminants, sewage spills, herbicides and pesticides, heavy metals, excess hormones and/or nutrients, and other factors (USFWS 2011).Localized drought, chemical spills, floods that significantly alter habitat, or other catastrophic events could affect all or part of the logperch's limited range. Long-term, chronic threats include changes in land use that result in excess siltation of channel bottoms, reduced water quality, altered hydrology, loss of riparian buffers, and/or increased contaminant loads (USFWS 2011).","This species is represented by a single occurrence (location, as defined by IUCN). Within the 55-km known range, the species has been observed at only 29 shoals since 1988. Individuals have been detected only once at 16 of these sites, and only two or three times at seven of the sites. At the other six sites (three upstream of the mouth of Perry Creek, one site between the mouths of Perry and Sumac Creeks, and two sites downstream of the mouth of Sumac Creek), the species has been detected on 4‚Äì10 occasions (Hagler et al. 2011).Total adult population size is apparently quite small. Catch per unit effort estimates conducted in the mid-2000s estimated the Conasauga Logperch population at less than 200 adults (Anna George, Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute, pers. comm., Nov. 2008, cited by USFWS 2011).The species is uncommon in its small range.

Adults and juveniles inhabit runs and quiet waters adjacent to riffles with sand and sand/gravel substrates (USFWS 2000). Adults are generally found in habitats with water depths of 0.15‚Äì0.43 m and velocities of 0.24‚Äì0.49 m per second, whereas juveniles select areas with slower and deeper water, and larvae are found in backwaters and stream margins which are often associated with growths of filamentous algae (USFWS 2000). Spawning occurs in swifter flowing water over beds of cobble or gravel (Matthews and Moseley 1990).","The Virgin River system has been negatively affected by agricultural and energy development, and the decline of the Woundfin has been due in part to habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation caused by associated dams, reservoirs, and water diversion. Completion of Quail Creek Reservoir in Utah in 1985 was followed by a substantial decrease in the abundance and area of occupancy of the Woundfin.Changes to flow patterns caused by dams and diversions have facilitated movement of red shiners upstream in the Virgin River (USFWS 1994). The non-native red shiner largely has replaced the Woundfin and has introduced the Asian tapeworm, which now parasitizes many of the remaining Woundfin (Heckmann et al 1986). Maintenance of a 26-kilometer red-shiner-free zone has required monumental management efforts, and the threat of red shiner expansion remains as prevalent today as it was in the late 1980s when red shiners became established in the upper river (USFWS 2008).The Woundfin inhabits one of the fastest-growing parts of Utah, and associated extensive water development is an ongoing threat (Minckley and Deacon 1991). Failure of a dike at Quail Creek Reservoir and a resulting flood of relatively enormous magnitude detrimentally affected the Virgin River Woundfin habitat (Hendrickson and Brooks 1991).Primary threats are competition and predation from non-native species (primarily Red Shiner) and degraded habitat conditions (reduced flow/high temperatures) (USFWS 2008). Causes for the most recent decline in Woundfin numbers was attributed to the following suite of environmental conditions: continued drought with summer temperatures exceeding behavioural thermal maximum and critical thermal maximum; runoff from burned portions of the drainage; and the input of sediment from behind the Quail Creek Diversion Dam (USFWS 2008).","This species is represented by very few occurrences (subpopulations) (only one if the Virgin River is regarded as a single metapopulation).Total adult population size is unknown.Surveys in the early 1970s found that the Woundfin was the most common native species, comprising about half (5,000 of 10,822) of the native fish collected (Cross 1978). It has declined greatly since then, with increases in the range and abundance of the red shiner. The species now occupies not more than 12 percent of the estimated historical range (USFWS 2000).Over the past 30 years, Woundfin have generally declined throughout their occupied range and critical habitat. They have been extirpated from the Lower Virgin River (i.e., from Beaver Dam Wash, perhaps from the Utah / Arizona State line, downstream to Lake Mead). Populations in Utah, particularly those upstream of the influence of red shiner (i.e., upstream of the Washington Fields Diversion), have persisted better than anywhere else (USFWS 2008).Distribution and abundance have declined over the past 10 years or three generations (three generations is roughly 10 years). In the past 20 years, Woundfin have been eliminated from at least 56 kilometers of designated critical habitat in the lower Virgin River, and abundance has declined to precariously low levels elsewhere (USFWS 2008).",Decreasing,"This species' historical range included the Colorado and Gila river basins in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, including at least the Colorado River from Yuma upstream into the Virgin River in Nevada and Utah, and the Gila River from Yuma to the confluence of the Salt River. No barriers or habitat considerations would have limited the species to this specific area, so it is likely that the historical range extended farther upstream in the Verde, Salt, and Gila rivers in Arizona (USFWS 2000).Preliminary sampling results collected in 2007 indicated that the wild Woundfin population was functionally extirpated throughout its designated critical habitat (140 stream-kilometres along the Virgin River) (USFWS 2008). Hatchery-raised Woundfin have been stocked in the upper Virgin River, and additional releases are planned in the future.In 1972, Woundfin were transplanted into four locations in the Gila River system, but populations were not established (USFWS 2008). In 1985, streams in the Gila River drainage (Hassayampa, Verde, San Francisco, and Gila rivers, and Tonto Creek) were identified as reintroduction sites, and the Gila River drainage was designated as a nonessential experimental population.

Spawns in headwater tributaries of the Muddy River, within 150 m of warm water spring discharge in water temperatures of 30‚Äì32¬∞C (Scoppettone et al. 1992).","Present status is due to: alteration of habitat by resort development, depletion or capping of headspring waters, and the introduction of exotic fish species (predators and competitors), which infest the wetlands downstream of dace-occupied springs. A potential threat is reduced spring discharge that may result from groundwater pumping along the Muddy River and elsewhere.In June 1994, a fire occurred at the Moapa National Wildlife Refuge and apparently caused a population decline (Scoppettone et al. 1998).Present threats include habitat loss and degradation from altered water flow, non-native predators and competitors, and habitat fragmentation from fish barriers built to prevent the spread of exotic fishes (barriers must be maintained until the threats from non-native fishes are eliminated) (USFWS 2009). Groundwater pumping and associated potential decrease in spring discharge remain a long-term threat (USFWS 2009).Fan palms pose a threat from increased fire probability, and Blue Tilapia is the primary threat among non-native fish species.","Before 1933, this species was regarded as common in 25 springs and up to 16 km of outflow streams and river channel. Recent studies found this species in low numbers only in restricted portions of three springs and in less than 3.2 km of spring outflow and river. Scoppettone et al. (1998) found Moapa coriacea in seven areas. USFWS (2009) reported that the species persists in several warm springs and associated outflow streams. With respect to primary threats, the entire range can be regarded as one location.In the mid-1980s, total adult population ranged from 2600 to 2800 (Scoppettone et al. 1992).

Population varied around 1,000 from 1997 to 2003, then increased to 1,296 in 2005 due to extensive habitat restoration, tilapia removal, and construction of fish barriers. By 2008 the population had dropped to about 450 (USGS Western Fisheries Research Center).USFWS (1990) categorized the status as ""stable.""

It is currently believed to be restricted to two riffle areas in Little Chucky Creek, a third order tributary of the Nolichucky River that drains a portion of the Ridge and Valley physiographic province. All of the specimens collected in the creek have been found in stream runs with slow to moderate current over pea gravel, cobble, or slab-rock substrates (Burr and Eisenhour 1994). Habitat of these types is sparse in Little Chucky Creek, and the stream affords little loose, rocky cover suitable for madtoms (Shute et al. 1997). It is notable that an intact riparian buffer occurs in the two riffles where chucky madtoms have been found (Shute et al. 1997). Intact riparian buffers may be required by the species. [from USFWS 2002]","Little Chucky Creek drains a highly agricultural watershed, and silt and agricultural chemicals have been implicated in the decline of other madtom species (Etnier and Jenkins 1980, cited by Shute et al. in press). At upstream sites extensive removal of riparian vegetation has occurred through the use of herbicides (Burr and Eisenhour 1994). The few available habitat patches in Little Chucky Creek are impacted by sedimentation and water quality degradation from agricultural activities (Burr et al. 2005). Other potential threats include impoundments and water withdrawal for irrigation (Shute et al. 1997). The Chucky Madtom is apparently restricted to two riffle areas in one stream and is therefore extremely vulnerable to extirpation from vandalism or random catastrophic events such as toxic chemical spills, drought, disease, or floods. Species that are restricted in range and population size are also susceptible to inbreeding depression and genetic bottlenecks. It is likely that the extant population is below the effective population size required to maintain long-term genetic and population viability without substantial human intervention. Overall, the USFWS believes that the potential demographic effects of inbreeding, limited species distribution, and low number of individuals pose the most significant threats to the chucky madtom. [primarily from USFWS 2002]The Dunn Creek watershed within the historical range is threatened by residential development and associated new infrastructure (e.g., roads, utilities, etc.) that contribute sediment and other pollutants to the stream or alter riparian areas (USFWS 2002). The effects of these types of threats will probably increase as human populations in these watersheds increase in response to human demands for housing, transportation, and places of employment (USFWS 2002). In particular, the areas surrounding Dunn Creek are becoming developed for new residential and vacation homes due to its proximity to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and other area attractions (USFWS 2002).","This species is represented by one known occurrence (subpopulation), which extends a few stream kilometers and may not be viable (Burr and Eisenhour 1994, Shute et al. 1997).

However, this species is very difficult to collect, and surveys may fail to detect small, localized populations (Shute et al. 1997).The inability to consistently locate individuals in known habitat suggests that the species is quite rare (Shute et al. 1997).

As such, these bees do not found their own nests, but instead, usurp the colonies and worker forces of other bumble bee species. To do this, a mated female enters the nest of another bumble bee species, kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and forcibly (using pheromones and/or physical attacks) ""enslaves"" the workers of that colony to feed her and her developing young. Since all of the resulting cuckoo bee offspring are reproductive (not workers), they leave the colony to mate, and the mated females seek out other nests to attack. Males of this species patrol circuits in search of mates. Before finding and invading a host colony, females feed directly from flowers. The adult food plants of this species include Aster, Cirsium, Echinacea, Helianthus and Solidago (Williams et al. 2014).Cuckoo bees often attack a broad range of host species, but some specialize in attacking the members of just one species or subgenus. Bombus variabilis (=intrudens) is recorded as breeding as a parasite of colonies of Bombus pensylvanicus (Williams et al. 2014): females usurp established colonies and lay eggs which the workers of the host colony then rear to adulthood. Its host species is associated with open fields and grasslands (Colla and Dumesh 2010).","Generally, bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are threatened by a number of factors including habitat loss, pesticide use, pathogens from managed pollinators, competition with non-native bees, and climate change (reviewed in Goulson 2010, Williams et al. 2009, Williams and Osborne 2009, F√ºrst et al. 2014, Cameron et al. 2011, Hatfield et al. 2012). Reduced genetic diversity resulting from any of these threats can be particularly concerning for bumble bees, since their method of sex-determination can be disrupted by inbreeding, and since genetic diversity already tends to be low in this group due to their colonial life cycle (i.e., large numbers of bumble bees found locally may represent only one or a few queens) (Packer and Owen 2001, Zayed and Packer 2005, Goulson 2010, Hatfield et al. 2012, but see Cameron et al. 2011 and Lozier et al. 2011).As this bee is a parasitic species, it is dependent on its host species throughout its large range in the United States. The main threat to this species is the significant widespread decline of the only known host species, Bombus pensylvanicus (Cameron et al. 2011), including the colour pattern known as B. sonorus. This Psithyrus species uses B. pensylvanicus as a host; it historically occurred in the northern part of B. pensylvanicus' range, which is where B. pensylvanicus has declined most severely. This is likely linked to the decline of suitable grassland habitat for the host species (Grixti et al. 2009). However, the lack of recent B. variabilis (= intrudens) records despite the presence of its host species indicates other threats may be involved. Alternatively, perhaps host abundances have dropped below a threshold required to sustain healthy populations of this species in the United States (Natureserve 2013). Regardless, B. varians (=intrudens) is likely vulnerable to environmental stressors such as climate change, habitat loss and pesticide exposure, however the extent of impact of these stressors is unknown, given the sparsity of recent information for this species.Natural wildfires and prescribed burning may benefit bees by creating open forage in otherwise unsuitable habitat. As such, the suppression of natural fires can result in habitat loss for bees and other grassland species, particularly in forested regions. In light of this, prescribed burning is frequently used as a conservation management tool to restore natural ecosystems (e.g., grasslands), increase biodiversity (particularly plant species), and control invasive species (e.g., Brockway et al. 2002, Hatch et al. 2002). However, depending on fire intensity, duration, season, frequency, and patchiness, prescribed fire may result in population loss for pollinators, particularly at sites where few individuals of a species exist (e.g., Swengel 1996). As such, both fire suppression and fire itself may threaten this species in some areas.","Several North American studies have found decline in the relative abundance and distribution of this species over time. For example, in a study of 56 sites across Illinois, comparisons between recent (2007) surveys and historic records (beginning in 1900) found that although B. variabilis (=intrudens) historically occurred in all geographic regions of the state, it was completely absent in recent surveys and museum collections (2000-2007) (Grixti et al. 2009). This species was last recorded in Illinois in 1980, and is now considered extirpated from the state (Grixti et al. 2009). A larger study considering over 69,000 bumblebee specimens collected from 1865-2010 from various institutions assessed changes in relative abundance and occupancy of 21 North American species and ranked their conservation status throughout their entire U.S. and Canadian ranges (Colla et al. 2012). Although this study considered a larger scale than previous studies, the species found to be declining range-wide were generally consistent with those found to be declining in regional studies. Of all North American bumblebees examined, B. variabilis (=intrudens) was found to exhibit the most decline, showing severe decline in both persistence and relative abundance. This species completely absent from all samples in the most recent time period (1991‚Äì2009), despite 94 historical records (Colla et al. 2012).We evaluated this species‚Äô spatial distribution over time across its North American range using a measure of change in the extent of occurrence (EOO) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield et al. 2014). We also assessed changes in the species‚Äô relative abundance, which we consider to be an index of abundance relevant to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012). For all three calculations we divided the database into historical (1805-2001, N=128,572) and current (2002-2012, N=74,682) records. This time frame was chosen to meet the IUCN criteria stipulation that species decline must have been observed over the longer of three generations or 10 years. Average decline for this species was calculated by averaging the change in abundance, persistence, and EOO. We used these measures of change between the recent and historic time periods to estimate the population trend that has occurred in the past 10 years, and to inform the application of an IUCN category. This analysis yielded the following results (see also the Supporting Information for Figure 1 - map of change in EOO over time; and Figure 2 - relative abundance trend):Current range size relative to historic range: 42.91%&#160;&#160;&#160; Persistence in current range relative to historic occupancy: 0.00%*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Current relative abundance relative to historic values: 0.00%*Average decline: 79.71%*There are no records of this species in North America in the last decade. Our analysis suggests that this species has declined in relative abundance consistently since the 1920s, making it one of the rarest in its range, and possibly extinct (Hatfield et al. 2014) throughout its range north of Mexico. The range size calculation reflects the difference in sampling effort between the historical, and the current sampling period, and recognizes that the lack of recent records may be a artefact of sampling. *The persistence and relative abundance measures do not reflect the population in Mexico and Central America. However, since the majority of this species' range occurs north of Mexico, and the range loss estimate is very conservative (before correcting for sampling bias, the range loss for this species is greater than 99%), we are still confident that this species meets the quantitative threshold for a Critically Endangered status.",Decreasing,"In North America, this species&#160;is found in the Eastern Temperate Forest and Great Plains region of the midwestern U.S., with scattered occurrences on the southeastern coastal plain, southern Texas, and southern Arizona (Williams et al. 2014).Bombus intrudens also&#160;occurs in Central America, including Mexico and Guatemala (Williams&#160;et al.&#160;2014).&#160;The ECOSUR database (2015) includes 133 recent (2009-2013) records of this species, mainly from Guatemala and southeast Mexico (Chiapas state), and few records from other Mexican states (Guerrero, Jalisco, Oaxaca and Veracruz). In addition, there are 21 Mexican records of this species from a number of collections with unavailable record information (Vandame, R. 2014, pers. comm).",This species is not used.,Terrestrial,"Actions should focus on conservation management of host species in North America as captive rearing of this species is likely not an option. Due to the lack of recent specimens across this species' large range,&#160;targeted surveys to locate extant populations are priority for this species.&#160;If located, any extant populations should be protected from habitat loss, pesticide exposure and pathogen spillover.Specific conservation and research needs for this species have not been identified.

235,North America,Marmota vancouverensis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,RODENTIA,MAMMALIA,SCIURIDAE,Marmota,vancouverensis,C1+2a(i),"Vancouver Island Marmot is listed as Critically Endangered because in 2016 it was estimated that there were between 90-130 individuals occurring in two subpopulations in the wild. Its area of occupancy is less than 10 km¬≤, and there has been extensive clear cutting of its forest habitat. A population reduction of greater than 30% over the past three years has occurred, indicating a larger population decline over the generation length (~ 4-5 years). Additionally both subpopulations have fewer than 50 individuals.","This species inhabits subalpine meadows between 900 and 1,400 m in elevation (Kruckenhauser et al. 2008). Subalpine herbaceous communities with steep slopes support the largest populations (Nagorsen 1987). Common tree species in these communities are Abies lasiocarpa, Tsuga mertensiana, and Chamaecyparis nootkatensis; shrubs and herbs include Vaccinium spp., Luetkea pectinata, Alnus sinuata, Erigeron peregrinus, Rhododendron albiflorum, Phlox diffusa, Anaphalis margaritacea, Aster foliaceus, Lupinus arcticus, and Pteridium aquilinum (Milko 1984). Preferred lush forb/grass meadows are relatively rare on Vancouver Island; they generally are restricted to steep, south-facing slopes where avalanches and snow creep inhibit the growth of trees (Nagorsen 1987). Fire also creates favourable meadow habitat on subalpine slopes. Most marmot occurrences are on south- and west-facing slopes (Bryant and Janz 1996). Colonies have also been found in coniferous forest, logging clearcut slash, road banks, and cleared ski runs. In fact, half of the world's M. vancouverensis were living in clearcuts in 1997, compared to about 25% in the mid-1980s and none prior to high elevation logging that began in the late 1960s. Individual marmots occasionally take up residence in valley-bottom gardens (Munro 1985).Marmots prefer areas with sufficient soil for burrowing, and with large rocks or stumps for burrowing under and for lookout sites. Burrows are usually below rocks in or near meadows. Young are born in underground burrows.&#160;M. vancouverensis is colonial. Colonies are relatively small and inhabit small habitat patches. Most are made up of one to three family units, and the average size before the young-of-the-year emerge is about eight individuals (Bryant 1990). Meta-populations of this species consist of a patchwork of colonies, each of which experiences periodic extinctions and recolonizations (Bryant and Janz 1996). Dispersal is a key ingredient of this pattern; the appearance of individual marmots in unusual habitats far from known colonies indicates that&#160;M. vancouverensis is capable of extensive dispersal through forested lands (Munro 1985). Year-to-year persistence of family groups has been measured at 43% in natural sites and at 13% in logging slash sites (Bryant 1990). Most mortality apparently occurs during hibernation. Survivorship varied dramatically from year to year in Bryant's (1990) study, but a small sample size prevented any accurate determination of a mean rate. Predation on M. vancouverensis has not been studied, but potential predators include Canis lupus, Martes americana, Gulo gulo, Felis concolor, Ursus americanus, Buteo jamaicensis, Aquila chrysaetos, Accipiter gentilis, and Bubo virginianus (Bryant 1990).&#160;Grasses and sedges are the most important food in early spring; forbs make up the bulk of the summer diet. Small fruits are also eaten. Hibernates from early October to early May.There appears to be sufficient habitat for Vancouver Island Marmots, however the distribution of habitat relative to dispersal may make some habitat relatively inaccessible to active Marmot colonies.","Invasive species pose a large threat to Marmot populations. The primary threats to this species include native predators, ecosystem modification arising from post-logging forest succession, and longer term predicted habitat loss associated with climate change.&#160;Logging activities adjacent to colonies have created temporarily attractive habitat to marmots and have undoubtedly resulted in an increase in marmot populations. Bryant (1990), however, feared that logging clearcuts may be deleterious in the long run; there is evidence that, although they provide attractive summer habitat, they offer poor conditions for successful hibernation. They may thus act as ""sinks"" preventing dispersing marmots from reaching adjacent mountain ridges (Bryant 1996). This would decrease genetic outcrossing as well as preventing former colony sites from being recolonized. More research is needed. Bryant (1990) concluded that the known population of M. vancouverensis is not viable using existing criteria.Bryant and Page (2005) concluded that predation was the proximate cause of recent declines in wild Vancouver Island marmot populations, that losses were highly concentrated in late summer, and that previous studies exaggerated the importance of winter mortality. We suggest that high predation rates were associated with forestry and altered predator abundance and hunting patterns.&#160;Habitat loss due to natural cycles and clear cutting of forests as well as an increase in predation present threats to this species, and has caused existing populations to be unstable (Kruckenhauser et al. 2008).","The small population size puts the Vancouver Island Marmot at risk of extinction (Jackson et al. 2015). Conservative estimates are 140-190 marmot in the wild, based on field counts. Bryant (2005) reported the following: ""Population counts began in 1979 and have continued, with variable coverage and intensity, until the present. Marmots expanded into new habitats created by clearcut logging of high-elevation primary forests during the 1980s; numbers increased to an estimated 300-350 individuals by 1986, with about half of these living in clearcuts (Bryant and Janz 1996). The temporary population expansion was followed by precipitous decline and near-extinction in the wild (Bryant 2000). Fewer than 130 marmots were known to be alive by 2004, including 93 in captivity and about 35 in the wild (unpublished minutes, Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Team, November 2004).""&#160;In 2007 it was estimated that there were only about 85 individuals remaining in the wild with about 162 individuals remaining in captivity (Kruckenhauser et al. 2008). Since 2000, 579 pups (45% female) have been weaned in the captive population, 43 marmots reside between the Calgary and Toronto Zoos. Release of captive bred marmots begin in 2003 and from 2003-2016 there have been 490 captive marmots released into suitable habitat (Jackson et al. 2015). Approximately 100 marmots released are monitored using transmitters each year.&#160;Since 1972, the species has been found at 47 sites on 15 mountains (Bryant and Janz 1996). However, only four occurrences are known to be extant.Population trends are difficult to determine because estimates of numbers and sizes of colonies before the 1970s are not available and only one or two relatively thorough censuses have been done (these only in the central part of the range). Numbers of adults were above average during the early 1980s and were reported as near or below average since 1990 by Bryant and Janz (1996). Recent data indicate a significant decline during the 1990s. Data for 1997 indicated a 60% decline in numbers during the past decade and a similar reduction in geographic range in the last several decades (Bryant et al. 2002).A thorough and systematic inventory of all of Vancouver Island, especially the western and northern mountains, is needed to determine the actual present status.",Decreasing,"This marmot is endemic to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada&#160;(Kruckenhauser et al. 2008). Historical and confirmed modern distribution records are confined to mountains in the central and southern part of the island, with occurrence in natural habitat typically at elevations of 900-1,400 m asl, although populations in clearcuts may extend to lower elevations. Occurrences are concentrated on a few mountain ridges in the Nanaimo-Cowichan Lake region of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Team 1990). There is some evidence that marmots have disappeared from some parts of their historical range, but huge areas of potential habitat have never been formally surveyed. Opinion is divided on the likelihood of discovering new, significant populations.",,Terrestrial,"It is listed as Endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act (23Jan1984) and by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) it is listed as Endangered (01 May 2000).

Marmots have now increased to two metapopulations (Jackson et al. 2015).&#160;Key marmot colonies should be protected by designation as Wildlife Management Areas or by landowner agreements. The draft recovery plan (Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Team 1990) states that ""current known population size and distribution, together with available genetic and demographic data, suggest that direct management may be required to reduce the vulnerability of the species to extinction.

236,North America,Bombus affinis,ANIMALIA,ARTHROPODA,HYMENOPTERA,INSECTA,APIDAE,Bombus,affinis,A2b,"Historically common and broadly distributed in the Upper Midwest and Eastern North America,&#160;Bombus affinis has recently experienced serious declines in relative abundance, persistence and distribution across its range. Despite dramatically increased&#160;awareness and survey effort for B. affinis, numerous regional studies have reported local extirpations and declines in this species (reviewed in Jepsen et al. 2013), and range-wide studies have found relative abundance declines up to 95% (Cameron et al. 2011a), and range losses of 70 to 87% in recent years (Colla et al. 2012, Cameron et al. 2011a). Consistent with these findings, our analysis found B. affinis has exhibited a 92.54% relative abundance decline over the past decade, suggesting a Critically Endangered Red List category for this species. Note that the Average Decline of 69.36% (based on relative abundance, persistence, and range loss) points toward an Endangered Red List category (very near the cut-off for Critically Endangered). Since the range loss detected in our analysis (45.32%) is much lower than that reported in other studies (87% in Cameron&#160;et al.&#160;2011a, considering only the U.S. range; 70% in Colla&#160;et al.&#160;2012, considering U.S. and Canada range), we elected to use the Relative Abundance Decline to estimate Past Reduction, rather than Average Decline. This species is listed as Endangered in Canada (COSEWIC 2010) and has been petitioned for Endangered Species Listing in the United States (Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013).&#160;Based on our recent analysis (Hatfield&#160;et al.&#160;2014), along with published reports of bumble bee decline and the assessors' best professional judgement, we recommend this species for the Critically Endangered Red List category at this time.&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;","Bombus affinis typically occurs close to or within woodlands (Williams et al. 2014). It has been documented in grasslands, marshes, agricultural landscapes and more recently from residential parks and gardens (Colla and Packer 2008, Colla and Dumesh 2010, Williams et al. 2014,&#160;reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013).&#160; Bumble bees, as a whole, are eusocial insects that live in colonies composed of a queen, workers and reproductives (males and new queens). Colonies are annual and only the new, mated queens overwinter. Although little is known about the overwintering habits of Bombus affinis, queens of other species frequently dig a few centimetres into soft, disturbed soil and form an oval shaped chamber in which she will spend the duration of the winter. Compost in gardens or mole hills may provide suitable sites for queens to overwinter (Goulson 2010). Queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. Bombus affinis&#160;is&#160;one of the earliest species to emerge in North America, with queens typically emerging from hibernation as early as March or April (Milliron 1971, Colla and Dumesh 2010,&#160;Williams et al. 2014,&#160;reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013).  In general, bumble bee nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles or cavities in dead trees. Nests of B. affinis have occasionally been observed above ground, but are usually one to four feet below ground in abandoned rodent nests or other cavities (reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013). Thus, nesting sites may be limited by the abundance of rodents. After establishing a nest, the bumble bee queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Colonies of B. affinis are considered large compared to other species of bumble bees, producing up to 1,000 workers throughout the season (Macfarlane et al. 1994). New queens and males are produced during the later stages of colony development, generally from mid-July or August to September in this species (Plath 1922, Milliron 1971, Macfarlane&#160;et al.&#160;1994). As B. affinis emerges early, but does not produce reproductives until late in the summer, this species may be particularly susceptible to stressors (Jepsen et al. 2013).  To meet its nutritional needs, B. affinis&#160;‚Äì like other bumble bees -&#160;requires a constant supply of flowers that bloom throughout the duration of the colony life cycle (approximately April to September). Nectar is a critical source of carbohydrates for bumble bees, and pollen provides essential protein. The amount of pollen available to bumble bee colonies during the growing season directly affects the number of queens that can be produced (Burns 2004). This, in turn impacts future bumble bee population levels. Bombus affinis probably needs floral resources to be located in relative close proximity to its nest sites, as studies of other bumble bee species indicate that they routinely forage within less than one kilometre of their nests (reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013). Bombus affinis is a short-tongued species (Williams et al. 2014), typically found on open flowers and those with short corollas rather than flowers with deep corollas. Colla and Dumesh (2010) suggest that&#160;B. affinis&#160;is likely dependent upon woodland spring ephemeral flowers, since this bumble bee emerges early in the year and is associated with woodland habitats. This species&#160;is reported from a wide variety of wild plants including&#160;Aesculus, Agastache, Dalea, Eupatorium, Helianthus, Impatiens, Lonicera, Monarda, Prunus, Solidago, and&#160;Vaccinum (Williams&#160;et al.&#160;2014). See Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;(2013) for a list of additional plant species used by&#160;B. affinis.&#160;","The primary threats attributed to the severe decline of Bombus affinis include pathogen spill-over from commercial to wild bees; habitat loss due to agriculture and development; pesticide use; and climate change (reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013).&#160;Reduced genetic diversity, which can be a result of declining, isolated subpopulations caused by any of the aforementioned factors, likely also threatens this species (reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013).&#160;The spillover of the microsporidian parasite Nosema bombi from commercial to wild bumble bees has been hypothesized as a cause of the sudden, rapid decline of B. affinis and three other closely related North American bumble bees ‚Äì B. franklini, B. occidentalis, and B. terricola (Thorp and Shepherd 2005, Evans et al. 2008, Colla and Packer 2008, Cameron&#160;et al.&#160;2011a, Jepsen et al. 2013). This hypothesis is supported by the timing, speed and severity of the population declines of B. affinis and its close relatives. The major decline of species in the subgenus&#160;Bombus was first documented in&#160;B. occidentalis, as Nosema nearly wiped out commercial hives, leading to the cessation of commercial production of this species. Wild populations crashed simultaneously and the closely related&#160;B. franklini&#160;has also declined; it has not been found since 2006 despite extensive surveys. Cameron et al. (2011a) found a significantly higher prevalence of N. bombi in declining North American bumble bee species (B. occidentalis and B. pensylvanicus). Bombus affinis was also examined in this study, but the sample size was so low that the data were excluded from the statistical analyses. However, the authors note that the available data show that this species followed the same infection trend of the other declining species, with infected individuals collected at four of five sites, and infections detected in seven of the 14 individuals collected. Additional pathogens of significance to B. affinis include the protozoans Crithidia and Apicystis bombi, the mite Locustacarus buchneri, the nematode Sphaerularia bombi, and RNA viruses (see Jepsen et al. 2013 for details).Habitat loss and degradation due to agriculture and development are also likely to have attributed to B. affinis decline, by limiting&#160;access to sufficient food, nesting sites, and overwintering sites (Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013). Agricultural intensification is primarily blamed for the decline of bumble bees in Europe (Goulson et al. 2008), and may also pose a significant threat to bumble bees in the United States. Bombus affinis historically occupied the grasslands of the Upper Midwest and Northeast, which have largely been lost or fragmented by agricultural conversion and urban development, or transformed by fire suppression, invasive species and livestock grazing. Increases in farm size and changes in technology and operating efficiency have led to many practices that are detrimental to bumble bees, including loss of hedgerows, weed cover and legume pastures. The widespread application of the herbicide glyphosate in conjunction with increased planting of genetically modified crops that are tolerant to glyphosate has reduced the availability of wildflowers in agricultural field margins (Pleasants and Oberhauser 2012, Morandin and Winston 2005). The decline of B. affinis and other bumble bees in Illinois from 1940-1960 coincides with a period of major agricultural intensification in the Midwest (Grixti et al. 2009).Pesticides are used widely in agricultural, urban and even natural areas across B. affinis‚Äô range, including many known to have both lethal and sublethal toxic effects on bumble bees (see Jepsen et al. 2013). Foraging bumble bees can be poisoned by pesticides when they absorb toxins directly through their exoskeleton, drink contaminated nectar, gather contaminated pollen or when larvae consume contaminated pollen. As bumble bees nest in the ground, they may be uniquely susceptible to pesticides used on lawns or turf. Any application of pesticides can threaten bumble bees, but pesticide drift from aerial spraying can be particularly harmful. Neonicotinoids, an increasingly ubiquitous class of systemic insecticides used in corn and soy production, along with numerous other crops and ornamental plants, pose a unique threat to B. affinis. Colla and Packer (2008) suggested that neonicotinoids may be one of the factors responsible for the decline of this species, since the use of this class of insecticides began in the U.S. in the early 1990s, shortly before the decline of this bee was noticed. Numerous studies have found that field-realistic exposure to neonicotinoids can have direct lethal impacts to bees (Mommaerts&#160;et al&#160;2010, reviewed in Hopwood et al. 2012), as well as a variety of sublethal impacts, including reduced colony growth and queen production (Whitehorn&#160;et al.&#160;2012), reduced brood production (Laycock&#160;et al.&#160;2013), reduced drone production (Mommaerts et al. 2010), impaired foraging behavior (Gill&#160;et al.&#160;2012, Gill and Raine 2014, Morandin and Winston 2003), longer foraging times (Mommaerts et al. 2010) and reduced food storage (Al-Jabr 1999). Additional insecticides and herbicides of significant threat to B. affinis are reviewed in Jepsen et al. (2013).Climate change may also pose a significant threat to the continued survival of the rusty patched bumble bee. Climatic changes that are expected to have the most significant effects on bumble bee populations include: increased temperature and precipitation, increased drought, increased variability in temperature and precipitation extremes, early snow melt and late frost events. These changes may lead to increased pathogen pressure, decreased resource availability (both floral resources and hibernacula) and a decrease in nesting habitat availability due to changes in rodent abundance or distribution (Cameron et al. 2011b). Changes in the distributions of plants visited by bumble bees have been correlated with a changing climate (Forrest et al. 2010, Inouye 2008), which can cause phenological asynchrony between bumble bees and the plants they use (Memmott et al. 2007, Thomson 2010, Kudo et al. 2004). Early spring is a critical time for bumble bees since that is the time when the foundresses emerge from hibernation and initiate nests. After the fourth-warmest winter on record for the U.S. (2012), a rusty patched bumble bee queen emerged from hibernation in Wisconsin in March (Jepsen et al. 2013). Prior to this observation, the earliest recorded queens of this species from any region were recorded as emerging in April. Since bumble bees are generalist foragers, they do not require synchrony with a specific plant, but asynchrony can lead to diminished resource availability at times that are critical to bumble bee colony success. For example, as the climate in the Rocky Mountains has become warmer and drier in the past 30 years, researchers have observed a mid-season period of low floral resources, a change which can negatively impact pollinators (Aldridge et al. 2011). Reduced genetic diversity, which could be a result of declining, isolated subpopulations caused by any of the aforementioned factors, likely also threatens this species. Isolated patches of habitat may not be sufficient to support bumble bee populations (Hatfield and LeBuhn 2007, √ñckinger and Smith 2007), and populations of bumble bees existing in fragmented habitats can also face problems with inbreeding depression (reviewed in Jepsen et al. 2013). Cameron&#160;et al.&#160;(2011a) found that several declining bumble bee species are associated with low genetic diversity. Reduced genetic diversity can be particularly concerning for bumble bees, since their method of sex-determination can be disrupted by inbreeding, and since genetic diversity already tends to be low in this group due to the colonial life cycle (i.e., large numbers of bumble bees found locally may represent only one or a few queens) (Packer and Owen 2001, Zayed and Packer 2005,&#160;Goulson 2010, Hatfield&#160;et al.&#160;2012, but see Cameron&#160;et al.&#160;2011a and Lozier&#160;et al.&#160;2011).&#160; For additional details on threats to Bombus affinis and extinction risk, see the recent Endangered Species Act Petition for this species (Jepsen&#160;et al. 2013).","A number of studies, both local and range-wide, have shown a significant reduction in the range and relative abundance of this historically common species (reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013).&#160;Range-wide declines:&#160;A 2007-2009 field survey of more than 16,000 bumble bees from throughout the U.S., compared to collections of more than 73,000 historical bumble bee specimens, revealed that the historic range of B. affinis has contracted by an estimated 87% (Cameron et al. 2011a). This same study concluded that the relative abundance of B. affinis has declined by 95%; the species was only detected at low numbers in three Illinois locations and one Indiana location in the recent survey (Cameron et al. 2011a). A separate analysis of nearly 45,000 eastern bumble bee records from museum collections and contemporary surveys considering both Canada and the U.S. concluded that B. affinis has undergone a greater than a 70% range decline (persisting in less than 30% of re-sampled historically occupied 50 x 50 km grid cells throughout its United States and Canada range). The relative abundance of B. affinis &#160;from 1991-2009 was 87% less than its relative abundance in collections from &lt;1931-2000 (Colla et al. 2012). Similarly, a 2004-2006 study of approximately 9,000 bumble bees from 28 sites where&#160;B. affinis&#160;historically occurred in southern Ontario, plus 15 sites within the bee‚Äôs historic range in eastern North America, found that this species significantly decreased in relative abundance between the 1970-1973 and 2004-2006 survey periods (Colla and Packer 2008). In fact, only a single bee of this species was detected in the recent survey period, despite numerous reports that the species was historically common (Colla and Packer 2008). In the Northeastern United States, a long-term study of relative abundance changes of the entire regional bee fauna (based on &gt;30,000 museum records over a 140-year period),&#160;found&#160;B. affinis&#160;to be one of three bees (out of 438 species) that have exhibited a rapid and recent population collapse (Bartomeus&#160;et al.&#160;2013).Regional declines:&#160;In addition to range-wide declines, numerous regional studies have found local extirpations and declines in relative abundance and distribution in this species (reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013). For example, in a study of 56 sites across Illinois, comparisons between recent surveys and historic records of&#160;B. affinis&#160;revealed that the distribution of this species has decreased by nearly one third in that state since 2000, with only 67% of its pre-2000 distribution remaining (Grixti et al.&#160;2009). In Indiana, a multi-year survey of more than 880 bumble bees found just 25&#160;B. affinis&#160;specimens out of 217 (12%) in 2001, two out of 451 (0.004%) in 2002, and zero out of 553 in 2003 (reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013). In Minnesota, a survey of 464 bumble bees at Long Lake Regional Park found 98 rusty patched bumble bee individuals in 1994-1995, whereas surveys during the summers of 2007 and 2008 at the same park found no&#160;B. affinis&#160;among&#160;the 593 bumble bees recorded (reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013). Since 2011,&#160;B. affinis&#160;has been found in nearby parks, although in very small numbers (10 out of 3,235 bumble bees recorded between 2011 and 2014; E. Evans&#160;pers. comm. 2014).&#160;In New York, a 2003 survey including over 1,261 bumble bees failed to find any members of this species, despite this species historically considered ‚Äúmoderately abundant‚Äù in the state, and well represented in historical collections from the region (Giles and Ascher 2006). A study by Colla and Packer (2008) of two sites in southern Ontario comparing a recent collection of nearly 1,200 bumble bees to a historical collection (Macfarlane 1974) of &gt;3,600 bumble bees from the same locations revealed that the rusty patched bumble bee had been extirpated from both sites, despite the fact that it comprised approximately 14% of the 1970s collection. Similarly, P. Williams reported that the rusty patched bumble bee was formerly abundant in Toronto, Ontario in 1983 but was not seen during regular surveys in the Toronto area from 2003 to 2008 (reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013). In Maryland, a sample of nearly 1,000 bumble bees on the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge from 2002 to 2007 found a single&#160;B. affinis&#160;specimen in 2002, and none since, despite this species being numerous in collections in the 1980s in this area. In the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee, where B. affinis&#160;was once abundant, this species has not been seen since 2000. In North Carolina, surveys of spring queens consistently found this species from 1995 to 2001, yet between 2002 and 2007, no queens of this species were found, despite the detection of other bumble bee species (reviewed in&#160;Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013). In Virginia, a recent survey of bee populations at 17 sites detected just one B. affinis&#160;among nearly 35,000 bees&#160;collected and examined in the study (Smithsonian Science 2014).We evaluated this species‚Äô range-wide spatial distribution over time using a measure of change in the&#160;extent of occurrence (EOO; see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield et al. 2014). We also assessed changes in the species‚Äô relative abundance (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), which we consider to be an index of abundance relevant to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012). For all three calculations we divided the database into historical (1805-2001, N=128,572) and current (2002-2012, N=74,682) records. This timeframe was chosen to meet the IUCN criteria stipulation that species decline must have been observed over the longer of three generations or 10 years. Average decline for this species was calculated by averaging the change in abundance, persistence, and EOO.&#160;We used these measures of change between the recent and historic time periods to estimate the population trend that has occurred in the past 10 years, and to inform the application of an IUCN category.&#160;This analysis yielded the following results (see also the graph in Supplementary Material of relative abundance and map of change in EOO over time): Current range size relative to historic range: 54.68% Persistence in current range relative to historic occupancy: 29.77% Current relative abundance relative to historic values: 7.46% Average decline: 69.36%  The relative abundance graph of this species over time illustrates that the relative abundance of this species in the past decade is lower than any other decade (see Figure 1 in Supplementary Material). The most severe decline has been relatively recent ‚Äì since the early 1990s ‚Äì despite active searches throughout its historic range, described above. Note that the range loss detected in our analysis (45.32%) is much lower than that reported in other studies (87% in Cameron et al. 2011a, considering only the U.S. range; 70% in Colla et al. 2012, considering U.S. and Canada range). For a graph and map of relative abundance and range changes of this species over time, see the Supplementary Material.",Decreasing,"Historically, Bombus affinis&#160;was broadly distributed in the Northeastern United States and adjacent Canada, in the Eastern Temperate Forest and Boreal Forest regions, north to southern Quebec, Ontario, and Maine;&#160;south in a narrow band along the Appalachian Mountains to the northeast corner of Georgia, and west to the margin of the Great Plains in eastern North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa (Williams et al. 2014).&#160;Known records are at elevations from sea level to c. 6,000 feet (Jepsen&#160;et al.&#160;2013).&#160;In recent years, this species has declined severely across the Northeast, and recent records are mostly from the Midwest and southern Ontario, with very few individuals seen each year (Williams&#160;et al.&#160;2014). Our understanding of the current distribution of the rusty patched bumble bee has been greatly informed by a number of research studies as well as a citizen monitoring effort that began in 2008 to specifically target this species (Xerces Society 2014). Since 2000, one or more B. affinis individuals have been reported in the following states and provinces: Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Ontario, Tennessee,&#160;Virginia, and&#160;Wisconsin &#160;(Jepsen et al. 2013,&#160;Xerces Society 2014). The presence of this species is uncertain in the great majority of the states and provinces where it once occurred.For a graph and map of relative abundance and range changes of this species over time, see the Supplementary Material.",,Terrestrial,"Survey Needs:&#160;Once very common in eastern North America, B. affinis&#160;has recently undergone a dramatic decline in abundance and distribution, and is no longer present across much of its historic range. In order to better understand the causes and extent of this species‚Äô decline, as well as the conservation needs of remaining subpopulations, additional comprehensive surveys of this species at historic and potential sites are needed throughout its range. Management Needs: All known and potential sites of this species should be protected from pesticides, habitat alteration, grazing, and other threats that can interfere with the habitat requirements of this species (availability of nectar and pollen throughout the colony season, underground nest sites, and hibernacula).&#160;Note that any conservation efforts that benefit&#160;B. affinis are also likely to benefit&#160;to benefit B. bohemicus (formerly considered B. ashtoni), a social parasite of B. affinis and B. terricola that is also in serious decline in the North American part of its range&#160;(e.g. Bartomeus et al. 2013).",Nearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
237,North America,Bombus suckleyi,ANIMALIA,ARTHROPODA,HYMENOPTERA,INSECTA,APIDAE,Bombus,suckleyi,A2bc+3b,"According to our analysis, this western North American species has experienced rapid declines in relative abundance in recent years (Hatfield et al. 2014). The decade by decade relative abundance regression shows a gradual decline since the 1940s, and the relative abundance regression over just the past 50 years is highly significant (R-squared value of nearly 1; showing a continued steep decline). If we project the 50 year relative abundance regression into the future, it falls below the x-axis in the next 10 years. Notably, this species' regression mirrors that of B. occidentalis, a primary host. Both the past decline in relative abundance (90.11% over the past 10 years) and predicted future decline in relative abundance (based on 50-year regression) justify a Critically Endangered listing, using criterion A2be + A3b. Note that the range and persistence of this species have also declined, however, since some historic sites have not been re-sampled and since we only have records of this species in approximately six general localities for the current time period, we were not comfortable using those measures of decline. Based on the above calculations and trends, along with published reports of bumble bee decline and the assessors' best professional judgement, we recommend this species for the Critically Endangered Red List category at this time.","Bombus suckleyi is a cuckoo bee, a term used for a specialized lineage of bumble bees (subgenus Psithyrus) that has lost the ability to collect pollen and to rear their brood. As such, these bees do not found their own nests, but instead, usurp the colonies and worker forces of other bumble bee species. To do this, a mated female enters the nest of another bumble bee species, kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and forcibly (using pheromones and/or physical attacks) ""enslaves"" the workers of that colony to feed her and her developing young. Since all of the resulting cuckoo bee offspring are reproductive (not workers), they leave the colony to mate, and the mated females seek out other nests to attack. Males of this species patrol circuits in search of mates. Before finding and invading a host colony, females feed directly from flowers. The adult food plants of this species include ""Aster"", Chrysothamnus, Cirsium, and Solidago&#160;(Williams et al. 2014).&#160;Cuckoo bee nesting occurs exclusively in the nests of other bees. They often attack a broad range of host species, but some species specialize in attacking the members of just one species or subgenus.&#160;Bombus&#160;suckleyi&#160;has been recorded&#160;in nests of bumble bees in six different subgenera, but the most common association were with the subgenera&#160;Pyrobombus&#160;and&#160;Bombus, and the only nests in which&#160;B. suckleyi&#160;adults were produced were those of&#160;B. occidentalis&#160;(reviewed in&#160;Thorp et al. 1983).&#160;As such,&#160;B.&#160;suckleyi has been documented breeding as a parasite of colonies of Bombus&#160;occidentalis,&#160;and has been recorded as present in the colonies of B. terricola,B. rufocinctus, B. fervidus, B. nevadensis, and B. appositus&#160;(Williams et al. 2014).","The recent steep declines in relative abundance exhibited by this cuckoo bee are probably due to indirect threats (e.g., disease, decline in habitat) resulting in loss of hosts&#160;(Hatfield et al. 2014, Williams et al. 2014).&#160;This species is an obligate nest parasite of other bumble bees. Some of these bees, particularly B. occidentalis&#160;and B. terricola, are also experiencing dramatic declines (Evans et al. 2008), which is likely driving the declines of this species. Additional direct threats that may be impacting this species&#160;include&#160;pesticide use, habitat loss, pathogens from managed pollinators, competition with non-native bees, and climate change (reviewed in Goulson 2010, Williams et al. 2009, Williams and Osborne 2009, F√ºrst et al. 2014, Cameron et al. 2011, Hatfield et al. 2012). Reduced genetic diversity resulting from any of these threats can be particularly concerning for bumble bees, since their method of sex-determination can be disrupted by inbreeding (Goulson 2010, Hatfield et al. 2012). Note that Cordes et al. (2012) found this species&#160;exhibited high prevalence of the&#160;microsporidium Nosema bombi (25%), although the sample size was low (four individuals).","This species is apparently declining in some parts of its range, presumably linked to declines of some of its hosts (Williams et al. 2014). We evaluated this species‚Äô spatial distribution over time using a measure of change in the extent of occurrence (EOO; see Figure 3 in the Supplementary Material) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield et al. 2014). We also assessed changes in the species‚Äô relative abundance (see Figures 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Material), which we consider to be an index of abundance relevant to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012).

238,North America,Epinephelus striatus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PERCIFORMES,ACTINOPTERYGII,EPINEPHELIDAE,Epinephelus,striatus,A4bd,"This species is widely distributed in the greater Caribbean where it inhabits coral and rocky reef habitat. It is highly-valued by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range, and heavy fishing pressure has caused severe declines in most countries where it was previously naturally abundant. It is especially susceptible to rapid population declines when heavy fishing effort occurs on the large seasonal spawning aggregations that the species forms at the same sites each year. Due to overfishing, more than 30 of the known 50 aggregations across its range have disappeared (ceased to form), and the size of most aggregations have been reduced by 90% or more. Based on landings data and observations of spawning aggregations, population declines of about 80% have occurred in Mexico since the early 1980s, 80% in the Bahamas since the late 1980s, 90% in Puerto Rico since the 1980s/mid-1990s and 80% in Cuba since the late 1970s. Similarly severe declines, but where quantitative data are not available, have also been confirmed within approximately the same time period from Bermuda, the continental U.S. (south Florida), the Dominican Republic, Belize, Honduras, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. At least one exception is in the Turks and Caicos where fishing effort has been relatively low. Conservation actions aimed at reducing fishing or completely banning fishing for Nassau Grouper have been established in many countries, some for well over a decade, but insufficient enforcement and low compliance in many areas has prevented population recovery, and even allowed further declines to occur. Although, signs of some recovery have been reported from protected aggregation sites in the Cayman Islands and the Virgin Islands. Additional protection for the Wider Caribbean was recently conferred when the Nassau Grouper was added to Annex III of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) protocol in&#160;March 2017. Under this environmental treaty, most countries within its range are now legally-bound to properly regulate exploitation levels so as to maintain/recover populations. Based on the decline in spawning aggregations (60%) over the past 36 years (1980-2016, two generation lengths) and the likelihood that the population will continue to decline&#160;into the future (though likely at a slower rate than 20 years ago) due to insufficient fisheries management and continued fishing pressure, an exponential regression was applied to calculate the decline over three generation lengths (1980-2031), resulting in a 73% decline.&#160;However, as the size of the spawning aggregations has also substantially declined over this time period, it is highly likely that this is an underestimate, and the global population will decline by more than 80% over the three generation length time window that includes both the past and the future. For example, a conservative estimate of 10,000 individuals per aggregation in the 1980s and 3,000 individuals in 2016 would result in an overall population decline of 95% over the three generation length time window (1980-2031). Therefore, this species is listed as Critically Endangered A4bd. Recommended conservation priorities include establishment of protection of spawning aggregations and remaining populations, improvement of fishing regulation enforcement and implementation of regional management strategies that includes monitoring of aggregation status. Further research is needed on the formation of aggregations, reproductive output and to determine the status of lesser-studied aggregations.&#160;The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","This species prefers clear water with high relief coral reefs or rocky substrate (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). Early-stage juveniles inhabit inshore habitats including macroalgal clumps, seagrass beds and coral reefs (Eggleston 1995, Dahlgren 1998, Claydon and Kroetz 2007). It occurs to a depth of at least 140 metres, but individuals have been recorded to regularly descend to depths of 255 metres during spawning season.&#160;This species exhibits highly synchronized seasonal migrations to specific sites, typically located on outer reef drop-offs,&#160;where hundreds to tens of thousands of individuals aggregate to spawn (Starr et al. 2007).&#160;Migrations by individuals to spawning aggregations can exceed 200 km in one season (Bolden 2000, Dahlgren et al. 2016).&#160;Individuals may spend many weeks away from their home reefs during the spawning season, but spend a relatively limited time on the actual spawning site (Dahlgren et al. 2016).&#160;The species is functionally gonochoristic (Sadovy and Colin 1995).Sexual maturity is reached at about 4-5 years of age and a total length of 55 cm (Cushion 2010, Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013), though mature individuals from 39 to 46 cm total length have been reported in some studies (Claro et al. 1990, Aguilar-Perera 2004). According to a study conducted in the Cayman Islands on a population&#160;that has experienced relatively low fishing effort historically, longevity is about 29 years (Bush et al. 1996, 2006).&#160;Elsewhere, individuals have been aged to nine years in the Virgin Islands (highly exploited population;&#160;Olsen and LaPlace 1979), 12 years in northern Cuba, 17 years in southern Cuba (Claro et al. 1990) and 21 years in the Bahamas (Sadovy and Colin 1995).&#160;Sadovy and Eklund (1999) estimated&#160;generation time (average age of parents in the population) to be 9-10 years, but this is now considered to be likely an underestimate of its natural, pre-exploitation generation length. Therefore, the generation length is adjusted as follows from the assessment conducted in 2003. Based on a longevity of 29 years, age of first maturity of five years,&#160;and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski&#160;and Bellwood&#160;(2006), one generation length is estimated to be 17 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species, particularly heavy fishing on spawning aggregations. Although this species also inhabits rocky reefs, these are unlikely to be able to compensate for the loss of quality coral reef habitat. Between 1970-2011 (41 years), an overall 59% decline in coral cover was directly observed in the Caribbean, which was caused by anthropogenic stressors, Diadema antillarum decline, and coral disease (Jackson et al. 2014). It has also been identified as a prey item of the invasive Lionfish, with only juveniles being consumed (Morris and Akins 2009, Green et al. 2012). Lionfish may also compete with Nassau Grouper for reef shelter (Raymond et al. 2015).","Within its range, this species was naturally abundant in areas with large shelf platform habitat, such as Belize, the Bahamas, Cuba and others of the Greater Antilles, and less abundant in areas such as continental South America (e.g., Colombia and Venezuela; Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2017). There&#160;is evidence that there is strong genetic differentiation among Nassau Grouper subpopulations in the Caribbean region (Jackson&#160;et al. 2014).A summary of population status and trends in Table 1 of the Supplementary Information. During the first U.S. survey of the fishery resources of Puerto Rico, this species was noted as a common and very important food fish, reaching a weight of 50 lbs (22.7 kg) or more (Evermann 1900). In 1970, it was still a common shallow water species landed in Puerto Rico (Thompson 1978), the Virgin Islands, Cuba, Belize and elsewhere. Data on all&#160;known spawning aggregation sites&#160;have been collected&#160;and are collated in the Science and Conservation of Fish Aggregations (SCRFA) database&#160;(Sadovy de Mitcheson&#160;et al. 2008). In the past, aggregations were estimated to consist of 10,000 to 30,000 and up to 100,000 individuals (Lavett-Smith 1972; Olsen and LaPlace 1979; Colin&#160;et al. 1987; Fine 1990, 1992; Carter&#160;et al. 1994; Sadovy 1997). Aggregations still reported to exist as of 2007 had greatly declined due to overexploitation and contained only 100 to rarely 3,000 individuals, with declines ongoing since then (Sadovy de Mitcheson&#160;et al. 2008, Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;Over the past 40 years, widespread overfishing has occurred for this species in most countries across its range, with many populations now commercially non-viable. Due to intense fishing effort during spawning season, the size of aggregations has severely declined (from 10,000-100,000 individuals per aggregation to 100-3,000 individuals; greater than 90% decline), and the number of known individual aggregations has been reduced from at least 50 to less than 20 (a 60% decline; Sadovy de Mitcheson et al. 2008, Sadovy de Mitcheson et al. 2012).Underwater surveys and fishery data indicate that abundance is very low in almost all areas as compared to historical levels (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013). Underwater surveys conducted between 2003-2013 that are collated in the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) database show very low density and sighting frequencies in about 20 countries except the Turks and Caicos, Cayman Islands and parts of the Bahamas. Depending on the country, subpopulations are likely to either be stable (e.g., the U.S.) or in decline (e.g., Cuba, Belize, Puerto Rico), and despite conservation measures in several countries, there has been very limited to no recovery of overexploited populations. Several countries where fishing pressure has also been high, but where quantitative data are not available or only anecdotal reports exist (e.g., Jamaica), are inferred to have experienced declines at the same level as countries with quantitative data (e.g., the Bahamas).&#160;Based on the decline in spawning aggregations (60%) over the past 36 years (1980-2016; two generation lengths) and the likelihood that the population will continue to decline&#160;into the future due to insufficient fisheries management and continued fishing pressure, an exponential regression was applied to calculate the decline over three generation lengths (1980-2031), resulting in a 73% decline.&#160;However, as the size of the spawning aggregations has also substantially declined over this time period, it is highly likely that this is an underestimate, and the global population will decline by more than 80% over the three generation length time window that includes both the past and the future. For example, a conservative estimate of 10,000 individuals per aggregation in the 1980s and 3,000 individuals in 2016 would result in an overall population decline of 95% over the three generation length time window (1980-2031).Bermuda:&#160;Fishery landings in Bermuda were once dominated by grouper and snapper before their populations severely declined (Burnett-Herkes and Barnes 1996). In 1975, Nassau Grouper comprised 16% of the total grouper catch by weight, but declined to less than 1% of the catch by 1989 (Bannerot&#160;et al.&#160;1987, Report of the Commission of Inquiry Bermuda 1991). According to fisher interviews, all four known historical aggregations no longer formed and had probably crashed by 1981 (Bannerot&#160;et al. 1987, Luckhurst 1996). Despite subsequent protection, the fishery remains commercially non-viable (B. Luckhurst pers. comm. 2012).&#160;U.S. continental:&#160;The fishery for this species in the continental U.S. has been closed since 1992 and possession is prohibited (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). Despite these measures, spawning aggregations, including in the Dry Tortugas off Florida, have not recovered (Ault&#160;et al.&#160;2013).&#160;Mexico:&#160;According to fisher interviews, the large aggregations on Alacranes Reef off Mexico have been exhausted by overfishing and spawning activity has not been documented at all in recent years (Aguilar-Perera and Tuz-Sulub 2012). A historically large aggregation of about 1,000-15,000 individuals also disappeared off Mahahual, Mexico in 1996 (Aguilar-Perera and Aguilar-Davila 1996, Aguilar-Perera 2006). Surveys conducted since then indicate that the aggregation has not recovered (Aguilar-Perera 2014). According to fishers, another aggregation south of Playa del Carmen at Punta In√° was also extirpated during the early 1980s (Sosa-Cordero et al. 2009). An aggregation of about 2,000 individuals remains off Punta Gavil√°n in southern Quintana Roo (Medina-Quej et al. 2004, Aguilar-Perera et al. 2009, Fulton et al. 2016). Only five out of the 28 spawning aggregations along the Mexican Caribbean coast mentioned by fishers&#160;during interviews have been scientifically validated (Aguilar-Perera et al. 2009). An aggregation of at least 1,000 individuals&#160;was recently confirmed in the Sian Ka‚Äôan Biosphere Reserve (Fulton et al. 2016). Aggregate annual grouper landings in the Mexican Caribbean declined from 19,200 kg in 1998 to 4,000 kg in 2005, which is a period of about seven years (Aguilar-Perera et al. 2009, Sosa-Cordero et al. 2009).&#160;Bahamas:&#160;The population of Nassau Grouper in the Bahamas was one of the largest across its range. It has been a historically important component of Bahamian fisheries which primarily targeted spawning aggregations (Colin 1992) and the first and largest ever reported aggregation (30,000 to 100,000 fish) was documented in Bimini by Lavett-Smith (1972). To date, at least 31 aggregation sites&#160;have been reported (Sadovy de Mitcheson 2012), and 23 have been confirmed by direct observation or catch monitoring (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). In the 1970-1980s, aggregations ranged from hundreds to tens of thousands of individuals (Lavett-Smith 1972, Colin 1992).&#160;By the late 1990s to early 2000s, the population in the Bahamas was likely fully exploited to overexploited and aggregations were significantly reduced in size (Ehrhardt and Deleveaux 2007, Cheung&#160;et al. 2013).&#160;Reported annual landings from 1994 to 2011 declined by about 83% (650 tonnes to 113 tonnes). In addition to landings, mean body size of individuals in the catch has also declined since the 1990s and the proportion of Nassau Grouper in the catch declined from 10% to 4% from 1994 to 2009 (Cheung et al. 2013, Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;Landings of this species in the Bahamas declined by 86% since 1997&#160;(18 years), and despite fishery management measures, recovery has not occurred (Sherman&#160;et al.&#160;2016). Underwater reef surveys also recorded declines in numbers of observed Nassau Grouper over time.&#160;In 1992, over 20 spawning aggregations were&#160;being exploited across the Bahamas (NMFS 1992, R. Thompson pers. comm). The current status of many of these is unknown largely due to the lack of survey work in recent years: only four have been reported in recent scientific literature (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;Underwater surveys and fisher interviews conducted during the spawning season of 2013 at the aggregation site originally described by Lavett-Smith (1972) failed to find any sign of Nassau Grouper (Erisman et al. 2014). Diver and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in January 2002 around Long Island in the Bahamas at a known historically large aggregation site found no more than 28 individuals per survey and no spawning behaviour was observed (Gascoigne 2002, D. Eggleston pers. comm. 2014). Interviews with local fishers further indicated that spawning aggregations no longer occurred in the area (D. Eggleston pers. comm. 2014). The aggregation at High Cay was also reported to consist of an order of magnitude fewer spawners than its historical size (Gascoigne 2002, Ehrhardt and Deleveaux 2007). Hydroacoustic surveys conducted at High Cay recorded&#160;10,523 kg of fish in 1999, 9,300 in 2000 and 12,857 in 2001, although the reliability of this method has not been validated. Dive surveys conducted at this site in 2000-2001 found no evidence of an aggregation (Carleton Ray et al. 2000, Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;A recent study of genetic structure in the Bahamas showed that this species continues to support mostly high levels of genetic diversity with no evidence for geographic population structure and there is significant, but weak, genetic differentiation in Nassau Grouper throughout the Bahamian archipelago. Analyses of the last 1,000 generations indicate a pronounced historic decline in Bahamian Nassau Grouper that appears to pre-date anthropogenic fishing activities. There is additional evidence that population bottlenecks have occurred in several sites (Sherman et al. 2016).Turks and Caicos:&#160;This species is highly valued by the dive tourism and restaurant industries in the Turk and Caicos. Fishing pressure has been relatively low historically and the population appears to be healthy (Rudd 2003, Vo et al. 2014), although effort to supply local markets has recently increased (Dept. of Environment and Coastal Resources Turks and Caicos Islands 2008).&#160;Cuba:&#160;Historically, this was among the most important finfish species landed in Cuban fisheries, yielding some of the highest catches anywhere within its geographic range (Claro et al. 2001). Fishing pressure increased notably after 1959, with landings reaching 1,700 metric tonnes in 1963 and declining thereafter. The majority of landings were taken from spawning aggregations in the Sabana-Camag√ºey Archipelago&#160;(Claro and Lindeman&#160;2003). Until 1969, some of this catch was obtained from the Bahamas shelf.&#160;Landings data, which have been collected monthly since the 1960s, indicate a sharp decline occurred after 1969 partly due to the closure of the fishery in Sabana-Camaguey and&#160;targeting of spawning aggregations (Claro&#160;et al. 2001, 2009). Despite some protective management, a sudden collapse occurred in the late 1970s. Overall finfish landings gradually increased between 1962 and 1998 presumably due to increasing fishing effort, but Nassau Grouper declined steeply (Claro and Lindeman&#160;2003, Claro et al. 2009, Sadovy de Mitcheson et al. 2008). By 2008, only a few spawning aggregations remained viable off Cuba (Claro et al. 2009). The species is still captured by recreational fishers, but the population cannot support a viable commercial fishery. According to landings data and spawning aggregation studies, the population in Cuba is suspected to have declined by more than 80% over the past 30 years (three generations) (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014).Dominican Republic:&#160;This species is primarily captured in the trap fishery in the Dominican Republic (Munro and Thompson 1983). Landings have not been reported from the Dominican Republic for many years, and the species appears to have been severely depleted in local waters. Poaching by Dominican vessels in Bahamian waters for this species has been reported.Continental South America:&#160;This species occurs in continental South America, but aggregations have not been reported, and landings are no longer significant (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).Belize: Historically this species was extremely abundant in Belize (Craig 1966, Paz and Grimshaw 2001). However, many aggregations have been severely reduced, such as at Mexico Rocks, Rise and Fall Bank and Caye Glory (Paz and Grimshaw&#160;2001). The aggregation at Caye Glory reportedly supported tens of thousands of individuals and catch once exceeded an estimated 30,000 fish during just one spawning season (Craig 1966). In the late 1960s, grouper catches reached two tons per day at Caye Glory, but a survey conducted in January of 2001 recorded just 21 fish and fishermen caught only nine fish over four days (Heyman and Wade 2007). At least 15 spawning aggregation sites are known from Belize, and regular surveys of 14 of them indicate that only a few hundred to a few thousand fish remain today (Burns Perez and Tewfick 2016). All these aggregation sites have undergone dramatic declines in fish abundance over the past two decades and despite some protective measures that have reduced fishing effort on these aggregations, recovery does not appear to be occurring. Northeast Point off Glover‚Äôs Reef Atoll, which is one of the last viable (larger) spawning aggregations of Nassau Grouper in Belize, has varied in abundance with peaks of more than 3,000 individuals in 2001, 2005 and 2010, but generally declined by over 85% to 450 individuals in 2015. This decline coincides with the occurrence of illegal fishing in the area (Burns Perez and Tewfik 2016).Honduras and Nicaragua: This species is commercially exploited in&#160;Honduras and Nicaragua, but catch data are not available. Imports of this species into the U.S. from these countries, as reported by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, have declined since the 1990s. In Honduras, it appears likely that catch of Nassau Grouper has diminished since 2005 (Box and Bonilla 2008, Arrivillaga 2011). A two-year fishery survey conducted in the Bay Islands of Honduras reported the occurrence of immature Nassau Grouper individuals in the artisanal fishery in east Roat√°n and Guanaja (Gobert et al. 2005). Nassau Grouper landings in the Bay Islands increased until the late 1980s to early 1990s before declining by 2003 due to uncontrolled fishing of spawning aggregations in the 1990s (Box and Bonilla 2008). For example, an aggregation near Guanaja was reduced from approximately 10,000 fish to less than 500 in two years and appears to have been eradicated in the early 1990s (Fine 1990, 1992), but has not been surveyed since. Fishers have reported the existence of several other spawning sites, but their condition is unknown. The aggregation at Banco Campiche is still likely to exist in part due to its inaccessibility (Box and Bonilla 2008). Anecdotal accounts from fishers as well as reductions in exports of Nassau and Red Grouper over the past few decades also indicate population declines have occurred (Box and Bonilla 2008, Canty and Box 2015).Lesser Antilles:&#160;Little is known of the status of this species in the islands of the Lesser Antilles, and reported catches are generally low (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).Jamaica:&#160;Fishing effort in Jamaica increased significantly with the advent of motorized boats and mechanized gears, which led to lower catch rates of all reef fish and the disappearance of some species, including the Nassau Grouper, from multispecies catches (Stevenson 1981). Fishery surveys conducted in the early 1970s in Jamaica recorded a catch per unit effort of 1.4 to 1.7 kg of Nassau Grouper per hour (Munro 1983).&#160;An underwater survey of reef fishes in Jamaica in 1986 revealed no groupers (Koslow et al. 1988), and by 1989, Nassau Grouper were rarely caught (Sadovy 1997). Its current status in Jamaica is not well-understood.Cayman Islands:&#160;Catches of Nassau Grouper in the Cayman Islands have declined since 1996 due to overfishing (Whaylen et al. 2004, Bush et al. 2006). However, according to surveys conducted on several spawning aggregations, this species&#160;may still be relatively abundant in the Cayman Islands, which is also one of few places within its range where the fishery is effectively managed (Patengill-Semmens and Semmens 2003). Surveys conducted from 2003 to 2013 recorded 1,857 Nassau Grouper individuals during 3,746 surveys (density index 1.7, sighting frequency 49.6%) in the Cayman Islands (REEF 2013). Five&#160;aggregation sites are confirmed in the Cayman Islands, with one off western Little Cayman likely to be the largest remaining aggregation (in terms of fish numbers) throughout its global range. This aggregation is still considered healthy despite two years of heavy fishing pressure; during 20 days of fishing in the 2001 and 2002 spawning season, approximately 4,000 fish were taken (Whaylen&#160;et al. 2004). Pre-fishing abundance for this aggregation was estimated at over 7,000 fish (Bush et al. 2006). According to studies conducted between 1987 and 2001, three of the Cayman Island aggregations were considered overfished with catch in the low hundreds and continuing to decline (Bush et al. 2006). The Little Cayman east end site was abandoned by fishers in 1993 when the aggregation ceased to form.&#160;Following the re-discovery of the spawning aggregation in Cayman Brac, catch was in the low thousands during the initial years, but it has declined drastically in the past six years. Based on a mark-recapture study conducted in Cayman Brac, fishermen were capturing 15-20% of the spawning population outside the spawning season, which indicates that the Nassau Grouper population may continue to decline even with a closure of the fishery during spawning season (B. Semmens pers. comm. 2012).Puerto Rico:&#160;This species once dominated catches in Puerto Rico from the 1950s to 1970s, but began declining in the 1980s and by 1988-1989 was rare and represented only 2% of grouper landings and 0.2% of all demersal fish species (Sadovy 1993, Sadovy and Eklund 1999, PRDNR 2012). By 1990, it was considered commercially non-viable (Matos-Caraballo 2008).&#160;In Puerto Rico, landings of this species are available for the 17 year period of 1998-2011, landings declined from a high of 19,085&#160;lbs in 1998 to 260 lbs in 2011, which represents a 99% decline over a 13 year period (Matos-Caraballo 2012; Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information).U.S. Virgin Islands:&#160;By 1981, Nassau Grouper had practically disappeared from local fishery catches in the Greater Antilles (CFMC 1985), and by 1986, it was considered commercially non-viable in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico (Bohnsack et al. 1986). Its current status in this area is poorly known. The Nassau Grouper fishery collapsed in the USVI in the late 1970s (Olsen and LaPlace 1979), and no significant spawning aggregation formed afterwards. One aggregation in the 1970s contained an estimated 2,000-3,000 individuals (Olsen and LaPlace 1979), but is no longer viable today. Fishermen have reported a possible recurrence of an aggregation south of St. John (D. Olsen pers. comm. 2011) and dive surveys conducted in 2001-2004 indicate that an aggregation may be re-forming at Grammanik Bank south of St. Thomas (Nemeth et al. 2006, Kadison et al. 2010). Further work conducted in 2004-2006 documented some increased settlement/recruitment in nearshore habitats in both St. Thomas and St. John (Nemeth et al. 2006).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western Atlantic from South Carolina, south along the U.S., Bermuda, the Bahamas, in the Gulf of Mexico from the Florida Keys, the Flower Garden Banks, southwestern Texas and Tuxpan, Mexico along the northern Yucatan to northwestern Cuba, throughout the Caribbean Sea, and along the South American coast to Venezuela (Hickerson et al. 2008, Robertson and Van Tassell 2015). It does not occur in Brazil (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Moura 2001). Its depth range is 0-255 metres.","This species is highly-valued by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range and is traded on the international level in some areas. It is also valued for domestic trade&#160;as well as&#160;dive ecotourism. It is taken by handline, longline, fish traps, spear guns and gillnets (Sadovy and Eklund 1999).",Marine,"Conservation strategies for this species vary widely by country, and include a total ban on take, fishing restrictions and area/temporal protection for spawning aggregations (Garcia-Moliner and Sadovy 2008).&#160;In March 2017, the Nassau Grouper was added to Annex III of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) protocol, which is a legally binding regional environmental treaty for the Wider Caribbean region. This confers some regional protection for the species with most countries within its range being signatories except Mexico. For species listed under Annex III, exploitation is authorized but must be regulated so as to maintain populations at an optimal level. However, historical issues with low compliance and insufficient enforcement lessens the potential for in-place fishing regulations to allow populations to recover in many countries. Furthermore, even areas that have enacted effectively-enforced protection for a decade or more have documented only minimal to no recovery of populations. Some countries have established marine protected areas (MPAs) based on the localities of spawning aggregations. It has been raised successfully in a hatchery, but not at a commercial scale. Although removing fishing effort on aggregations is a very important conservation action for this species, focusing protection only on spawning aggregations is likely to be insufficient, and migratory routes should also be considered (Dahlgren et al. 2016). According to Sadovy de Mitcheson et al. (2012) conservation priorities are as follows: (1) prevent overfishing of spawning aggregations; (2) protect sub-adult fish capture by establishing a minimum size limit at or above the size of sexual maturation; (3) protect remnant populations from fishing; (4) improve enforcement of fishery closures and address illegal, unmonitored and unregulated trade; (5) implement regional management strategies where the SPAW&#160; protocol might be applicable; (6) decisions may be needed in countries with remaining viable populations of Nassau grouper as to whether this species should be retained for food security or export trade or conserved for tourism and reef health. A precautionary and regional approach to management of remaining Nassau Grouper populations is essential to reduce the further declines (Sadovy de Mitcheson 2016). Further research is also needed on formation of aggregations, individual spawning frequency, reproductive output in small versus large aggregations, update surveys of lesser-studied historical aggregations and establish regular monitoring of aggregations.In U.S. federal and state waters, which includes Puerto Rico (since 2004) and the Virgin Islands, there has been a total ban on fishing for Nassau Grouper since 1992. Three spawning aggregation sites in the Bahamas - High Cay and two sites off eastern Long Island - were protected by law in 1999. Fishing for Nassau Grouper was also banned throughout the Bahamas in 2000. However, enforcement has been mostly lacking (N. Nuttall pers. comm.). Currently, there is a fishing and sales ban from December to February. It has been recommended that fishing effort in the Bahamas be reduced to 2001 levels to avoid further overexploitation (Cheung et al. 2013). In 1997, the Mexican fishery authority banned fishing of Nassau Grouper during spawning aggregation season (December to February; Aguilar-Perera et al. 2009), but this regulation has since disappeared with a change in the law. There has been a one-month ban on grouper fishing in Mexico since 2005, and in 2014, this ban was extended to two months (Aguilar-Perera 2016). In the Mexican Caribbean, several important spawning sites are located within MPAs (e.g., Xcalak Reef National Park and Sian Ka‚Äôan Biosphere Reserve; Medina Quej et al. 2004, Fulton et al. 2016). Under the ‚ÄúRefugios Pesqueros‚Äù (Fishery Refuges) initiative, the Mexican fishing authority (CONAPESCA) also designated several no-take areas based on the request of fishing organizations with civil support (Diario Oficial de la Federaci√≥n 2012).&#160;In Belize, fishing on&#160;most Nassau Grouper aggregations has been banned since 2002, with all&#160;thirteen known sites protected since 2012. In addition, there is&#160;a four month closed season and catch size limits&#160;(Burns-Perez and Tewfik 2016).&#160;In the Cayman Islands, gear has been restricted to line-fishing only and fishing during spawning season in three main 'grouper holes' has been permitted only for residents since 1978 (P. Bush pers. comm. 2001). In 2003, fishing was closed at all known spawning sites for a period of eight years with an extension in 2011 for another eight years. Numbers of individuals in at least one aggregation have increased since (Department of Environment 2011, Heppell et al. 2012). In August of 2016, the Cayman Islands government enacted a comprehensive set of regulations aimed at Nassau Grouper that represent the most progressive set of management actions throughout its range. These actions include: (1) All take, possession, or sale of Nassau Grouper is prohibited during spawning season from December through April (2) When take is permitted (May through November), only fish between 16""-24‚Äù can be kept and no more than 5 per fishing vessel per day (3) Spearfishing is prohibited. Grouper fishing is prohibited in the Dominican Republic during spawning season and a quota system was introduced in Cuba (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). In Bermuda, Nassau Grouper fishing has been banned since 1996 and there are several no-take MPAs, but the population has made no appreciable recovery (B. Luckhurst pers. comm. 2012).",,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

It is known from seven interlinked spring sites, which are presumed to be fed by the same groundwater source. The major threats lie in disturbance of the micro-habitats containing the food sources and&#160;change in water flow patterns. The population of the species is known to fluctuate in numbers, both over the year as well as between years. Usually these fluctuations happen across the entire spring sites.The species is assessed as Critically Endangered on the basis of the small range, interlinked sites (forming one location), and ongoing threats from changing precipitation patterns impacting the recharge of the groundwater feeding the springs.","This freshwater gastropod is largely found on the microbial mats (bacteria, algae, shed deciduous leaves) floating on the surface water of the springs as well as the sides of the sulphurous thermal water pools.&#160; It also may cling to emergent rocks and woody debris. Most of the snails for most of the year are found at or close to the thermal spring origin with numbers declining substantially with distance from the up-welling or hot water seepage.","The major threats lie in disturbance of the micro-habitats containing the food sources and&#160;change in water flow patterns (Lepitzki and Pacas 2007, amended 2010). &#160;The small areas used as resting, feeding, and egg deposition places for the freshwater snails, have a range of recorded threats since 1996 from disturbance due to recreational bathing, tourists placing hands in the water, restoration of the habitats during re-building, and loss of the water supply.Many thermal springs in BNP are highly modified and regulated, and are subject to impacts by visitors. The stoppage, redirection, and reduction of thermal water flows can have a significant impact on snail populations. Soaking and swimming, trampling, and limb-dipping (the dipping of feet or hands) have been recorded at all sites. Natural threats include a susceptibility to stochastic events (unpredictable large disturbances), large population fluctuations, and genetic inbreeding.Climate change may be responsible for the recent trend of thermal springs drying. For 14/19 past years, the Upper Hot Spring, a historically occupied thermal springs for this species, has ceased to flow. The only previously known drying event occurred in 1923, apparently due to the drought of the 1920s. For the first two known times, another historically occupied spring, the Kidney Spring, also dried in the years 2002 and 2011. Changes in precipitation patterns also most likely caused by climate change resulted in very wet years or years with unprecedented summer and fall rain events (2005, 2012, 2013) which in turn resulted in unprecedented snail population lows. As such, too much water may be just as bad as too little.","The species has been well studied over the last 19 years by Dwayne Lepitzki an independent researcher on contract with Parks Canada. From January 1996 through July 2000 total population counts occurred once every three weeks. Subsequently, the counts have been quad-weekly (once every four weeks) resulting in 13 data points per year. It is expected these counts will continue at the same frequency in 2015, meaning a total of 20 years of data will have been collected by the same person using the same methodology. The subpopulations of the species are known to fluctuate in numbers, both within a single year, as well as between years. Usually populations are at their maximum in the winter (December through February) and at their minimum during the summer (May through August) but there is variation among springs and years. Subpopulations have been observed to undergo fluctuations of two orders of magnitude within a single year. The overall total global population increased after the re-establishment of the two subpopulations to a peak at the end of 2005 of nearly 34,000 but annual population maxima seem to have steadily declined since then. Including the two re-established subpopulations, a global population minima of 3,606 was observed in early July 2012. Over the past 19 years of monitoring individual spring subpopulations, not including the two re-established ones, minima of 40 (July 2012) and 22 (August 2012) were observed with lows at the other three being 396 (August 2012), 1,179 (August 2013), and 178 (July 2012). One outflow stream subpopulation was augmented by translocating snails when the 5+ year long captive breeding program ended from December 2006 through February 2007; snails numbers in this outflow stream quickly reverted back to more typical levels.",Stable,"This species is restricted to series of small thermal springs in close proximity to the Town of Banff, within Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. It is known from seven interlinked spring sites, which are presumed to be fed by the same groundwater source (Grasby and Lepitzki 2002). Snail subpopulations were re-established into two historically occupied springs in 2002 and 2003 by translocating snails from occupied springs. Both re-established populations are self-sustaining.",There is no known trade in the species.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"A Research and Recovery Programme has been in place within BNP since 1996, resulting in many improvements and reductions in threats. This was the first Canadian wildlife species to have all legally required aspects of recovery, including a Recovery Strategy, an Action Plan, and delineated Critical Habitat, approved (Lepitzki and Pacas 2007, amended 2010). The springs sites all lie within a National Park which is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Three of the occupied springs are within areas closed to the public while 4 others are found within a National Historic Site, a high visitor use area with a recent redevelopment target of 300,000 annual visitors. Some of these springs have intruder detection systems and cameras which can alert Parks Canada enforcement wardens and result in a response and investigation.

It averaged 1338 adult beetles with high inter-annual variation. The lowest abundance was recorded in 2005 (558 adult individuals), the highest in 2002 (2944 individuals). During the last decade the overall population trend was positive, but this may have been caused by natural fluctuations. There is some evidence that rainfall is a key factor for the population fluctuations of the species (Gowan and Knisley 2014).",Stable,"The Coral Pink Sand Dunes Tiger beetle is endemic to the Coral Pink Sand Dunes in southwestern Utah, where it occurs in a small core area of the dunes, about 2 x 0.5 km¬≤ in size (Gowan and Knisley 2014).",This species like other tiger beetles is frequently collected by beetle collectors.,Terrestrial,"A conservation strategy for this species exists and there is a continuous monitoring program available.

Although the hotsprings complex has been in use by humans for over 200 years, where the species has survived structural modification and maintenance of the pools over the last 100 years, this longevity is threatened by the introduction of foreign substances such as soaps and modern shampoos as well as trampling during recreational use. These can change the water chemistry, leading to changes in habitat required by the species for successful reproduction.","The species is a habitat specialist requiring geothermally regulated water (23-30¬∞C) and occupies substrates near the water/air interface in areas of little or no water flow where the snails can position themselves and their eggs at temperatures optimal for life history requirements (COSEWIC 2008). It is short-lived (~1 year lifespan). Introduction of foreign substances by bathers such as soaps and modern shampoos may alter water chemistry, leading to changes in habitat required by the species for successful reproduction.","The very limited geographic distribution of P. wrighti renders it extremely vulnerable to disturbance. The entire reach of the population is 200 m downstream from Alpha Pool (COSEWIC 2008). The species requires geothermally regulated water (23-30¬∞C) and occupies substrates near the water/air interface. Hence it is vulnerable to changes in the stream/pool infrastructure, including factors that would reduce the water temperature or the water flow rate, such as blocking of the dam at the end of the pool or changes in groundwater supply (Lee 2006). Other factors that threaten the species are the accumulations of large amounts of soaps and oils on the surface of slow-moving areas of the stream and on vegetation, reducing the ability of P. wrighti to obtain air and impacting the longevity of the juveniles, as this is where the eggs get laid.Other threats include:Reduced groundwater flow reducing water levels in the pools exposing the snails to harmful ambient conditions (Lee and Ackerman 1998c, Lee 2000). Human trampling through recreational use, is also a threat to habitat (COSEWIC 2008).Temperature changes in portions of the stream have changed the habitat, reducing vegetation where the snails lived (Lee 2006)Future threats include hydroelectric schemes on Liard River (currently on hold), as well as gas exploration outside of the park which pose a threat to underground sources supplying groundwater to the springs. As noted in the main population viability and restoration reports, this population of P. wrighti has persisted at Liard Hotsprings for many years through modification of the spring habitat, continued human use of the upstream pools, hence it is hoped that the levels of the current threats do not escalate and that modern shampoos/soaps do not impact the populations more than their predecessors over the years.","The only known population is from Liard River Hotsprings Provincial Park, where it is present in three definable areas; Alpha Stream, lower Alpha Pool and Beta Pool (Lee 2006). The entire reach of the population is 200 metres downstream from Alpha Pool (COSEWIC 2008).Total populations estimates range from 2,359-8,196 individuals. The wide variability is probably due to differences in season when estimates made and a difference in survey distance between estimates. Population estimates are 1,426 to 5,186 snails for Alpha Stream; 23 to 2,100 for Alpha Pool; and there is one estimate of 910 for Beta Pool (Lee 2006, COSEWIC 2008).Although the structure of the habitat in Alpha Stream has changed over time (flow direction change, increased temperature, loss of submerged macrophytes), population sizes have not changed much (COSEWIC 2008). Reduced abundance in Alpha Stream in 2006 appears to be due to a loss of submerged macrophytes, which may be the result of an increase in water temperature, with seasonal trends noted in Alpha Pool, and no trend information available for Beta Pool (COSEWIC 2008). The main population is Alpha Stream and is robust and probably stable (Lee 2006).Bathers may contribute to a gradual population decline (indirect mortality) through the introduction of foreign chemicals through toiletry products (e.g., mosquito repellent, shampoo, body lotions, antibacterial soap) (Lauzier et al. 2011).",Stable,"This northern British Columbia endemic is known only from the type locality, a single stream at Liard River Hot Spring Complex in Liard River Provincial Park (Scudder 1996, Lee and Ackerman 2000, COSEWIC 2008).&#160;The species has a very restricted distribution, with an area of occupancy estimated at 4 km¬≤ (based on a 2x2 km grid cell) and occurs in a single location (based on the main threats affecting it).",There is no trade in this species.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is considered threatened by COSEWIC (2008), and as such there are proposed actions to maintain the habitats and educate hot springs users about the species.

Historically, the species was commonly caught in the Petite Rivi√®re estuary and in the the Tusket River basin (COSEWIC 2010). The Tusket River population apparently declined rapidly in the 1940s and 1950s and it is now considered extirpated, possibly due to the combined effects of construction and operation of the Tusket hydroelectric dam, poaching, and river acidification (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2016). A recent study suggests that the genetic effective population size in the Petite Rivi√®re is between 18 and 38 individuals, among the lowest of any coregonid fish species examined (Cook 2012).Approximately 12,000 captive-reared individuals of the species have been introduced into Anderson Lake, but there is no estimate of the present abundance and no confirmation of their self-sustainability (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2016).",Unknown,"The species is endemic to eastern Canada, where it is now restricted to three lakes (Hebb, Milipsigate and Minamkeak) in the upper Petite Rivi√®re watershed, near Bridgewater, Nova Scotia&#160;(COSEWIC 2010).

243,North America,Acrocephalus familiaris,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PASSERIFORMES,AVES,ACROCEPHALIDAE,Acrocephalus,familiaris,B1ac(iv),"This species qualifies as Critically Endangered because it occurs on one extremely small island and undergoes marked population fluctuations, owing to climatic events, reducing it to tiny numbers. Such fluctuations have led to extensive and strikingly low levels of genetic diversity, making it extremely vulnerable to extinction through exposure to stochastic factors including the accidental introduction of mammalian predators, non-native pest plants or insect species, as well as severe climatic events and disease. ","It is found in dense cover near the ground, particularly around the shrubs Sida fallax&#160;and&#160;Solanum nelsonii&#160;on Nihoa (VanderWerf et al. 2011, MacDonald 2012), and Scaevola taccada and Eragrostis variabilis on Laysan (Kohley and Rutt 2012, Wilcox et al. 2013, Dalton et al. 2014). On Nihoa the main foods include small beetles, spiders, roaches and larvae (Morin et al. 1997, MacDonald 2012). The original, naturally occurring Laysan population was thought to have fed primarily on moths (Henshaw 1902), however, the species is thought to be a catholic feeder, feeding on the most readily available arthropod prey items (MacDonald 2012). Forthcoming results of research will include a comparison of potential Millerbird prey on Nihoa and Laysan islands (M.A. MacDonald in prep.). Pairs show year-to-year fidelity in specific territories, with nesting apparently correlated with precipitation and most breeding taking place in the winter months (peaking January-March), although the breeding period may be extended in years of high summer rainfall (MacDonald 2012). The translocated population on Laysan breeds from at least February through September, with a peak in spring-summer months (Wilcox et al. 2013). Nests are located in dense shrubs or bunchgrass,&#160;and two eggs are generally laid (Morin et al. 1997, Wilcox et al. 2013).","The species exhibits extensive and strikingly low levels of genetic diversity as a result of recent severe bottlenecks (Addison and Diamond 2011). These may have been caused by climatic events, anthropogenic influences (impacts of Nihoa's prehistoric human population, and perhaps of modern introduction of nonnative plants and insects) or other stochastic fluctuations in habitat and consequently in population size. The Millerbird's extinction on Laysan in the early 20th century was ultimately caused by the introduction of rabbits and livestock, which denuded the island of vegetation (severe declines in the species's invertebrate prey and suitable habitat). On Nihoa, the population size is probably regulated primarily by precipitation levels, which affect the abundance of arthropod prey (extended droughts for example, are likely to have a negative impact). Severe weather events such as hurricanes may cause direct mortality of Millerbirds; a single severe storm could extinguish the entire population (USFWS 1984). Since the species has an extremely small range and has severely low levels of genetic diversity, it is particularly vulnerable to extinction through exposure to disease. Population outbreaks of the nonnative grasshoppers (e.g. the Gray Bird Grasshopper Schistocerca nitens) have periodically denuded 90% of the island's vegetated area, especially the shrubs in which Millerbirds nest. Outbreaks such as these may have been responsible for reductions in the bird population to well below 200 individuals in 1994, 1996, and 2005 (Latchininsky 2008). Fire is a past and potential threat (Morin et al. 1997) and introduction of detrimental non-native species, especially predators such as rats (Rattus spp.) is a permanent possibility. Nihoa and Laysan Finches (Telespiza ultima and T. cantans, respectively)&#160;may prey upon the eggs of Millerbirds, but since these species evolved together, it is unlikely to present a significant threat (M. A. MacDonald in litt. 2008).","The naturally occurring population on Nihoa was estimated at 489 &#160;¬± 70 (SD) in 2010, 699&#160;¬± 78 in 2011, 610&#160;¬± 210 in 2012, 468&#160;¬± 166 in 2013, and 893&#160;¬± 303 in 2014 (Gorresen et al. 2016). The most recent estimate of the nascent population on Laysan was 164 in September 2014 (Dalton et al. 2014, Freifeld et al. 2016). Considering that the Nihoa subpopulation fluctuates&#160;widely, the band 250-999 mature individuals seems appropriate. This estimate equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals.",Stable,"Acrocephalus familiaris is endemic to the steep, rocky island of Nihoa in the north-western Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A. It previously occurred on Laysan also, where the nominate race was estimated to number 1,500 birds in 1915, but became extinct between 1916 and 1923. On Nihoa, monitoring methods used from 1967 to 2014, and data recorded intermittently since the late 1960s, did not yield precise population estimates or trends for this species (Morin et al. 1997, Gorresen et al. 2012, Gorresen et al. 2016). However, the existing data do suggest that Millerbird numbers on Nihoa have experienced pronounced fluctuations and have likely ranged between fewer than 50 and more than 800 individuals (Marshall et al. 2012, Gorresen et al. 2016). The last estimates using these methods were 468 ¬± 166 (SD) individuals in September 2013 and 893 ¬± 303 (SD) in September 2014 (Gorresen et al. 2016). Wide fluctuations have had a significant impact on the genetic diversity of the remaining population, with the effective number of breeders being estimated as between 5 and 13 individuals (using samples collected in 2007 and 2009 [Addison et al. 2011]). The vegetated area of Nihoa is just 61.9 ha (86% of the island; Gorresen et al. 2012), and Millerbirds are distributed relatively evenly across the island, with some areas of slightly higher densities (MacDonald 2012, Gorresen et al. 2016). Conservation translocations were undertaken in September 2011 and August 2012, when a total of 50 Millerbirds were moved from Nihoa to Laysan, a distance of 1,037 km (Freifeld et al. 2016). The birds began breeding successfully within six months of the first release. Based on post-release monitoring through 2014, the nascent population on Laysan was estimated at 164 birds (Dalton et al. 2014, Freifeld et al. 2016).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayNihoa is part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument (H. Freifeld in litt. 2010). Legal access is controlled by a permit system that restricts access to biologists, other researchers, and native Hawaiian cultural practitioners. Strict biosecurity protocols are followed to ensure that legal visitors do not accidentally introduce new species via seeds, eggs or arthropods travelling on clothes and equipment. Visiting scientists make efforts to control alien plants by hand pulling and other methods (eg. Plentovich et al. 2014).&#160;A scoping document for translocations was produced in 2007, identifying Laysan, Kure and Lisianski as the most suitable islands on the basis of island size, elevation and a lack of predators (Morin and Conant 2007). Development of detailed translocation, release, and monitoring methods were finalized in 2011 (Farmer et al. 2011) and two successful translocations to Laysan in 2011 and 2012 resulted in a nascent population there, last estimated at 164 birds (Freifeld et al. 2016). The population will continue to be monitored and the data used to determine population persistence and growth. New, more rigorous population monitoring methods were introduced on Nihoa in recent years (Gorresen et al. 2012, Gorresen et al. 2016); these are expected to yield estimates of total numbers with improved confidence and, if monitoring is done annually, early detection of significant trends.&#160;Conservation and Research Actions ProposedContinue monitoring millerbirds on Nihoa and Laysan. Monitoring on Laysan is particularly important to document vital rates, dispersal, and habitat use, and the role of these in population persistence. Continued study of the reintroduced population on Laysan is essential to inform conservation translocations of this and other Hawaiian passerines in the future. However, monitoring and study on Laysan has become far more challenging since the closure of the long-term, year-round USFWS field camp on the island in 2013. Continue to monitor Nihoa for the highly invasive plant Cenchrous echinatus that was re-discovered in September 2011, and continue to monitor and manage invasive alien plants on Laysan (e.g., Morin and Conant 1998). Ensure strict adherence to quarantine protocols to prevent further accidental introductions of alien species. Carry out additional translocations to establish populations on other islands as appropriate (S. Conant in litt. 2008, Freifeld et al. 2016).",Oceanian,,False,False,Global,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
244,North America,Loxioides bailleui,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PASSERIFORMES,AVES,FRINGILLIDAE,Loxioides,bailleui,A4bce,"This species is listed as Critically Endangered because it has suffered extremely rapid annual population declines since 2003. The primary short-term driver of the decline is prolonged drought, which has reduced mamane pod production, but other contributing factors include habitat degradation by introduced ungulates, predation by introduced cats, and competition for caterpillar food from introduced parasitoid wasps.  ","It is confined to altitudes of c. 2,000-3,000 m, favouring dry mamane and mamane-naio forest. It feeds primarily on mamane seeds, flowers, and insects (Banko et al. 2002a, Banko and Farmer 2014, Hess et al. 2014), with the availability of mamane seeds affecting productivity and adult survival. The species is morphologically and behaviourally adapted to feeding on mamane seeds, grasping pids with its feet and using its stout bill to tear them open. A recent study found that in both mamane woodland and mixed-woodland the species spent more time foraging on pods than flowers, but in mixed-woodland took more flowers than pods (Hess et al. 2014). In drought years, most birds do not attempt to breed (Jacobi et al. 1996, Pratt et al. 1997). The species exhibits low rates of reproduction (Banko et al. 2002a, Banko and Farmer 2012),&#160;laying fewer eggs and taking longer to raise its young compared with mainland songbirds (Hess and Banko 2006). ","The most significant declines in this species's range and population are thought to have been caused by human-induced habitat loss and degradation and impacts from feral and domestic ungulates (Banko et al. 2002a, Banko and Farmer 2014, Banko et al. 2014b). The subalpine forest habitat of this species has been severely overbrowsed by sheep, mouflon sheep, goats, cattle,&#160;and its nests and adults are preyed upon primarily by feral cats, but also by introduced Black Rats Rattus rattus, Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus, and rarely Hawaiian Hawk Buteo solitarius (Banko et al. 2002a, Banko and Farmer 2014). Up to 11% of nests are depredated by feral cats each year (Hess and Banko 2006). Grazing by cattle was a historical factor in the species's decline, although cattle are now limited to pastures that are unsuitable for L. bailleui (C. Farmer in litt. 2007, Banko et al. 2014b). Alien grass cover is high in much of the species's range (Banko and Farmer 2014), suppressing mamane regeneration and potentially increasing the threat of fire (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009). Increasing human activities, such as military training, could further increase the chances of fire (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009). In 2006-2007, there were numerous fires on and near Mauna Kea, and fires in August and September 2010 affected c.560 ha of suitable habitat on the southern slope of the mountain (American Bird Conservancy 2010, Banko et al. 2014b). A fire in the species's core area could potentially affect &gt;90% of the population. The opening of trails for all-terrain vehicles in the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve is a concern (C. Farmer in litt. 2007), and may cause disturbance and habitat degradation. Continuing threats include grazing by feral sheep, wild sheep Ovis gmelini musimon, and their hybrids, which slows mamane regeneration (Pratt et al. 1997, Banko and Farmer 2012, Banko et al. 2013, Banko et al. 2014b), and alien insects preying on and parasitising native insects (Pratt et al. 1997, Banko and Farmer 2012), particularly at low elevations (Banko and Farmer 2012). Native caterpillars are an important source of protein for nestlings, and possibly breeding females; however, they are preyed upon by Yellow-jacket Wasps Vespula pensylvanica and several ant species, particularly Argentine Ants Linepithema humile, whilst parasitoid wasps kill the caterpillars by laying their eggs on or inside them (Banko and Farmer 2012). In addition to the aforementioned threats, this species's very restricted range means it could be extirpated by extreme events such as drought and storms (Banko and Farmer 2012), and drought contributed to the species's recent decline (Banko et al. 2013). Demographic patterns of mamane mortality are under investigation, as mamane may be under threat from pathogens (USFWS 2006, Banko et al. 2014b). Climate change poses a long-term future threat to the species, as drought frequency and intensity are expected to increase at higher elevations, further affecting vegetation structure and compositions, and reducing the&#160;habitat's palila carrying capacity&#160;(Benning et al. 2002, Giambelluca and Luke 2007, Banko et al. 2013). ","Survey results from 2016 suggest that the population numbered c. 1,900 individuals, with the number of mature individuals estimated at 1,660 birds (C. Farmer in litt. 2016).",Decreasing,"This species is restricted to the island of Hawaii in the&#160;Hawaiian islands&#160;(U.S.A.), where it was abundant, although locally distributed, until the beginning of the 20th century, and evidence from the fossil record suggests that the species occurred throughout the archipelago prior to human settlement (Olson and James 1982, Burney et al. 2001). In 1997, it occupied an estimated 78 km2 and numbered 4,396 birds,  mostly on the western slope of Mauna Kea, where 20.5 km2 was estimated to hold 72% of the total population (Scott et al. 1986, Fancy et al. 1997, Banko et al. 1998). Comparison of annual counts from 1980-2007 suggests that the population size has historically been subject to fluctuations (1,007-6,356 individuals) (Leonard et al. 2008), but since 2003 it has undergone a consistent and rapid decline (67% decline in the core population&#160;since 2003 and a linear projection of this decline indicates extinction by 2025)&#160;(R. Camp in litt. 2016, C. Farmer in litt. 2016). In 2016, the population was estimated at&#160;1,934 individuals (R. Camp in litt. 2016). The species's range remains centered on the western slope, and it has contracted such that c.96% of the population is found in 4,600 ha of forest (R. Camp&#160;in litt. 2014). It has not been found in annual surveys on the east slope since 2004 (P. Banko in litt. 2007, C. Farmer in litt. 2007, R. Camp in litt. 2014, 2016). A small colony of reintroduced individuals has been extirpated on the northern slope (P. Banko et al. 2014a). ",,Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayThe species's population has been monitored since 1980 (Scott et al. 1986, Leonard et al. 2008, Camp et al. 2016). In 1979, 1987 and 1998, federal courts ordered the eradication of feral goats and feral and wild sheep species from the species's habitat on Mauna Kea, and these rulings have remained in effect despite six legal challenges (Banko et al. 2009, Banko et al. 2014b). Forest regeneration has improved as a result, although current efforts to reduce sheep have not been sufficient to allow the complete recovery of mamane forests (Banko et al. 2014b).&#160; Palila have some site fidelity, but have also been detected moving around Mauna Kea into new forested areas (Banko and Farmer 2014). In 1993, some birds were translocated to a new site on the eastern slope where predators were controlled and, although many homed back to their capture site, at least two pairs stayed and bred successfully (Fancy et al. 1997). Six additional translocations have taken place since, and by the end of 2006, 188 wild birds had been translocated from the western to the northern slope of Mauna Kea (Banko and Farmer 2014). Approximately 34% persisted for longer than two months, and a small colony of up to c.23 birds remained on the northern slope and bred successfully until 2010. Although F2 generation offspring were observed, the colony was not sustainable without additional management (Banko et al. 2009, Banko and Farmer 2014) and it was extirpated by 2011 (P. Banko in litt. 2012). Egg-laying occurred in 2004, and independent juveniles were produced in every year from 2005-2010 (Banko and Farmer 2014). This translocation programme was aided by a captive breeding programme initiated at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center in 1996 (USFWS 2006, Banko and Farmer 2014). Of 28 captive-reared birds released in 2003-2009, at least 10 persisted in the reintroduction area for at least one year, with 2 males successfully producing fledglings with translocated wild females in the north slope colony before its extirpation (Banko and Farmer 2014). The construction of a highway through unoccupied, federally designated critical habitat was approved in 1999. A mitigation plan accompanied the development, including the suspension of cattle grazing in pastures adjacent to the species's range on the northern and western slopes. The species's conservation&#160;was the subject of detailed research, and funding from the mitigation plan supported translocation research and enabled the expansion or continuation of studies into the species's ecology and limiting factors, mamane ecology, food availability, predator ecology and management, and fire ecology (Banko and Farmer 2014). The state of Hawaii continues&#160;habitat restoration and research into restoration methods (Banko and Farmer 2014). Work is being carried out to restore habitat by controlling fountain grass Pennisetum setaceum, which increases the frequency and intensity of fires, and Cape ivy Delairea odorata, which reduces the vigour of native trees (American Bird Conservancy 2010). The state of Hawaii&#160;has begun programmes to control cats and rats (Pratt et al. 1997, E. VanderWerf in litt. 1999, Banko and Farmer 2014). Goats have been removed from the mountain (C. Farmer in litt. 2007), and construction is underway to build 24.5km more fence which will then enclose the majority of Palila critical habitat. Once completed there will be 100.8km of fence preventing the ingress of sheep and goats, and allowing for forest recovery to occur naturally (G. Wallace in litt. 2009, American Bird Conservancy 2010). The fence is c. 2m high and encloses c. 94 % of the species's&#160;federally designated critical habitat. In 2010, a comprehensive fire management plan was being developed for the Mauna Kea area (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009, American Bird Conservancy 2010).Conservation and Research Actions ProposedRemove and fence out ungulates from all critical habitat and the mitigation parcels (Banko et al. 2013, Banko and Farmer 2014, Banko et al. 2014b). The restoration and protection of mamane in woodlands adjacent to its current range would allow the species to exploit increased food availability in areas of their former range (Hess et al. 2014). Reforest areas adjacent to the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve and areas where alien grasses and grazing threaten mamane (Pratt et al. 1997). Carry out forest restoration research to find ways to accelerate the rehabilitation and regeneration of mamane trees within the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve. Continue to restore forest above Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (Benning et al. 2002), including expanding work on Kanakaleonui Bird Corridor. Intensify control of mammalian predators (especially feral cats) and grazing ungulates (Pratt et al. 1997, H. Baker and P. Baker in litt. 1999, T. Pratt in litt. 1999, P. Banko in litt. 2007, Banko et al. 2013, Banko et al. 2014b). Establish protocols and make preparations to control fire (Pratt et al. 1997). Continue to expand the application of translocations and captive propagation for introducing the species to currently unoccupied sites within the former range (Pratt et al. 1997, C.

245,North America,Pseudonestor xanthophrys,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PASSERIFORMES,AVES,FRINGILLIDAE,Pseudonestor,xanthophrys,B1ab(iii),"This species is listed as Critically Endangered because of its extremely small range. All of its range is fenced to protect from past degradation by introduced feral pigs, although deer now pose a new habitat threat. The species remains at risk from chance environmental events, such as hurricanes, as well as habitat degradation and the effects of exotic taxa.","It is now restricted to montane mesic and wet forest at 1,200-2,350 m (mainly 1,500-2,100 m), and is absent from adjacent areas dominated by exotic trees (Mountainspring 1987, T. Pratt in litt. 1999, D. Leonard in litt. 2012). This habitat is probably marginal, as heavy rainfall leads to drastic losses during the breeding season (Simon et al. 2000). It feeds mainly on the larvae and pupae of wood- and fruit-boring beetles, moths and other invertebrates (Mountainspring 1987, Simon et al. 1997). Range size is 9.29 ha and territories are defended year-round (Pratt et al. 2001,&#160;Warren et al. 2015). The nest is cup-shaped and placed in the outer canopy forks of mature ohia (Metrosideros polymorpha), a situation that may afford some protection from introduced predators (Simon et al. 2000). During the breeding season (between November and June), one chick is usually raised per year and young are dependent on parents for 5-8 months (Lockwood et al. 1994, T. Pratt in litt. 1999, J. C. Simon in litt. 1999, Simon et al. 2000). Studies in the Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (NAR) in east Maui in 2006-2011 found nest success probability of 19 % (n=30) and seasonal nest success of 46 %, with 49 of 106 breeding pairs monitored successfully producing one fledgling (Mounce et al. 2013). ","From 1945-1995, the invasion of feral pigs on Haleakala caused chronic habitat degradation (Loope and Medeiros 1995) and facilitated the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes into remote rainforests (Pratt 1994). All of the species's range is now fenced, and the species may respond positively as a result. However, the interaction between malaria and climate change is a potential future threat, as modelling has suggested a possible population decline of c. 75% by 2090 (Hammond et al. 2009). Furthermore, having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International unpubl. data). Weather influences the survival of young and thus potential recruitment rates (Simon et al. 1997, Becker et al. 2010). Other limiting factors include&#160;logging, cattle ranching and silviculture (VanderWerf 2012) and&#160;predation and competition from exotic bird and insect species (Mountainspring 1987, Simon et al. 1997). Rats have been observed high in native 'olapa trees and are both a potential predator of eggs and young and a potential source of competition for berries (Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project 2008). Although they have not been documented as predators of parrotbill nests, rats have been documented predating Akohekohe nests at similar heights. Mounce et al. (2013) found no significant difference in reproductive success between birds in an area with predator control (bait stations loaded with rodenticide and snap traps) and those in an area without, suggesting that current control efforts may not be sufficient. Nest predation by Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus) has been observed, though its extent and effect is unknown. Removal of small mammal nest predators may result in owl populations switching to a greater proportion of birds in their diet (Mounce 2008). Invasive plants represent a threat to habitat and require constant monitoring (D. Leonard in litt. 2012).","Extrapolating density estimates from 2001 over the species's estimated range gives a population estimate of 380-800 birds, roughly equivalent to 250-540 mature individuals (D. Leonard in litt. 2012).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.), where it is found on the north-eastern slopes of Haleakala, although fossil evidence indicates that it once occurred in the lowlands and on Moloka'i. During 1976-1983, it was estimated to number c. 500 individuals, of which 71% (c. 355) occurred above 1,500 m (Scott et al. 1986). Density surveys in 1997 and 2001 suggested similar numbers in the 35 km2 of remaining suitable habitat above 1,525 m (Simon et al. 1997, D. Leonard in litt. 2012), and the number of birds detected on point counts since 1980 has not altered significantly, but further work is needed to confirm whether the population has genuinely remained stable (H. Mounce in litt. 2008). ",,Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayLife history and demographic studies have been on-going since 2005 (D. Leonard in litt. 2012), with genetic studies on- going since 1996 (Mounce et al. 2015). The East Maui watershed is cooperatively managed with fencing at c.1,070 m and removal of feral ungulates (Loope and Medeiros 1995, P. Baker in litt. 1999). In the Waikamoi Preserve, Hanawi Natural Area Reserve and Haleakala National Park, conservation practices additionally combat the establishment of alien plants and, since the late 1980s, feral pigs have been controlled (Loope and Medeiros 1995, Simon et al. 1997). As a result, the forest understory has recovered well and non-native plant invasions have slowed (Loope and Medeiros 1995, T. Pratt in litt. 1999). A small population exists in captivity, having bred for the first time in 2000 (Maxfield 2000), and numbered 12 individuals in 2015. Progeny from this flock will be used as part of a pilot release programme in the mesic forests of leeward East Maui where weather conditions may result in higher productivity (USFWS 2003). The Leeward Haleakala Watershed Restoration Partnership has been established to help restore the south side of Maui's forests&#160;in partnership with State agencies&#160;(H. Mounce in litt. 2008) and 1,100 ha of mesic koa forest is currently being restored on leeward east Maui (Mounce et al. 2014). The state of Hawaii is working on fencing the leeward side which still contains some old growth koa - it is possible this may become a further suitable site for the establishment of a population (H. Mounce in litt. 2008). Experimental releases are planned in the next two years (Mounce et al. 2014).Conservation and Research Actions ProposedCarry out surveys to obtain an up-to-date estimate of the population size. Monitor population trends through regular surveys. Continue studies of life-history features (D. Leonard in litt. 2012). Due to their lower survival rates it has been suggested conservation measures focus on females and juveniles (Mount et al. 2014). Complete and routinely check ungulate exclusion fences (Stone and Loope 1987, Lockwood et al. 1994, Loope and Medeiros 1995, Simon et al. 1997). Conduct research to assess the impact of ungulate exclusion. Control alien plants, including outside the three wildlife protection areas (Loope and Medeiros 1995, Simon et al. 1997). Continue to replant koa forest in areas adjacent to its current distribution (Simon et al. 1997, Mount et al. 2014). Improve techniques for successful captive breeding and release. Begin public outreach concerning the importance and benefits of controlling rodents (D. Leonard in litt. 2012), and initiate rodent control at a landscape scale.

It may have been driven extinct by disease spread by introduced mosquitoes. However, it cannot yet be presumed to be Extinct until all areas of remaining habitat have been thoroughly searched. Any remaining population is likely to be tiny, and for these reasons it is treated as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct). ","In the 1890s, it was reported to eat quantities of carabid beetles, most likely wood-borers, as it was seen feeding on the dead branches of koa trees (Berger 1972). Recent sightings have been between 300 and 650 m in remnant native, lowland mesic to wet forest (Baker and Baker 2000). One nest with two eggs was collected in late January 1901 (Berger 1972). ","Some native forests remain on O`ahu, so habitat loss and alteration cannot fully explain the decline of this species (VanderWerf et al. 1997). Disease spread by introduced mosquitoes is prevalent in the lowlands (Lindsey et al. 1998) and is a likely contributory factor. Circumstantial evidence links declines of some native birds on O`ahu with the spread of introduced birds, but there is no direct evidence for their impact (Scott et al. 1986, VanderWerf et al. 1997) and, as this species probably feeds primarily on wood-boring insects, introduced birds are unlikely to be significant competitors. The construction of the H-3 freeway (for which the US Congress gave specific exemption from the Endangered Species Act) destroyed habitat around North Halawa Valley, from which some of the most recent confirmed sightings have come (Pratt 1993, J. Lepson in litt. 1999). ","Any remaining population is assumed to be tiny (numbering fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals), with the last probable sighting in 1985, despite recent searches for the species.",Unknown,"Paroreomyza maculata is endemic to O`ahu in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where fossil evidence indicates that it once occurred in the lowlands (Olson and James 1982). In the past few decades, there have only been a few confirmed sightings, with several of these from the area around North Halawa Valley, Ko`olau range (Pratt 1993). However, many recent records are viewed with doubt because of its close similarity with Hemignathus flavus. The last well-documented observation was of two birds on 12 December 1985 on Poamoho Trail during the Waipi`o Christmas Bird Count (Bremer 1986); the last specimen was taken in 1968 and some consider this the last definitive record (Roberts et al. 2010). There have been several reports from different areas since, but details of the observations have been inconclusive and the birds were never relocated. However, it cannot yet be presumed to be Extinct until further surveys have confirmed that there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.

It remains at risk from the effects of exotic taxa. A particular concern is the possible introduction of a disease-carrying mosquito species tolerant of the cooler climate at higher altitudes, thereby bringing currently safe populations of birds into contact with lethal diseases.  ","It occurs in mesic `ohi`a-koa and wet `ohi`a forest from 1,100-2,300 m (99% above 1,500 m, mostly below 2,100 m). It primarily feeds on `ohi`a nectar, also taking invertebrates, especially caterpillars. When `ohi`a bloom is at its seasonal low, it feeds on subcanopy and understorey flowers and fruit (Scott et al. 1986, Berger 1972, P. Baker in litt. 1999, J. C. Simon in litt. 1999). Average adult male home range is 0.56 ha, giving rise to density figures of 2.9 birds/ha (Pratt et al. 2001). All known nests have been in `ohi`a trees (Berlin and VanGelder 1999). It raises 1-2 young per nest, usually nesting twice seasonally (November to June [Simon et al. 2001]), and has a relatively high success rate (J. C. Simon in litt. 1999, Simon et al. 2001). Adult survivorship is similarly high (Simon et al. 2001). Birds, perhaps especially immatures, may disperse to lower elevations (Berlin and VanGelder 1999). ","Habitat destruction and modification and the rapid spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes in the lowlands are thought to be responsible for past declines. The species may be particularly vulnerable to mosquito-borne diseases because it migrates altitudinally in response to varying `ohi`a flowering physiology, potentially increasing exposure to mosquitoes at lower elevations (USFWS 2003). From 1945 to 1995, the spread of feral pigs on Haleakala caused chronic habitat degradation (Loope and Medeiros 1995) and facilitated the spread of mosquitoes into remote rainforests (Pratt 1994). In Hanawi Natural Area Reserve, there was a 473% increase in pig activity, as indexed by ground-cover disturbance, during 1970-1997 (Rosa et al. 1998), and this reduced alternative food sources to `ohi`a bloom (Berlin and VanGelder 1999). Predation by introduced rats, cats, Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and possibly small Indian Mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) is a further limiting factor (Berlin and VanGelder 1999, J. M. Scott in litt. 1999, J. C. Simon in litt. 1999, E. VanGelder in litt. 1999). Climate change is an additional threat that may cause habitat shifts and extreme weather events.","Scott et al.

Its habitat has been under severe impact from pollution and sedimentation from nearby open coalmining, and impoundment of stream sections. Diseases has impacted the species and animals are in some demand for the pet trade. Surviving populations occupy about 7% of historically suitable habitat, and remain at lower abundance than 20 years previously. Generation time is unknown but likely to be over 20 years. Much of the historical impact has ceased or been brought under tighter regulation, but while the remaining populations have mostly stabilized, population recovery to pre-impact levels has not been documented. It can be argued that the species has lost about 90% of total habitat and associated populations in its past two generations, and while causes of reduction have largely ceased, they are not clearly reversible, and population recovery to historical levels is unlikely in the future two generations if present trends and processes continue. Overall the species qualifies for Critically Endangered.","Sternotherus depressus is a nearly exclusively aquatic freshwater turtle, inhabiting medium-sized clean clear-water streams and small rivers with abundant rocky crevice cover-sites and preferably extensive snail populations.  Flattened musk turtles feed predominantly on freshwater snails and (introduced) clams, also taking some aquatic insects and their larvae (Marion et al. 1991).  Males reach sexual maturity at four to six years, females at six to eight years of age, at about 65 mm carapace length (CL). Females reach their maximum size of 12.0 cm at 30-40 years of age, males at 50-60 years (Close and Holmes in Dodd 2008). Mature females produce an average of two clutches of one to three eggs annually. Hatchlings measure 31-33 mm CL (Dodd 2008). Generation time is unknown but estimated at estimated 20-30 years.","Sternotherus depressus is primarily threatened by habitat degradation and loss, and secondarily by collection and possibly disease. Siltation, from coal strip mining and improper runoff and stream bank management associated with forestry, agriculture and construction, eliminates the essential rock crevice hiding areas, reduces or eliminates molluscan prey, and may contain toxic compounds.  While the species is legally protected from collection, illegal collection for pets remains a concern (Dodd 2008).  A severe disease outbreak swept through the Sipsey Fork population in 1985-1986, more than halving its population in one year; disease was also recorded at other streams but its impact was not quantified. The diseases has been speculated to involve a compromised immune system. By 1995 the Sipsey Fork population had not yet recovered to pre-disease levels (Bailey and Guyer 1998), and Fonnesbeck and Dodd (2003) documented that a short-term modest reduction in survivorship created serious long-term consequences for the population.  Leech infestation rates are inversely correlated to environmental pollution levels (Dodd 1988).","Dodd (1990) estimated that 56.3% of historically suitable habitat was degraded to the point that it had lost its S. depressus populations, 36.9% was severely degraded and contained remnant populations, and only 6.9% of original habitat remained reasonably unaffected by pollution, sedimentation and impoundments. Throughout the 1990s, populations continued to decline (Bailey and Guyer 1998), and the most recent surveys (before 2006) indicate that some viable populations remain, these were considered stable but at lower abundance than they had been in the mid-1980s (Dodd 2008).

Detailed quantitative range-wide estimates are not available, but overall reduction is likely to have exceeded 80% of habitat and 90% of individuals over the course of the 20th century, with declines stabilized in many but not all sites at present, and only localized population increases. Due to the species‚Äô highly fragmented occurrence in habitats subject to vegetational succession, intensive management is needed to retain existing populations; creation of alternative sites is challenging; and the species‚Äô low reproductive output (on average under four eggs/year per mature female) and relatively late maturity (about six years) means recovery is a slow gradual process at best.  Based on available data, the Bog Turtle is on the boundary between Endangered and Critically Endangered, since the generation time and thus assessment period are uncertain; at a generation time of 15 years (likely a severe underestimate), an 80% decline in total number of individuals over the past three generations (A2), as well as the past two plus the next generation (A4), appears realistic, qualifying the species as Critically Endangered by criteria A2cd and A4ce.","Glyptemys muhlenbergii is a near-exclusive inhabitant of marsh and swamp habitat away from large water bodies; typical habitats include stream-head sedge meadows, spring-fed sphagnum bogs, fens, and open shrubby swamps, and nearby small streams. In contrast to its vernacular name, the Bog Turtle generally avoids strongly acidic bogs (pH &lt;5.5). As Ernst and Lovich (2009) noted, these are often ecologically ephemeral habitats due to vegetation succession. Bog Turtles have small home ranges, at the order of fractions of a hectare, but moderate-distance movements have been reported travelling both overland and using small streams (Carter et al. 2000, Pittmann et al. 2009). Bog Turtles are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on a great variety of invertebrate and small vertebrate animal prey as well as seeds, fruits and occasionally other parts of a range of herbs, grasses, sedges and shrubs (see review by Ernst and Lovich 2009).  Bog Turtles can reach up to 11.5 cm carapace length (CL) in males, and 9.6 cm CL in females. Size and age at maturity has been reported as about 7‚Äì8 cm CL and 4‚Äì6 years in males, and half a cm larger and likely a year later in females. Females normally produce a single clutch of 3‚Äì4 (range 1‚Äì6) eggs; not all females reproduce in any given year. Hatchlings measure on average 26‚Äì28 mm CL. Longevity may exceed 30 years; generation time has not been calculated (see review by Ernst and Lovich 2009). ","Much Bog Turtle habitat has been destroyed by drainage and conversion in recent centuries as its wetland habitat is generally located in optimal agricultural soils and landscapes, processes that continue to some extent into the present. Being often located at the lower edges of intensively farmed lands, sedimentation and agrochemical run-off into wetland habitat is an issue.  The Bog Turtle's range is localized, both at the geographic scale (scattered areas of occurrence with extensive areas where the species is absent from suitable habitat) and at the local landscape scale, where suitable habitat is localized in a mosaic of other habitat types. Fragmentation of habitat has continued with agricultural intensification and optimization, and infrastructure, residential and industrial development.  Within protected wetland habitat areas, vegetation succession by both native plants and invasives can reduce the suitability of wetlands to bog turtles.  While fully protected throughout its range, the Bog Turtle remains in small but high demand in the pet trade by virtue of its small size, attractive colouration and reputed rarity. Because of the small home range size and sensitivity of its wetland habitat, disturbance and habitat trampling are greater concerns for this species than most other turtles. Road mortality and increased predation of eggs and hatchlings from subsidized raccoons has been indicated. The impact of global warming, under various predicted scenarios, on hydrology and habitat supporting the Bog Turtle has not yet been evaluated in detail but warrants concern. Reports of die-offs, presumed related to disease, emerged in 2009; the extent and severity of epidemic disease has not been documented range-wide, but Brenner et al. (2002) and Carter et al. (2005) reported incidence of bacterial and mycoplasma potential pathogens in NC and VA populations. ","Population densities for Bog Turtle occurrences have been reported ranging from one to 213 turtles per hectare. Given the small size of most sites inhabited by bog turtles (average of about one hectare in the south, variable size in the northern population), individual sites rarely comprise more than 40 adult individuals (Chase 1989, Mitchell 1991). Exchange of individuals between local sites has not been reported. Juveniles represent substantial proportions of the population in some sites (MD: Chase et al. 1989; NY: Warner 2005), but are rarely encountered at other sites (NJ: Arndt, 1986).Northern populations (Massachusetts to Maryland) were determined to have declined in range and numbers by over 50% during the period 1977‚Äì1997, with 360 sites of occurrence remaining, of which 95% are on privately-held lands (FWS 2001). Extensive surveys of southern population in the 1980s identified 96 sites of occurrence, of which only 52 were considered viable; about 85% of occurrences were on private lands (Tryon and Herman 1991).   Beth Walton (Ph.D thesis, 2006) analysed habitat trends in Ashe County, North Carolina, and concluded that 2‚Äì3% of suitable habitat remains.

The species is protected by legislation or regulation in each of the States where it occurs. It is included in CITES Appendix I, precluding all international commercial trade. A recovery plan was compiled for the northern population in 2001. A number of sites inhabited by Bog Turtles are under government or NGO ownership and management, while owners of lands where bog turtles occur are engaged where possible to manage bog turtle sites optimally. Due to the high risk of illegal collection, localities are generally held in secrecy.  Key conservation measures required focus on safeguarding remaining habitat from destruction, degradation, pollution and conversion, managing habitat with regard to vegetation succession and invasives (through grazing, winter burning, or other measures), and landscape planning and management measures to prevent and reverse fragmentation of populations. Further population monitoring and surveys, research on conservation biology, climatic change impacts and disease issues, law enforcement action to address any illegal take and trade, and stakeholder outreach, all need to accompany these habitat measures.  Genetic study is needed to evaluate phylogeography with regard to the two main distribution areas, and to inform intensive management options including head-starting and translocation.&#160;  Extensive literature exists detailing population data, threats and recommended conservation measures; useful entry points into the literature are USFWS (2001), NatureServe (2005) and Ernst and Lovich (2009).",Nearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

However, it cannot yet be presumed to be Extinct until all remnant patches of possible breeding habitat have been searched, and unconfirmed reports have been followed up. Any remaining population is likely to be tiny, and for these reasons it is treated as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct). ","It bred in seasonally flooded swamp-forest, always near standing water (Curson et al. 1994), apparently showing a strong association with canebrakes of the bamboo Arundinaria gigantea, and blackberry (Pulliam 2010). Like the closely-related V. cyanoptera and V. chrysoptera it may have been a bird of gaps, edges, and early-mid successional habitats within the forest mosaic (although bachmanii had more of a preference for forest canopy), and it apparently did not require primeval swamp forest: the last documented breeding site had previously been a rice field some decades before (Pulliam 2010). Winter habitat requirements were much less specific, with records from dry forest, wetlands and urban areas (Hamel 1995), but apparently favouring wooded areas with flowering Hibiscus trees (Curson et al. 1994). Breeding occurred from March-June, with the nest constructed in the shelter of a dense bush or tangle of vegetation (Curson et al. 1994). Migrants were seen in Peninsular and insular Florida in early spring and late summer (March-April and July-August; Pulliam 2010).  ","The drainage of river-bottom swamplands (Curson et al. 1994), and the near-total clearance of canebrakes in the USA, combined with the conversion of much of Cuba to sugarcane plantation, offer the best explanation for the disappearance of this species.

It may also survive in south-eastern Cuba, but there have been no confirmed records since 1987 despite many searches. If extant, the global population is likely to be tiny, and for these reasons it is treated as Critically Endangered.  ","It was originally found in both bottomland hardwood and montane (pine, mixed and broadleaf) forests in the U.S.A. and Cuba. Historic accounts indicate that it has a very large home range and occurs naturally at low densities, suggesting that large contiguous tracts of mature woodland would be required to support a viable population (Jackson 2002). The Big Woods area comprises several distinct types of swamp and bottomland hardwood forests (Fitzpatrick et al. 2005), covering a total area of c.220,000 ha. In Cuba, extensive habitat loss and degradation in the lowlands mean that any remaining population may be restricted to intact montane Pinus cubensis forests. The primary requirement is for dead trees, which harbour wood-boring beetle larvae, its preferred food source. It forages by stripping bark from dead trees, using its bill like a carpenter's chisel, and also takes fruit, nuts and seeds (Jackson 2002). The breeding season is between March and June in Cuba, and between February and May in the U.S.A. ","Logging and clearance for agriculture are responsible for the dramatic decline in numbers and range. These factors are likely to threaten any remaining population. Hunting has also been implicated in the rapid population decline, and it has been proposed that this was the primary cause of its decline, with habitat destruction playing a secondary role, but this theory is contentious (Snyder 2007, Hill 2008, M. Lammertink in litt. 2012). ","Given the lack of confirmed sightings since 1944 any remaining population within the USA is likely to be tiny. A tiny population may also remain in Cuba, despite lack of recent sightings. Its total population, if extant, is likely to number fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Campephilus principalis formerly occurred at low densities throughout the south-east U.S.A. (nominate principalis) and Cuba (subspecies bairdii). Sixty years after the last confirmed North American record in north-eastern Louisiana in 1944,&#160;the species was reported to have been rediscovered in 2004 in the Big Woods region of eastern Arkansas (Fitzpatrick et al. 2005).&#160;Evidence for the rediscovery comes in the form of seven sightings, a short poor-quality video, over 100 sound recordings indicative of this species from automatic recording stations, and a number of additional ""possible encounters"" (Charif et al. 2005, Dalton 2005, Fitzpatrick et al. 2005, M. Lammertink in litt. 2005, 2006). The sound and video recordings have been analysed in detail, and the identity of the recorded birds has been debated between Ivory-billed Woodpecker and Pileated Woodpecker Dryocopus pileatus (Fitzpatrick et al. 2005, Sibley et al. 2006, Fitzpatrick et al. 2006, Sibley et al. 2007, Collinson 2007, Fitzpatrick et al. 2007). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that the recordings provided compelling evidence for the presence of Ivory-billed Woodpecker in 2004, and that search efforts were warranted (USFWS 2010). However, intensive searches until 2009 did not find evidence for the continued presence of the species in the Big Woods region. There were also unconfirmed reports by researchers working in forests along the Choctawhatchee River in Florida, reporting 14 sightings and 41 acoustic encounters heard during 2005-2006, and further sightings and calls in the 2006-2007 field season, but again incontrovertible evidence is still required (Hill et al. 2006).&#160;Similarly, recordings made during 2006 and 2008 in Louisiana suggest characteristics of the species but could represent Pileated Woodpecker (Collins 2011, 2017). A search in the coastal mangrove forests and inland hammock forests of south Florida in 2009 failed to find any sign of the species (Gold 2009), but south Florida has large areas of potential habitat and there is a relatively high frequency of plausible reports from there in recent decades (M. Lammertink in litt. 2012). Between the last confirmed sightings in 1944 and the 2000s records discussed above, there were more than 20 reports from within its historic range (Jackson 2002, Roberts et al. 2010) and Michaels (2015) suggests there have been many more unconfirmed sightings, including records from several years after the last official sighting in 1944. Until hard evidence is obtained though, this subspecies should be considered possibly extinct. The species may survive in Cuba, although searches have not found any new records subsequent to those of the late 1980s (M. Lammertink in litt. 2004). The best hope lies in the Alejandro de Humboldt National Park, an area in which despite regular bird inventories being taken some sections have been only sparsely searched (M. Lammertink in litt. 2012). Calls potentially of this species were heard in 1998 in the Sierra Maestra in south-east Cuba (D. S. Lee verbally 1998, G. M. Kirwan in litt. 1999), in an area from which there had been no historical records and at an elevation higher than the known altitudinal range of the species. Follow-up searches in the area found poor habitat and no indications of presence of the species (M. Lammertink in litt. 2004). With the lack of recent confirmed records and no evidence of large woodpecker activity (M. Lammertink in litt. 2012), this subspecies also may well be extinct. A recent statistical analysis of physical evidence and independent expert opinion, as part of a study into the burden of proof required for controversial sightings of possibly extinct species, supported the view that this species is very likely extinct (Roberts et al. 2010). Similarly, use of statistical methods for estimating the probability of species persistence from collection dates of museum specimens, along with quantitative stopping rules for terminating the search for missing or allegedly extinct species (based on survey data for counts of co-occurring species that are encountered in the search for a target species) suggest there is virtually no chance that the species remains extant within its historical range in the southeastern United States (Gotelli et al. 2012). In addition, a Bayesian method accounting for sightings of uncertain validity was applied to certain and uncertain sightings over the period 1897-2010, and results indicated substantial support for extinction (Solow et al. 2012). Nevertheless, other statistical studies have shown that, when considering the specific natural history traits of large woodpeckers, small numbers of Ivory-billed Woodpecker may have persisted up to the present (Mattsson et al. 2008), and that very large search efforts are needed to detect small populations (Scott et al. 2008). Any remnant population in either the U.S.A. or Cuba is likely to be tiny. ",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayAfter the reported rediscovery in February 2004, intensive surveys involving dozens of observers, automatic cameras and recording equipment have been carried out in the Big Woods area (Fitzpatrick et al. 2005). Searches have also continued in other parts of the south-east U.S.A. that have historic records of the species, with specific searches taking place in 28 locations across that area in 2004-2009 (Hill et al. 2006, Rohrbaugh et al. 2007, M. Lammertink in litt. 2012). An endangered species recovery team of c. 50 members has been appointed (Jackson 2006). Between October 2003 and September 2013 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) spent $20.3 million on efforts to document and protect the species, including through habitat protection and acquisition ($13.2 million spent on land acquisitions) (Jackson 2015). In October 2009, the search for the species in the U.S.A. was suspended because the most promising areas, including most of Arkansas's Big Woods, had already been surveyed to some extent (Dalton 2010, M. Lammertink in litt. 2012). USFWS published a recovery plan in April 2010 (Dalton 2010, USFWS 2010). Part of the Big Woods area falls within the Cache River and White River national wildlife refuges. In Cuba there have been a number of searches for the species, and further searches were planned for 2010 and 2011 (BirdLife International unpubl. data).Conservation Actions ProposedEvaluate new reports of the species and follow up with searches in cases of credible reports in the U.S.A. and Cuba (M. Lammertink in litt. 2012), to document the species's continued existence and determine its population size and distribution. Ensure strict protection of any nests and nesting trees, if found. Ensure the implementation of appropriate protective measures if a population is found in Cuba.

On Kaua`i, it survived in the Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve into the mid-1970s, with c.62 birds being present during 1968-1973 (USFWS 1983), but only a few in 1981 (Scott et al. 1986), two in 1989 and none since. On Hawai`i, several populations were present in the early 1980s, with c.394 estimated during 1976-1983 (Scott et al. 1986) but, in 1984, a lava-flow from Mauna Loa passed through the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve, the species's stronghold (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998), and the last confirmed sighting was in 1987 (Snetsinger et al. 1998).

257,North America,Myadestes palmeri,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PASSERIFORMES,AVES,TURDIDAE,Myadestes,palmeri,B1ab(iii),"This species qualifies as Critically Endangered because it has an extremely small range, wholly confined to one upland area where habitat quality is continuing to decline. It has apparently always been rare, although the reasons for this are unclear and the range and population trends are difficult to judge, because it is extremely elusive, and occurs in some areas that are difficult to access. Reintroduction of captive-bred individuals failed to lead to a significant population increase (Switzer et al. 2013); until declines in habitat quality are halted and predation by introduced mammals is addressed, the species will not recover. However, the population, whilst small, appears to be stable (Crampton et al.&#160;2017).&#160; ","It is now restricted to high-elevation `ohi`a forests. It is a ravine specialist, favouring stream banks with a rich understorey (Kepler and Kepler 1983, Scott et al. 1986, Conant et al. 1998). Many recorded nests have been placed in cliffs above streams. It is primarily frugivorous, with arthropods (particularly insects) forming an important dietary component (Kepler and Kepler 1983,  Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1999). At least one bird died after malaria infection in the wild, but some birds may be disease resistant (Herrmann and Snetsinger 1997, Snetsinger et al. 1999). Prevalence of malaria is increasing in this species, and survival of chronically infected birds was similar to that of uninfected birds (Atkinson et al. 2014, VanderWerf et al. 2014). Breeding is typically between March and August. It has potentially high but variable productivity, with pairs producing 0.4 to 4.9 young per year in three years of observation (Snetsinger et al. 1999); annual variation in number of offspring produced is correlated with breeding season precipitation (Fantle-Lepcyk et al. 2016).&#160;It is now the sole native frugivore on Kauai, and probably plays a major role in seed dispersal within its range. ","Avian pox-like lesions have been observed on a mist-netted bird (Herrmann and Snetsinger 1997), and avian malaria is suspected to cause some mortality; at least three captive birds that died soon after release were determined to be infected with malaria (Snetsinger et al. 1999, K. Wakelee in litt. 1999).&#160;Currently, there are no forested areas on Kaua‚Äòi where the mean ambient temperature prevents the seasonal incursion of malaria; mosquitoes and malaria can survive across all parts of the island, at least periodically. An increase in temperature of 2¬∞ C would result in an 85 % decrease in the land area on Kaua‚Äòi where malaria transmission currently is only periodic (Benning et al. 2002). Between 2007-2013, 66 wild Puaiohi were tested for malaria and 11 (22.7%) were determined to be infected, whereas 0 of 7 were infected between 1994-1997 (Atkinson et al. 2014). Thus, disease may limit Puaiohi from inhabiting low elevation areas with suitable nesting habitat. However, long-term survival of chronically infected individuals is similar to that of uninfected individuals (VanderWerf et al. 2014), so other factors, such as degradation of the native forest by non-native plants may also be limiting their range (Crampton et al. 2017).Several plants, including blackberry (Rubus argutus), Australian Tree Fern (Cyathea cooperi), Kahili Ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) Daisy Fleabane (Erigeron annuus) and Strawberry Guava (Psidium cattleianum) have significantly altered areas currently and recently occupied by Puaiohi, and have the potential to convert the forest canopy, understorey and cliffs used for nesting substrate to unsuitable habitat (P. Roberts in litt. 2007). The destruction of the understory by feral pigs has been implicated in this species's rarity (Kepler and Kepler 1983).Predation by native Short-eared Owls (Asio flammeus) and alien mammals (e.g. rats) suppresses productivity and competition for food with introduced insects, birds and mammals may also have negative impacts (Snetsinger et al. 1999, Snetsinger et al. 2005). Low female and juvenile survival likely limits its rate of increase; at least some female and nestling mortality is caused by predation of rats at nests (VanderWerf et al. 2014; L. Crampton&#160;pers. obs.), and rats also likely take recently fledged birds. Although hurricanes have caused serious damage to its habitat, the species appeared to recover relatively well, probably because ravines are better sheltered (Conant et al. 1998, Snetsinger et al. 1999).","The population was estimated at 494 breeding individuals (95% CI 414-580 birds) in 2013 (Crampton et al. 2017). Previous estimates, derived from Conrow (1999), Lieberman and Kuehler (1998), Snetsinger et al. (1999), T. Snetsinger in litt. (2000), and P. Roberts in litt. (2007) totalled 200-525 individuals, roughly equivalent to 130-330 mature individuals. However, because these estimates did not encompass the entire range, the population is assumed to have been stable in size since the mid-1990s (Crampton et al. 2017).",Stable,"Myadestes palmeri is endemic to Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where recent records are all from the Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve. It was lost from the Waiau and possibly the Halekua drainages (T. Snetsinger per P. Donaldson in litt. 1999), but after Hurricane Iniki appeared to slightly expand its population range in the Mohihi and other drainages (Snetsinger et al. 1999). It formerly occurred in lowland habitats, but probably only locally, and was extirpated from these areas by the end of the 19th century (J. Lepson in litt. 1999, Snetsinger et al. 1999, Burney et al. 2001).&#160;Few birds were detected after two hurricanes in the 1990s, but the population size is thought to have recovered to pre-hurricane numbers (Pratt 1994,&#160;Conant&#160;et al.&#160;1998,&#160;Snetsinger&#160;et al.&#160;1999). A captive breeding programme that began in 1996 led to the release of 237 captive bred birds, although a few captive-bred birds successfully bred in the wild, survival and recruitment of captive bred birds was generally poor and the programme has been discontinued (Switzer&#160;et al.&#160;2013; VanderWerf&#160;et al.&#160;2014; The Garden Island 2016). Currently, the population size is estimated at 494 breeding individuals (Crampton et al. 2017).&#160;",,Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayIt is protected in the Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve and portions of the fenced Hono O Na Pali Natural Area Reserve (KHON2, 2014). Rat poison bait stations were placed near a few nests with moderate success (Snetsinger et al. 1999), and currently approximately 200 Goodnature A24 traps control rodents in the Halehaha area, which is currently being fenced with an ungulate proof fence to be completed in 2016 (Else 2016; Crampton 2016). Several types of rodent-resistant nest boxes have been installed in nesting habitat in Mohihi and Kawaikoi, and one pair was documented to nest successfully in one box. A captive population was established in 1996, and 14 birds were released into the wild in 1999 (Lieberman and Kuehler 1998, Conrow 1999,&#160;USGS News Release 1999, T. Snetsinger in litt. 2000). Releases continued subsequently until 2012, with a total of 222 birds released (Switzer et al. 2013). The captive-bred birds bred with each other and with wild birds (Switzer et al.&#160;2013). Birds released in 1999-2001 survived and reproduced better than birds released from 2002-2006, with roughly only half of the birds released from 2002-2007 surviving for one month or longer. From 2005-2011, long-term survival of 123 captive-bred birds was very low and it was concluded that the release of captive-bred birds has had little effect on the wild population in recent years (VanderWerf et al. 2014). Furthermore, the captive flock was suffering from inbreeding depression (B. Masuda pers. comm). Thus the captive breeding programme has been discontinued and all healthy captive-bred Puaiohi were released into the wild in 2016 (The Garden Island, 2016). Research on the factors limiting the species and the potential of management actions is ongoing.&#160;A species-specific survey method to survey the entire population was developed in 2011, and used and to predict areas of suitable habitat from 2011-2013 (Crampton et al.&#160;2017). This effort confirmed that likely high density areas of Puaiohi have already been identified, but indicated other areas likely to host low-moderate densities of Puaiohi that have not yet been surveyed.&#160;Conservation and Research Actions ProposedContinue to survey areas of suitable habitat that have not yet been surveyed. Funding to use song meters and field teams to survey these areas will be conducted in 2017 (L. Crampton pers. comms.). Studies of disease prevalence and factors promoting transmission of avian pox and malaria, and disease management options are ongoing (Puaiohi Working Group and Hawaiian Forest Bird Recovery Team 2010, Crampton 2016). Research suggests that reducing nest predation by controlling rats may be the best available management option (VanderWerf et al. 2014); an experimental rat trapping programme with self-resetting GoodNature A24 traps was initiated in 2015, expanded in 2016 and will continue through 2017 (Crampton 2016). This study combines assessment of the efficacy of the traps in reducing rodents and impacts on nest success. Continue to conduct research to determine the impacts of predation and habitat degradation by alien species. Ungulate-proof fencing (completed, ongoing and proposed) will facilitate this research.

259,North America,Anas laysanensis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,ANSERIFORMES,AVES,ANATIDAE,Anas,laysanensis,B1ac(iv),"This species is listed as Critically Endangered because its population exhibits extreme fluctuations within its extremely small range. Conservation action is seeking to remove existing threats or increase the species's resilience to them, and the population was increasing following the successful reintroduction of birds to Midway Atoll, however outbreaks of avian botulism and a tsunami in 2011 appear to have caused major setbacks to the recovery. The species is consequently precautionarily maintained as Critically Endangered, since although it now occurs at two locations and was recently translocated to a third island, population fluctuations have continued within the past five years. ","The species is non-migratory and characterised by female-only parental care and high adult survival. On Laysan, long-term pair bonds are common, and 3-4 eggs are laid per clutch. The timing of breeding varies significantly between years, with the beginning of incubation varying from December to July (Reynolds et al. 2007). It selects different habitats during different times of the day. Most adult birds use dense cover and hide in the terrestrial vegetation during the day. During the evening and at night (Reynolds 2004), the species uses the central hyper-saline lake on Laysan, but concentrates near freshwater seeps around the shore (M. Morin in litt. 1999), especially when raising young ducklings which are less tolerant of hyper-saline conditions. It nests and rests in dense stands of shrubs and grasses (Moulton and Marshall 1996). It feeds principally on invertebrates, but also grass and sedge seeds, and some algae (Reynolds  et al. 2006a); brine fly Scatella sexnotata is an important prey species whose peak spring abundance is positively correlated with annual brood production of the teal (Reynolds et al. 2007). Reintroduced birds on Midway Atoll appear to breed successfully at an earlier age and produce larger clutches than birds on Laysan, probably owing to more food and a low population density. On Midway, individuals in their first year and produce an average clutch of seven eggs, whereas birds on Laysan nest in their second year, producing an average of 3.3 eggs (Walters and Reynolds 2013). Duckling survival is low on both sites. ","Random disasters and the limited carrying capacity of the fragile tiny islands are the main threats to the species's persistence. Historic declines on Laysan leading to the near-extinction of the species are attributed to introduced rabbits and, more recently, the parasitic nematode Echinuria uncinata, coupled with drought (Work et al. 2004). Since the severe range contraction of the species from the main Hawaiian Islands after the introduction of rats, stochastic events that have already occurred include: the accidental introduction of noxious competitors, extreme weather, and disease epizootics. Additional populations on different islands are needed to reduce the extinction risk to small concentrated populations from alien predator introductions, tsunamis, and hurricanes, as the probability that disasters will affect several islands simultaneously is lower.&#160; In March 2011, an earthquake off the east coast of Japan triggered a tsunami that arrived at the north-western Hawaiian Islands at night and partially inundated Midway Atoll and Laysan Island (M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). It is reported to have over-washed 60-78% of Eastern Island and 15-20% of Sand Island, and affected c.15% of the species's breeding habitat on Laysan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011, M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). A botulism outbreak followed due to the more than 110,000 dead albatross chicks left by the flooding (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011, M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). Freshwater wetlands were also contaminated with sea water and carcasses (M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). Most of the vegetation on Eastern Island was lost. Prior to the tsunami, two winter storms struck in January and February, bringing high wind and extensive flooding. Following the winter storms and tsunami, the population experienced complete reproductive failure (M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). On Laysan Island, brood rearing habitat is probably an important limiting factor. Freshwater seeps with high invertebrate abundance and adjacent dense vegetative cover are used as duckling nurseries. High incidence of duckling trauma suggests these freshwater seeps may become overcrowded. Reproductive success is sometimes related to brine fly (prey abundance) densities which, in turn, are reduced by drought and low water-levels (Moulton and Marshall 1996, M. Reynolds unpublished data). During drought conditions, the birds depend more on terrestrial prey (Reynolds 2004). Introduced ants (e.g. big-headed ant Pheidole megacephala) are probably competitors for their terrestrial invertebrate prey (Reynolds  et al. 2006b). Disease or parasitic infestation by the nematode Echinuria uncinata (M. Reynolds in litt. 2000) are perhaps one of the greatest potential threats - the catastrophic outbreak of avian botulism killed 40-50% of teal on Midway in 2008 (M. Reynolds in litt. 2008, Work et al. 2010), and an outbreak of this disease has occurred every year since (M. Reynolds in litt. 2011, 2012, J. Walters in litt. 2011). Some alien invasive plants on Laysan have threatened nesting and wetland habitat (Morin et al. 1997, M. Morin in litt. 1999), including the central hyper-saline lake where the species forages (VanderWerf 2012).&#160;The wetlands on Midway are threatened by future flooding events and require periodic maintenance, including management of wetland plants and algae and the removal of alien mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) (VanderWerf 2012).Having a distribution on relatively low-lying islands, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change through sea-level rise and shifts in suitable climatic conditions (BirdLife International unpublished data). Other threats faced by the species include accelerated filling of the interior lake and freshwater seeps due to alien wetland plant species, and erosion of dunes from storm impacts (M. Reynolds in litt. 2011). ","The total population on Laysan Island was estimated at 521 birds (95% CI: 492-549) in 2010, with probably over 400 individuals (between 268 and 473) on Midway in 2010 (M. Reynolds in litt. 2011). Twenty-eight individuals were translocated to Kure Atoll in 2014. This suggests that the population numbers c.500-680 mature individuals in total.",Increasing,"The species is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.), where it became confined to Laysan Island. The birds do not disperse from Laysan today, but sub-fossil remains indicate that it was widespread on the Hawaiian Islands in the past (Reynolds and Kozar 2000), most recently being extirpated from Lisianski Island about 150 years ago. The species was near extinction at the beginning of the 20th century, but the population increased to 500 individuals in 1987 (Marshall 1992), following the removal of introduced rabbits from Laysan. In 1993, there was a complete breeding failure and severe die-off owing to drought and disease. Poor monitoring at this time impairs accurate population estimates, but post-hoc analysis suggests that the population dropped to 82-127 adults from a peak of 743 birds prior to the drought. Since then, the population gradually increased, reaching an estimated 521 birds in 2010 (M. Reynolds in litt. 2011). Apparent population fluctuations over the past century were previously attributed to differing methods and seasons of counts (Marshall 1992), but are now thought to relate to genuine changes (M. Reynolds and G. Ritchotte in litt. 2002). With the Laysan population possibly approaching carrying capacity, 42 individuals were translocated to the two islands of Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in 2004 and 2005; the birds bred successfully in their first year (Reynolds and Klaviter 2006). The founder population increased in size to a total of 104 individuals in 2006 (Jarrett 2006), reaching c.200 adult and juvenile (post-fledging) individuals by the end of 2007 (USGS unpublished data, Reynolds et al. 2008) and predicted to grow to a total of 380 birds (Reynolds et al. 2008). Although being hit by an outbreak of avian botulism in 2008 which killed over 160 birds (a decline of up to 40-50%) (M. Reynolds in litt. 2008), the preliminary estimates from Midway placed the population in 2010 at c. 350 (M. Reynolds in litt. 2010). The Laysan population is believed to have been reduced by 50% following a tsunami in March 2011 (J. R. Walters in litt. 2013). On Midway, approximately 20-30% of the banded adult birds observed before this tsunami were not observed afterwards (M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). In 2014, 28 individuals were translocated from Midway Atoll to Kure Atoll, a mammalian predator-free island which lies approximately 1,350 miles north-west of Honolulu (Ward and Fredrickson 2014). As of early May 2015, 19 ducklings had hatched on the island (Anon. 2015).&#160; ",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I. Laysan is part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The alien grass Cenchrus echinatus is thought to have been eradicated (M. Morin in litt. 1999) and native bunch grass has responded positively (Reynolds  et al. 2006b). Snow fences were installed 20 years ago to reduce the movement of sand and support natural revegetation (Moulton and Marshall 1996). A comprehensive restoration plan for Laysan Island has been developed, some sections of which are underway (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). In 2004-2005, 42 wild birds translocated from Laysan Island were released on Midway Atoll and many bred successfully in their first season.&#160;Management on Midway Atoll includes monitoring the ecology and demography of the species as well as the enhancement and creation of freshwater wetland habitats (VanderWerf 2012).&#160;Following the success of the releases on Midway, the next translocations were discussed for Kure or Lisianski Islands in the north-west Hawaiian Islands (USGS unpublished data, M. Reynolds in litt. 2008) and&#160;in 2014, Kure Atoll received 28 individuals from Midway Atoll (Ward and Fredrickson 2014).&#160;During the 2008 avian botulism outbreak on Midway, 28 sick birds were successfully treated with anti-toxin, rehabilitated and released, and the rapid removal of sick and dead birds was thought to have prevented the impact of the outbreak becoming even worse (M. Reynolds in litt. 2008). Management strategies have been initiated on Midway Atoll that should reduce the future impact of avian botulism outbreaks, including: annual flooding of the concrete-lined catchment during the summer months; drainage and cleaning of the catchment in the autumn or winter months to remove accumulated debris and seabird remains; vegetation removal around wetlands to allow carcass detection; weekly population monitoring that includes carcass removal and searches for sick birds; wetland carcass searches daily during the summer months; and use of heavy equipment and portable pumps each year to improve water quality (Work et al. 2010).&#160;Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor the population size and health on Midway Atoll, Laysan Island and Kure Atoll. Continue to enhance nesting habitat on Midway by planting native bunch grasses.&#160;Remove mice (Mus musculus) from Sand Island, Midway, to allow recruitment of native bunch grass (VanderWerf 2012).&#160;Enhance brood-rearing habitat on Midway Atoll with small fish-free freshwater wetlands with abundant cover. Use translocation and ecosystem restoration to re-establish three additional populations of Laysan Ducks. On Laysan, continue to stabilise dunes by planting native vegetation (Moulton and Marshall 1996) and remove alien plant species (VanderWerf 2012). Restore freshwater wetlands on Lisianski prior to potential re-introduction. Ensure strict procedures to prevent the accidental introduction of exotic plants, invertebrates and animals (Moulton and Marshall 1996).&#160;Control exotic plants likely to negatively impact the species. Conduct further alien predator eradications to create potential for reintroduction to other larger, higher elevated islands. After restored predator-free habitat is available, create a new genetically managed captive population within Hawaii to provide birds for reintroductions to other Hawaiian islands (Reynolds  et al. 2006b).&#160;Assess genetic variability of translocated populations for several generations post-translocation, and introduce new individuals where necessary to maintain genetic variation in the population (Lavretsky&#160;et al. 2014).&#160;Investigate the feasibility of vaccinating at least some birds in the Midway Atoll population against avian botulism (Work et al. 2010).

","It is found in high-elevation `ohi`a and koa-`ohi`a forest, but the latter is mainly distributed in the Koke`e region, from where it is retreating (USFWS 1983, Scott et al. 1986, Pratt 1993). The Alaka`i stronghold is at 1,000-1,600 m. However, the 1968-1973 surveys found the species at lower altitudes in a few areas, and it may not occur above 1,500 m (USFWS 1983, Scott et al. 1986). The species prefers intact forests with a high canopy (Behnke et al. 2016). It feeds on invertebrates (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987), and has been observed excavating rotting wood from the centre of a twig, presumably for insect larvae (VanderWerf and Roberts 2008). Both parents have been observed bringing food to the nest, with the male providing some food for the female, though the female does also forage independently. A nesting pair in 2007 had a juvenile from a previous nest, indicating the species will attempt to raise two broods (VanderWerf and Roberts 2008). ","Lowland forests have been cleared for timber and agriculture, with feral livestock causing further degradation and destruction (USFWS 1983, Scott et al. 1986). Feral pigs continue to be particularly detrimental, additionally dispersing alien plants and facilitating the spread of introduced mosquitoes which transmit avian malaria and avian pox (Scott et al 1986, Pratt 1994, Loope and Medeiros 1995). Domestic and introduced birds provide reservoirs for these diseases, to which there is little resistance in Hawaiian honeycreeper populations (USFWS 1983, Scott et al 1986, Pratt 1994, Lepson 1997). Predation by introduced animals and competition for arthropod resources by introduced taxa (especially Japanese White-eye Zosterops japonicus, wasps and ants) are additional threats (USFWS 1983, Scott et al 1986, Jacobi and Atkinson 1995, Lepson 1997). Introduced plants such as Kahili Ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum), Blackberry (Rubus argutus), Strawberry Guava (Psidium cattleianum), Australian Tree Fern (Cyathea cooperi) and Firetree (Myrica faya) have degraded much native forest in Koke'e, and threaten the remaining habitat. Hurricanes have had major impacts on population size in the past; in 1992 Hurricane Iniki devastated forests throughout Kaua`i, and all bird populations on the island appeared to have been drastically reduced (Pratt 1993, 1994), although some have since recovered. Hurricanes are now thought to displace birds from the small area of suitable habitat at higher elevations and push them into the lowlands where avian malaria is prevalent (Anon. 2007). A growing concern is that rising temperatures could allow mosquitoes to survive at higher altitudes and further transmit avian malaria and avian pox (Anon. 2007) as evidenced by a recent study; over the past two decades there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of avian malaria across the altitudinal range of the Alaka‚Äôi Plateau, which coincides with increasing air temperatures and changing patterns of precipitation and streamflow which support increased transmission of the disease (Atkinson et al. 2014) and having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International unpublished data). ","The most recent population estimate from 2012 is 468 individuals (231-916, 95% CI) (L. Crampton&#160;et al.&#160;in litt. 2015).

During 1968-1973, the total population was estimated at 6,832 (¬±966 standard error), when it was recorded on the Laau ridge and was fairly widespread in Koke'e (USFWS 1983). Since then, the population has declined and the species has retreated from the Koke`e region and the fringes of the Alaka`i region, and is now uncommon to rare in the Alaka`i (Pratt et al. 1987, Pratt 1993, 1994, Behnke et al. 2016). Recent unpublished survey data indicate dramatic declines (85-89% since 1968-1973) and a decline of c. 64% in its core area in the Alaka`i Swamp from 1970 to 2000 (Anon 2007).

Starting in April 2007, the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources conducted population surveys of forest birds on Kaua'i to determine trends. The Zoological Society of San Diego is developing techniques for rearing Oreomystis creepers from eggs and breeding them in captivity, using the related Hawai`i Creeper, at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center (USFWS 2003). The Hawai`i Creeper has been successfully propagated in captivity, and release of the captive population is planned (USFWS 2003, P.

Urgent action is required to halt the decline of this species, which until relatively recently was considered not uncommon.  ","It inhabits wet `ohi`a, `ohi`a/olapa and diverse mesic forest, appearing to tolerate considerable habitat disturbance if sufficient `ohi`a remains (but see Behnke et al. 2016, who found lower occurrence of this species in areas of smaller `ohi`a and greater invasion by non native plants). It is found at 1,050-1,600 m, mostly above 1,100 m, and apparently never occurs in lowland forests. It feeds primarily on spiders and insects, taking nectar very rarely. Breeding occurs at least in March -June, and possibly February; all known nests have been in `ohi`a trees (Lepson and Pratt 1997, Hammond et al. 2015, Kauai Forest Bird Recovery Project, unpubl. data). Mean nest height for ‚ÄòAkeke‚Äòe is 11.1 + 2.3 m SD (Hammond et al. 2015).  ","Development has reduced habitat availability in the Koke`e region, while the spread of exotic plants and feral ungulates is degrading remaining areas (Loope and Medeiros 1995, Lepson and Pratt 1997, VanderWerf 2012). Avian pox and malaria probably cause mortality because introduced mosquitoes (vectors for these diseases) are now common at 900 m, and may breed at 1,200 -1, 400 m (Herrmann and Snetsinger 1997, Lepson 1997, Lepson and Pratt 1997, Glad and Crampton 2015). There is concern that rising average temperatures could allow mosquitoes to survive at higher elevations and increase the exposure of birds to disease (Holmer 2007). A small increase in temperature is predicted to eliminate much of the mosquito-free zone on Kaua`i (U.S. Geological Survey per Holmer 2007) and a recent study has found evidence of this. Over the past two decades there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of avian malaria across the altitudinal range of the Alaka‚Äôi Plateau, which coincides&#160;with&#160; increasing&#160; air temperatures and changing patterns of precipitation and streamflow, &#160;which in turn support increased transmission of the disease (Atkinson et al. 2014). During this time period, prevalence of malaria remained very low in the few ‚ÄòAkeke‚Äôe &#160;individuals sampled, which may indicate high susceptibility to this disease (Atkinson et al. 2014). It is predicted that by 2100, there will be no ‚Äúclimatically-suitable‚Äù habitat left for this species on Kauai (Fortini et al. 2015). Food resources may be limited by alien wasps and ants which greatly reduce populations of native arthropods (Lepson and Pratt 1997). Introduced birds may also be competitors and introduced predators (particularly rats) probably cause some mortality (Lepson and Pratt 1997). &#160;However, Hammond et al. (2015) observed no predation by rats on the eight nests they monitored, although two nests failed due to failure of the eggs to hatch. Adverse weather may be a significant limiting factor, e.g. prolonged, heavy rains which can result in nesting failure and cause massive mortality among fledglings and juveniles (Lepson and Pratt 1997). Two recent hurricanes resulted in serious damage to Kaua`i's forests (Pratt 1994). ‚ÄòAkeke‚Äôe appear to avoid, to some extent, areas that have suffered more hurricane damage, and thus have few, large trees; and areas that have been heavily invaded by weeds (Behnke et al. 2016).","The most recent population estimate is from 2012 when the number of individuals was estimated at 945 (460-1,547, 95% CI) (Paxton et al. 2016).

It was common throughout upper elevation forests in the late 19th century and was thought to be stable at c.20,650 individuals up until the mid 1990s, although its habitat declined in extent over this time period (USFWS 1983, Scott et al. 1986, Lepson and Pratt 1997, S. Fretz et al. in litt. 2003). However, in 2000, surveys indicated that the population had decreased to 7,839 ¬±704 individuals, which dropped to 5,669 ¬± 1,003 individuals in 2005, 3,536 ¬± 1,030 in 2007 and 945 individuals (460-1,547, 95% CI) in 2012 (Paxton et al. 2016).&#160;Even allowing for the large error estimates this indicates a dramatic decline (Holmer 2007, D. Kuhn per Holmer 2007, D. Pratt per Holmer 2007, VanderWerf 2007). It occurs at the highest density in the remote Alaka`i region,&#160;especially the southeastern part of this region (Behnke et al. 2016), and also occurs in the upper Waimea and Koke`e regions; an isolated population persisted in the Makaleha Mountains until at least the early 1970s (Scott et al. 1986, Lepson and Pratt 1997).&#160;In the core of its range its presence is associated with large trees and native shrub cover (Behnke et al. 2016).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions Underway&#160;Some of the current range is protected by Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve, Hono O&#160;NƒÅ&#160;Pali Natural Area Reserve (NAR) and, to some extent, by Koke`e State Park.&#160;Portions of the Preserve have been/are being/will be included in ungulate proof fences in the next five years and post fence-completion, ungulates will be eradicated from these areas.

In 2010 ‚ÄòAkeke‚Äôe &#160;was added to the endangered species list (Foote 2010).&#160;In April 2007, the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources began to conduct population surveys of forest birds on Kaua`i to verify anecdotal evidence of a recent crash in the species's numbers (Holmer 2007). A captive breeding programme was started in 2015, as a collaboration between Kauai Forest Bird Recovery Project, State Department of Land and Natural Resources' Division of Forestry and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service - Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office and San Diego Zoo Global (Buley 2015, L. Crampton et al.&#160;in litt. 2015). Eggs are harvested from wild nests and the chicks hatched at San Diego Zoo Global's facilities in Hawaii (Buley 2015). The captive population currently numbers four birds (B. Masuda, pers. comm). &#160;Rodent control with GoodNature A24 self-resetting traps has also been initiated in the Halehaha area, with preliminary results suggesting rat numbers have declined (Elsel 2016, L.

Crampton et al.&#160;in litt. 2015). Continue to conduct population surveys, especially in peripheral parts of its range&#160;and areas likely to have high densities of the species. Research basic ecology. Prevent further habitat degradation and restore habitat. Control and prevent further introductions of alien species; fence out and remove invasive species (Holmer 2007).

262,North America,Telespiza ultima,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PASSERIFORMES,AVES,FRINGILLIDAE,Telespiza,ultima,B1ac(iv),"This species is listed as Critically Endangered because it has an extremely small range, restricted to one island, where the population exhibits marked population fluctuations, probably owing to climatic events. The accidental introduction of mammalian predators, non-native pest plants, insects or an avian disease, or a stochastic event such as a hurricane could rapidly bring about its extinction. ","It occurs in low shrubs and grasses and is evenly distributed across the island (Morin et al. 1997, Gorresen et al. 2016). It feeds on seeds, invertebrates, other plant parts and eggs (Berger 1972, Morin and Conant 2002). It nests in cavities in cliffs, rock crevices or in piles of loose rock (Berger 1972, Morin and Conant 2002). The clutch size is usually three (range 2-5), but little is known about nesting behaviour or success. There is no information on adult survival or movements (VanderWerf 2012).","It is thought that the presence of the introduced grasshopper Schistocerca nitens on Nihoa, and its periodic irruptions which lead to the virtual defoliation of the island, may be a significant threat to the species. Other potential threats include the introduction of detrimental non-native species and diseases, as well as stochastic events (Berger 1972, James and Olson 1991, Morin et al. 1997, H. Baker and P. Baker in litt. 1999), such as droughts, storms and hurricanes. Black rats caused the extirpation of translocated Laysan Finches T. ultima when they arrived on Midway in 1944 (VanderWerf 2012). Fire is a past and potential threat (Morin et al. 1997, J. Lepson in litt. 1999). A few individuals of the invasive weed Cenchrus echinatus were discovered on Nihoa in 2011 and removed (VanderWerf et al. 2011), and little regrowth was observed in 2012 (VanderWerf 2012). This plant reduces habitat quality and so is a potential threat to the species. T. cantans is known to be highly susceptible to mosquito-borne avian poxvirus (Poxvirus avium) and avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum), and considering its close relationship T. ultima is presumably similarly susceptible. Mosquitoes are not known to occur on Nihoa or Laysan, but are present on Midway and all the larger Hawaiian islands and thus are relevant to selecting sites for translocations (VanderWerf 2012).","VanderWerf (2012) estimated 4,475 ¬±909 birds, which very roughly equates to 3,000 (2,400-3,600) mature individuals. This is larger than the previous estimate of 1,400-2,400 mature individuals, which was based on an estimate of 2,807 ¬±744 (95% CI) individuals in March 2007.",Stable,"Telespiza ultima once occurred at least on the island of Moloka'i in the Main Hawaiian Islands, but was extirpated in prehistory probably by a combination of predation by introduced mammals and habitat loss (Morin and Conant 2002). Today, this species is restricted to the steep, rocky island of Nihoa in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.) (Berger 1972, Morin et al. 1997). Numbers fluctuate (James and Olson 1991, Morin and Conant 2002), although some variation may be due to differences in survey methods and time of year. Numbers on Nihoa have ranged from 6,686 in 1968 to 946 in 1987 (James and Olson 1991, Morin and Conant 2002). The most recent population estimate based on surveys in 2012 is 4,475 (¬±909, 95% CI) individuals (VanderWerf 2012), which very roughly equates to 3,000 (2,400-3,600) mature individuals.",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIt is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Nihoa is part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and the Papah√¢naumoku√¢kea Marine National Monument, and legal access is controlled by a permit system that is restricted largely to biologists, researchers and cultural practitioners. Strict protocols are followed to ensure that permitted visitors do not accidentally introduce new species via seeds, eggs or insects travelling on clothes and equipment. Visiting scientists make regular efforts to control one of the three species of alien plant on Nihoa by hand weeding (Morin et al. 1997). An attempted introduction to French Frigate Shoals in 1967 failed (Berger 1972). A process to evaluate and prioritise potential translocation sites throughout the archipelago for this species (and the other two Northwestern Hawaiian Island passerines) is currently underway. Disease susceptibility may preclude reintroduction of the Nihoa Finch to the Main Hawaiian Islands, and translocation efforts may focus on the Northwestern Islands.Conservation Actions ProposedContinue monitoring, and establish a captive-breeding programme (see Collar and Butchart 2013). Ensure strict protocols prevent further accidental introductions of alien species. Introduce a population to Kure Atoll and (following removal of mice and mosquitos) to Midway Atoll. Restore another island for future translocation. Ensure that the incipient population of Cenchrus echinatus is eradicated from Nihoa and continue to monitor for its presence (VanderWerf 2012). Develop and implement a method of monitoring abundance of the grasshopper Schistocerca nitens on Nihoa, including herbivory levels and plant species cover (VanderWerf 2012).&#160;",Oceanian,,False,False,Global,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
263,North America,Gymnogyps californianus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CATHARTIFORMES,AVES,CATHARTIDAE,Gymnogyps,californianus,C2a(i);D,"After the removal of all surviving birds into captivity in 1987, an intensive conservation programme involving reintroduction and release of captive-bred birds has led to a very small but increasing population of this species in the wild. However, the population in the wild remains dependent on intensive conservation management efforts. The species consequently qualifies as Critically Endangered.  ","Its range includes rocky, open-country scrubland, coniferous forest and oak savanna. Cliffs, rocky outcrops or large trees are used as nest sites (USFWS 1996). It scavenges on the carcasses of large mammals and also feeds on the carcasses of small mammals, but perhaps only where there are sufficient numbers at one site (L. Kiff in litt. 2009). Released birds have become increasingly independent in finding food and may range more than 400 km from release sites (Anon. 1998), though the distance an individual ranges can vary depending on season and individuals released at different sites have shown significantly different home range sizes (Rivers et al. 2014), suggesting local ecological factors may play a role.","The drastic population decline during the 20th century is principally attributed to persecution and accidental ingestion of fragments from lead bullets and lead shot from carcasses (C. N. Parish in litt. 2012), resulting in lead poisoning. Lead poisoning remains a key threat for released birds (Kelly et al. 2014) and has caused many fatalities and resulted in the treatment of many more birds (Anon. 2001, Parish et al. 2007, Walters et al. 2010); 9 of 13 birds released at the Pinnacles National Monument in California had to be recaptured and tested for lead poisoning after feasting on a field of squirrel carcasses shot by hunters using lead-shot in 2006. It is particularly prone to the threat of lead-poisoning owing to its longevity and delayed-onset breeding strategy, and given the distances it travels to forage, meaning lead can build up in the blood to dangerous levels over many years having been ingested over a broad area (Hunt et al. 2007). Shooting and accidental poisoning continue to be the principal threats to condors and at current levels threaten the long-term sustainability of reintroduced populations (Cade 2007), but lead ammunition is being banned within the species's range in California and there are increasing indications that the federal government will gradually phase out the use of lead across the U.S. Despite efforts to reduce the threat of lead-poisoning, it is reported that over 90% of condors released in Arizona still test positive for lead (Toops 2009) and in January 2010 three birds were found to have died from lead-poisoning in northern Arizona. A study conducted in California, using samples collected in 2004-2009, suggests that around one third of condors in the region are experiencing toxicological effects from lead ammunition (Finkelstein et al. 2012). A study using samples collected between 1997 and 2011 showed that blood lead concentrations increased as birds became less reliant on provisioned food, as they became older and as their home range size increased (Kelly&#160;et al. 2014). In 2017, 69 of the 78 birds in the Arizona/Utah population showed high levels of lead exposure; despite a treatment, two individuals died from severe lead-poisoning (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). In preparation of a potential release at new sites in northern California, a study found that Common Ravens Corvus corax&#160;and Turkey Vultures Cathartes aura&#160;in the region still suffered from high lead contamination (West et al. 2017). Publicity and awareness raising campaigns appear to have successfully reduced persecution.&#160;The population along the Central Pacific Californian coast also suffers from reduced eggshell thickness, consistent with the effects of the breakdown compounds of the pesticide DDT, compromising reproduction in the wild (Burnett et al. 2013). Apparently restricted to this population, it is thought that this is linked to feeding on the carcasses of predatory marine mammals that had been exposed to the pesticide from a specific point source during their lifetimes (Burnett et al. 2013, Kurle et al. 2016). The lack of additional DDT inputs suggests that these effects will decrease over time, though at present this is a further significant impediment to sustainable wild reproduction in this population. Ingested anthropogenic material was recently responsible for the deaths of two nestlings and strongly implicated in a number of other deaths. The dead condors were found to have swallowed glass fragments, wire, plastic cartridge cases, etc. (Mee et al. 2007). Two birds were shot in California in 2009. Both were alive as of April 2009, both being treated for lead poisoning (Anon. 2009). Puppet-reared birds may be more prone to exhibit problematic human-oriented behaviour such as tameness and vandalising property than parent-reared birds (Meretsky et al. 2000). However, there is no apparent difference in mortality between released birds that were puppet-reared and those which were parent-reared (Woods et al. 2007). In the early 1990s a number of captive-reared birds were lost owing to collisions with power-lines, but this behavioural problem has been addressed using a conditioning programme with fake power poles (L. Kiff in litt. 2005). The spread of west Nile virus is not anticipated to be a problem for the species as most birds are vaccinated (L. Kiff in litt. 2005). Overall survival of released birds has been high, although without the capture, treatment and re-release of lead contaminated birds it is likely that rates of mortality in the wild still exceed sustainable levels (Walters et al. 2010, L. Kiff in litt. 2009). ","There are currently 106 adults in the wild that are old enough to breed, and 44 have produced viable offspring (J. Grantham in litt. 2010). Since mature individuals (as defined by IUCN) only includes individuals in the wild that are currently capable of reproduction, and re-introduced individuals must have produced viable offspring before they are counted as mature individuals, the current global population sensu IUCN is 44 mature individuals. The wild population currently numbers 231 individuals in total (California Condor Recovery Program 2012).",Increasing,"This species declined rapidly throughout its historic range from British Columbia to Baja California during the 19th century and reportedly disappeared from outside California, U.S.A., in 1937 (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, L. Kiff in litt. 2009). The population had dropped to an all-time low of just 22 birds by 1981, and in 1983 eggs were first taken from wild nests for captive-rearing; in 1987 the species became extinct in the wild when the last of the six wild individuals was captured to join a captive-breeding recovery programme involving 27 birds (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, Toops 2009). Due to intensive captive breeding efforts the population increased to 223 birds by August 2003, comprising 138 in captivity, and 85 reintroduced in California and northern Arizona (L. Kiff in litt. 2003). Breeding in the wild resumed in 2002, and by February 2009 56 nesting attempts had been recorded, from which at least 19 chicks have fledged and survived (L. Kiff in litt. 2009). In December 2003, birds were released at the Pinnacles National Monument in California, where one pair were observed raising chicks in 2009 (Moir 2009). Releases in New Mexico have been abandoned due to lack of funding, and release priorities have shifted to identifying sites and partnerships in southern Sierra Nevada, California (Chu et al. 2003). The regular movements of the Arizona birds are confined to Coconnino County (Arizona) and Kane County (Utah), although one individual wandered north to Flaming Gorge (Wyoming) and localities in Colorado before returning to the Grand Canyon area. The California birds occur regularly in San Bernardino, Los Angeles, Ventura, Kern, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterrey, San Benito, and probably Santa Cruz counties. By December 2006, there were 130 wild birds at five release sites (L. Kiff in litt. 2006, Graham 2006), including at least 44 that were over six years old, the earliest age at which the species breeds (L. Kiff in litt. 2005), and in February 2012, the total population stood at 173 individuals in captivity and 213 in the wild, primarily in southern and central California (Carpentier 2009, C. N. Parish in litt. 2012). In January 2010, the number of released birds that had produced viable offspring stood at 44, with another 60 birds of breeding age (J. Grantham in litt. 2010). By 2017, the total population has increased to 446 birds (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). The Arizona/Utah population now numbers 78 birds, with four birds released in 2017 and another 10 earmarked for release in 2018 (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). The reintroduction programme continues and has expanded its geographic coverage, with six birds released into the Sierra de San Pedro Martir in Baja California, Mexico in 2002 (USFWS 2002). A release site in Baja was established in October 2003. The first chick born in Mexico for over 75 years hatched in April 2007. The Baja California birds are largely confined to the Sierra de San Pedro Martir (L. Kiff in litt. 2006), where efforts are ongoing to increase the population to an anticipated carrying capacity of c.20 pairs (Wallace 2005). It is hoped these birds will range widely enough to be effectively connected with birds in the southern U.S.A., and a bird from the Baja population was seen in San Diego County in April 2007. 2015 was an important year for the species in terms of its recovery in the wild as it was the first year when the number of individuals that died in the wild was less than the number of juveniles that fledged (Silber 2016). Second generation birds have recently matured to breeding age, but no population can be deemed sustainable, and without substantial reductions in the use of lead-based ammunition within the condor's range none are likely to become so (Finkelstein et al. 2012). The recovery programme for the species continues to address threats to the wild population, but lead contamination remains the greatest of these threats (C. Battistone in litt. 2016).&#160;",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I and II. A large-scale, integrated captive-breeding and reintroduction programme, managed by the Peregrine Fund (at the World Center for Birds of Prey), Los Angeles Zoo, Oregon Zoo and San Diego Wild Animal Park is preventing extinction in the wild. The success of the scheme has seen an increase from one chick hatched in 1988 to an annual hatch of 25-30 birds in recent years (Wallace 2004). The genetic diversity of the population has been maintained through careful distribution and representation of founder genotypes at each captive-breeding facility and reintroduction site. Consequently the current population retains 99.5% of the likely heterozygosity of a wild panmictic population (Ralls and Ballou 2004). ""Aversion training"" to avoid powerlines and humans is practised (USFWS 1996). A total of 154 condors were released into the wild between 1992 and 2003 (Wallace 2004). Clean carcasses are provided for reintroduced birds to help prevent lead-poisoning, and community education programmes aim to minimise persecution (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, Anon. 1998). However, as the recovery of the species has continued, individuals are now ranging further than before and are less likely to take the food provided for them (Bakker et al. 2017). A huge step has been taken towards eliminating the threat of lead-poisoning with the signing in 2007 of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, which requires the use of non-lead ammunition within the species's range in California and was implemented in 2008. As of February 2009, 99% of hunters were compliant with the act. The Arizona Game and Fish Department is now distributing safer lead-substitute bullets free of charge to hunters within the foraging range of the condors; similar programmes are being initiated in California (L. Kiff in litt. 2005) and Utah. Public awareness and engagement are continuing to increase, working toward the elimination of lead ammunition and the removal of lead-tainted carcasses from the field (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). By 2019, a California-wide ban of lead ammunition is scheduled to go into effect (West et al. 2017). Publicity measures include a website and near-weekly condor articles in local newspapers (D. Cooper and J. Grantham in litt. 2003). In 2008 an agreement was struck between the Tejon Ranch and five conservation organisations to preserve 240,000 acres of the 270,000 acre property as an open space in return for not opposing the development of the remaining land, providing a vast amount of foraging habitat for the condor (L. Kiff in litt. 2009). Legislation coming into force in early 2010 made it illegal for persons to enter a U.S. national park with a loaded firearm (Toops 2009).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor population trends. Continue the recovery plan to achieve two disjunct, self-sustaining populations of 150 individuals comprising 15 breeding pairs. Identify further potential release sites in southern New Mexico (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, USFWS 1996, Anon. 1998). Resume release programme in Mexico and establish new release sites in northern California. Maintain and increase the productivity of the captive population. Continue releases of captive-bred birds. Maintain suitable habitat (USFWS 1996, Anon. 1998). Continue supplemental feeding (Walters et al. 2010). Continue and expand information and education programmes (USFWS 1996, Anon. 1998, Walters et al. 2010). Continue supplying alternative lead-free ammunition to deer hunters. Advocate strongly for a ban on lead ammunition and lobby the Fish and Game Commission to ensure legislation is passed. Encourage the USFWS to promote the elimination of lead ammunition on land administered by other government agencies.

It breeds during the boreal winter, as the specimens found so far on land and calling from burrows and nesting have been in the period December to May (Kawakami et al. 2012, Fjelds√• 2013, Pyle et al. 2014). The nesting individuals recorded on Higashijima in February 2015 were found in a mosaic of scrub forest and grassland, consisting of Screw Pine Pandanus boninensis and Bonin Silver Grass Miscanthus boninensis (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015). The nest site was a burrow in grassland. The individual recorded on Midway Atoll in 1991 was found in a crevice in rocky habitat (Pyle et al. 2014). To date, it has only been found on small islands. It may co-utilize nesting sites with Bulwer's Petrel Bulweria bulwerii (Pyle et al. 2014).","Introduced Black Rats Rattus rattus pose a considerable threat to the species, being present on more than 20 islands in the Bonin group (Kawakami et al. 2012). On Higashijima Island, three carcasses of Bryan‚Äôs Shearwater were found that had been depredated by rats and it is suspected that the paucity of records of the species may be a result of rat predation (Kawakami et al. 2012, Fjelds√• 2013). Predation of smaller seabirds by rats on Higashijima dramatically increased in 2005, attributed to a shift in the foraging behaviour of the rats (Kawakami et al. 2012). The Ministry of Environment responded to the mass depredation of small petrels by initiating a rat eradication program on Higashijima in 2008, which has apparently been successful, with no rats observed since 2010 (Kawakami et al. 2012). Rats are also absent from Kitanoshima Island, but remain in large parts of the species‚Äô range. Eradication of rats from these islands would be necessary for these areas to be suitable as breeding locations (Kawakami et al. 2012, Fjelds√• 2013). Invasive plant species, Casuarina equisetifolia and Leucaena leucocephala, may also have impacted breeding success on Higashijima, as they invade the breeding habitat and alter the environment (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015). The Forest Agency has eradicated almost all matured C. equisetifolia so far and is conducting an eradication program for L. leucocephala. Light pollution is another potential threat. It is a significant cause of mortality in Newell‚Äôs Shearwater Puffinus newelli, and two of the six P. bryani specimens that were located in the Bonin Island prior to 2015 were collected after apparent disorientation due to artificial lighting.","The species's population size has not been quantified, but given its apparent rarity it is thought to have an extremely small population, probably numbering fewer than 250 mature individuals. The population is therefore placed in the band 50-249 mature individuals, assumed to equate to a total population of c.70-380 individuals.",Decreasing,"The species is currently only known from individuals found in burrows on Midway Island in the north-western Hawaiian chain, U.S.A., and in the Bonin Islands (Ogasawara Islands), Japan. The species was described from an individual collected in 1963 on Midway Island, with another individual of this species observed on Midway during the winters of 1990-1991 and 1991-1992. It is considered unlikely that the species is regularly breeding on Midway or other Hawaiian atolls, as the seabird colonies there have been studied in detail and appropriate natural breeding habitat is lacking (Pyle et al. 2011, 2014). Subsequent analysis of specimens from the Bonin Islands suggests that its main breeding range is within that group, although much exploration is still to be done (Kawakami et al. 2012). In February 2015, 10 birds and at least one nest were discovered on Higashijima in the Bonin Islands (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015), after calls were detected there and on other Bonin Islands with passive acoustic sensors in 2012-2014. Prior to 2012, five of the six individuals recorded on the Bonin Islands had been corpses, three of which had been predated by Black Rats Rattus rattus (Kawakami et al. 2012, Fjelds√• 2013). The at-sea distribution is effectively unknown, although at minimum it transits through the tropical or subtropical waters of the central western Pacific Ocean between the north-western Hawaiian chain and the Bonin Islands. Its apparent rarity suggests that the population is extremely small.",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayHigashijima is an IBA. It is protected by the Forestry Agency and access to the island is restricted (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015). Rats have already been eradicated on Higashijima, following a program of poisoned bait application between 2008 and 2010 (Kawakami et al. 2012). Currently, there is an eradication programme ongoing , as detailed for each island in the Ogawasara Islands Ecosystem Conservation Action Plan (Anon. 2010). Work is ongoing to remove introduced plant species on Higashijima. A careful investigation of known seabird colonies in the subtropical/tropical western Pacific may reveal additional records. Street lights that reduce light pollution have been installed in residential areas in the Bonin Islands to reduce disturbance to the species (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015).&#160;Conservation Actions ProposedSurvey seabird colonies on Higashijima and Kitanoshima to confirm additional breeding sites for this species. Examine other known seabird colonies in the subtropical west Pacific for evidence of this species, in particular northern Marianas, Nihoa and Necker Islands and the north-west Hawaiian islands with habitats that support Bulwer's Petrel which may co-utilize breeding crevices with Bryan's Shearwaters (Pyle et al. 2014). Ensure Higashijima is free of rats. Eradicate rats, goats and pigs from all small islands in the Bonin group. Although feral goats and pigs have already been eradicated from all uninhabited small islands in the Bonin Islands, feral goats continue to exist on the inhabited Chichijima Island.

This is because of a number of factors, including habitat loss in its breeding, passage and wintering grounds, which are compounded by disturbance, pollution, hunting and the effects of climate change. Juvenile recruitment has, until recently, been very low, leading to fears that the population is ageing rapidly; action is now urgently required to prevent the extinction of this species.  ","The species has a very specialised breeding habitat, using only lagoon spits with crowberry-lichen vegetation or dwarf birch and willow sedges, together with adjacent estuary or mudflat habitats that are used as feeding sites by adults during nesting. The species has never been recorded breeding further than 5 km (and exceptionally once 7 km) from the sea shore. Breeding birds are very site-faithful. It breeds either in single pairs or loose aggregations (Z√∂ckler et al. 2008). It nests in June-July (Van Gils et al. 2015), with failed breeders potentially leaving on migration before others (Zhang Lin 2016). During winter, it prefers mixed sandy tidal mudflats with an uneven surface and very shallow water, mainly in the outermost parts of river deltas and outer islands, often with a higher sand content and thin mud layer on top. In the areas with total coastal conversion, it favours certain stages in the management of saltpans (Z√∂ckler et al. 2008). The species feeds by plover-style pecking and occasionally probing (Z√∂ckler et al. 2008), also appearing to use its bill as a shovel (Bird et al. 2010). Evidence to support suspicions that immature birds spend their first summer on the wintering grounds until their second year come from ringing recoveries (Tomkovich 1995, Z√∂ckler et al. 2010a), photographs of a second calendar-year bird in Thailand in July 2010 (G. Chutima in litt. 2010) and another individual in Bangladesh in June 2015 (S. U. Chowdhury in litt. 2016).","Throughout its migratory and wintering ranges, tidal flats are being reclaimed for coastal development (industry, leisure, infrastructure, aquaculture and agriculture) and are becoming increasingly polluted. The important staging area at Saemangeum and Geum estuary, South Korea, including the Mangyeung and Tongjin estuaries, has already been reclaimed, and remaining wetlands are under serious threat of reclamation in the near future (Z√∂ckler et al. 2008). Since the reclamation at Saemangeum in 2007, only an average of a single individual has been recorded, in contrast to 'hundreds' prior to the development (Lee et al. 2018). Plans for a large-scale reclamation project on the Tiaozini Sandbanks, (part of the Rudong mudflats) could lead to the loss of 26,680 ha of tidal flat, whilst two connected projects could lead to additional losses of 40,000 ha by 2020 (Moores 2015,&#160;J. Li and M. Tong to C.&#160;Z√∂ckler&#160;in litt. 2016, Peng et al. 2017), although the project is currently on hold (J. Li to C.&#160;Z√∂ckler in litt. 2016). Additional reclamation is happening elsewhere at Rudong, with new seawalls present in 2015 (Z√∂ckler 2015, Peng et al. 2017). However, the national announcement of an end to the reclamation of intertidal land in January 2018 (Anon. 2018, Lei 2018) appears to be a dramatic shift towards alleviating new impacts from this threat. Smooth Cord-grass&#160;Spartina alterniflora&#160;is an invasive plant used to stabilise mudflats to assist in reclamation along the Chinese coast and rapidly leaves intertidal areas unsuitable for Spoon-billed Sandpipers, dramatically reducing habitat availability (Menxiu et al. 2012, Peng et al. 2017). At both Rudong and Dongling, Spartina alterniflora has formed dense stands with considerable spread noted between spring 2014 and autumn 2015 (Peng et al. 2017), and it has also been found on Leizhou mudflat (V. Fu&#160;in litt.&#160;2017). The Rudong mudflats are also&#160;the site for development of the largest wind farm in Asia, which could prove to be another threat to this species (C. Z√∂ckler&#160;in litt.&#160;2007, 2009, 2010, Li et al. undated).&#160;Plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia and cross-dams along the coast of Bangladesh continue to pose threats (Bird et al. 2010, Chowdhury et al. 2011, Z√∂ckler 2015); however, this plan is currently on hold and plans to protect the area have been developed (Z√∂ckler&#160;2015).Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh and Myanmar (C. Z√∂ckler in litt. 2007, 2009,&#160;Z√∂ckler and Htin Hla 2009,&#160;Bird et al. 2010, Chowdhury 2010, C. Z√∂ckler in litt. 2010, Z√∂ckler et al. 2010b), and this may be a particularly serious threat to birds wintering on Nan Thar Island and in the Gulf of Martaban, Myanmar (C. Z√∂ckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010, Z√∂ckler et al. 2010b). A survey of hunting activities in five villages around Sonadia Island, Bangladesh, in September 2010 found that of the 53 hunters interviewed, eight of them claimed to have caught a total of 22 Spoon-billed Sandpipers between October 2009 and April 2010 (Chowdhury 2010). Hunting in the species's non-breeding range could be a crucial factor in the poor rate of recruitment into the breeding population, as immature birds do not return to the breeding areas until they are two years old and thus are more exposed to capture (Z√∂ckler et al. 2010b). However, recent conservation action aimed at reducing trapping on the wintering grounds appears to have been successful (Clark et al. 2014) and may have reduced this significant source of mortality (D. Pain in litt. 2016).&#160;Large-scale wader trapping was observed at Fucheng, south-west Guangdong province, China, where four Spoon-billed Sandpiper were observed in December 2012 (BirdLife Asia 2013), but surveys for the species in south China in January 2017 did not find any illegal mist nets (V. Fu in litt. 2017). Monofilament fishing nets set over high tides were found to be a serious problem on the central Chinese coast, with multiple parallel lines of nets set at Tiaozini&#160;in autumn 2015 were found to have captured scores of birds after just one nocturnal high tide, including one juvenile Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Peng et al. 2017).&#160;Hunting with nets has also been reported from Viet Nam (Long 2015).&#160;Between August and October 2014, more than a thousand dead wading birds, including two Spoon-billed Sandpipers, were found on the Tiaozini Sandbanks (Z√∂ckler&#160;et al. 2015, Peng et al. 2017). Tests are ongoing to understand the cause of mortality; however, poisoned bait was discovered in the area.There are no immediate threats to the breeding grounds, but nests in the vicinity of villages are sometimes destroyed by dogs (E. Syroechkovskiy in litt. 2007). Poor breeding productivity in recent years has been attributed to heavy nest predation and bad weather (Syroechkovskiy et al. 2009). Significant habitat degradation has been observed in 5 of 30 visited breeding locations (C. Z√∂ckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010). Human disturbance, both by residents and researchers, may cause increased levels of nest desertion and predation by foxes and skuas (Z√∂ckler and Bunting 2006). Shorebirds, including this species, are also occasionally killed by children with slingshots (Z√∂ckler and Bunting 2006); one male was also shot by a Russian hunter near the Chinese border in 2008 (Z√∂ckler and Syroechkovskiy 2008). Small but significant numbers of birds and their eggs have been collected for scientific purposes in the last 20 years, with one small colony completely wiped out due to this activity (Z√∂ckler and Bunting 2006). Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and other species dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 57% of the breeding habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Z√∂ckler and Lysenko 2000). ","The breeding population in 2009/2010 was estimated at 120-200 pairs, roughly equivalent to 240-400 mature individuals and 360-600 individuals in total, although this is thought to be an optimistic estimate. Recent estimates put the population at no more than 120 pairs (or 242-378 individuals) based on wintering numbers (Z√∂ckler et al. 2016) and breeding surveys (Syroechkovskiy et al. in litt. to&#160;Z√∂ckler&#160;et al. 2016), or at 210-228 pairs (Clark et al. 2018). Therefore, the population size is placed here in the range of 240-456 mature individuals (120-228 pairs), roughly equivalent to 360-684 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species has a naturally limited breeding range on the Chukotsk peninsula and southwards to the isthmus of the Kamchatka peninsula, in north-eastern Russia (BirdLife International 2001). It migrates down the western Pacific coast through Russia, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, mainland China, Hong Kong (China), Taiwan (China) and Viet Nam, to its main wintering grounds in southern China, Viet Nam, Thailand,&#160;Bangladesh and Myanmar (Z√∂ckler et al. 2016). Wintering birds have also been recorded from India (with a recent sighting in 2018 possibly the first for 70 years [Roy 2018]), Sri Lanka, the Fujian province in China (the Min Jiang estuary in Fujian has recently been identified as an important wintering site for the species [F. Cheung in litt. 2010, Bai et al. 2015,&#160;Z√∂ckler&#160;et al. 2016]), Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of China&#160;(Fu 2015), and peninsular&#160;Malaysia. It occurs regularly at only a few sites within this wintering range, with important sites in Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar and China. Sonadia Island and Meghna Estuary (Bangladesh), the Gulf of Martaban and Nan Thar (Myanmar) are believed to support over half of the wintering population (Clark&#160;et al. 2014,&#160;Z√∂ckler&#160;et al. 2016,&#160;Chowdhury et al. 2018); over 80% of the entire population are considered to winter in Myanmar and Bangladesh (Z√∂ckler&#160;et al. 2016). Records of wintering birds in&#160;Myanmar are of 84 individuals in 2007-2008, 73 in January 2009 (Clark 2009), and 89 in 2010 (Z√∂ckler et al. 2010b); 150-220 in the Bay of Martaban in 2010-2012&#160;(Z√∂ckler et al. 2010a, b, 2014) and approximately 155 in the upper bay of Martaban in January 2015 (Clark 2015). In February 2016, an estimated 100 individuals were present in the upper Gulf of Mottama, Myanmar (Anderson et al. 2016). In March-April 2010, a minimum total of 49 individuals were recorded during targeted surveys along the coast of Bangladesh (Bird et al. 2010, Chowdhury et al. 2011). Surveys along the Bangladesh coast from December 2015 to February 2016 found a record number of a minimum of 76 individuals from different sites along the coast, the highest numbers recorded since 1989 in Bangladesh (Chowdhury 2016). During the winter of 2015-2016, it was estimated that 10 adults used the Gulf of Thailand (K. Sutasha in litt. 2016). Recent findings on the Leizhou Peninsula suggest a large wintering population of about 50 birds there (Martinez and Allcock 2016, C. Z√∂ckler in litt. 2016). A new site along the Meghna Estuary was discovered in 2015, which supported a minimum of 48 individuals in February 2016 (Chowdhury et al. 2018). It is likely that a large proportion of the adult population of the species spends time at Rudong, China, in both autumn and spring (Menxiu&#160;et al. 2012, Clark et al. 2014). It is currently the only known moulting site for the species (Bai et al. 2015). Counts of up to 103 individuals at Rudong in October 2011, 106 in October 2012, 140 in October 2013 (Z√∂ckler and Li 2013), a minimum of 226 in September 2014 and 177-190 in October 2014 (Z√∂ckler et al. 2015) are likely to have accounted for a substantial proportion of the global population (M. Tong in litt. 2011). A maximum of 100 birds were recorded on the Tiaozini mudflats (part of the Rudong mudflats), Dongtai County, in October 2014 (Z√∂ckler et al. 2015), with more than 100 birds recorded at Tiaozini in October 2015 (Li and Chowdhury 2016). A survey in May 2015 on the Rudong mudflats recorded at least 62 individuals, including a number of head-started birds (Phillips 2015). Modelling work has shown Rudong to be too far for the species to reach in a single flight from its breeding grounds and work is underway to identify another stopover site in the Russian Far East (Clark et al. 2014).&#160;China Coastal Waterbird Surveys conducted between 2005 and 2013 (Bai et al. 2015) identified the following sites as of international importance for the species: Yalu Jliang estuarine wetland (Liaoning), Rudong coast (Jiangsu), Dongtai coast (Jiangsu), Dongling coast (Jiangsu), Minjiang Estuary National Nature Reserve (Fujian), Dadeng Island and Weitou Bay (Fujian) and Xitou coast (Guangdong).Due to its specialised breeding habitat requirements, it was probably always a scarce species, but numbers dropped rapidly, at least between 2000 and 2010 (D. Pain in litt. 2016). Surveys on the breeding grounds revealed a dramatic decline from 2,000-2,800 pairs in the 1970s to fewer than 1,000 pairs in 2000, 402-572 pairs in 2003, 350-380 pairs in 2005 (Z√∂ckler and Bunting 2006) and not more than 150-320 pairs in 2008. The breeding population in 2009-2010 was optimistically estimated at 120-200 pairs (Bird et al. 2010, Z√∂ckler et al. 2010a) in an estimated total population of 500-800 individuals, perhaps indicating an 88% decline since 2002, equating to an annual rate of decline of 26% (Z√∂ckler et al. 2010a). These declines have taken place across all known breeding sites, and it is unlikely that significant colonies remain undiscovered (Z√∂ckler 2005, Z√∂ckler and Bunting 2006). Declines were also observed at wintering grounds. For example, no birds were sighted wintering in Viet Nam in 2009 at a site that supported at least 27 birds in the mid 1990s (E. Syroechkovskiy et al. in litt. 2009). However, over the last few years (2013-2015), there are signs that active conservation interventions may have stemmed this rapid population decline and the small remaining population appears to have stabilised, at least temporarily (D. Pain in litt. 2016).Breeding success is quite low: average productivity was 0.66 young fledged per nest in 2005, and much lower in 2007, and this is compounded by a very low rate of juveniles and adults returning to the breeding grounds. Until recently, the species has had an ageing and rapidly declining population with little recruitment (D. Pain in litt. 2016). For example, data collected on birds at one breeding area from 2003 to 2009 suggest that recruitment into the adult breeding population was effectively zero in all years apart from 2005 and 2007 (Z√∂ckler et al. 2010a). In 2013, for the first time there was no decline detected at the core breeding area of Meinypylgino, where the population was stable at c.10 pairs (Z√∂ckler 2013). In June 2014, an expedition to Russkaya Koshka recorded an increase in the number of breeding territories from a low of 1-2 pairs to five (Nitschke et al. 2015), but numbers are still not near levels known from the early 2000s (Tomkovich et al. 2002, C. Z√∂ckler in litt. 2016). In July 2016, an expedition in Kamchatka located a previously unknown breeding area for the species (Heritage Expeditions 2016).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I and II. Fourteen sites along the coast of Bohai Gulf and the Yellow Sea in China have been nominated for World Heritage Site status. Protected areas in its breeding, staging and wintering areas include Moroshechnaya and several local wildlife refuges on the Chukotsk peninsula (Russia), Yancheng and Chongming Dongtan (China), Mai Po (Hong Kong), Lanyang estuary (Taiwan), Point Calimere and Chilka lake (India), and Xuan Thuy Nature Reserve (Vietnam). The Bird Conservation Society of Thailand have lobbied the Government of Thailand to request that Khok Kham be designated a Ramsar site (Fowlie 2011). The Gulf of Mottama, Myanmar has also been proposed as a Ramsar site and the area belonging to Mon State is soon to be designated (Clark et al. 2014, Z√∂ckler 2015). Work by the group 'SBS in China' recently lead to the local government designating a 10,000 ha area for Spoon-billed Sandpipers in Rudong (Clark et al. 2014). Shellfish protected areas have also been designated, which will provide suitable feeding habitat for birds and protect local livelihoods. Annual surveys of breeding sites on Chukotka are undertaken and over 450 adults and young have been ringed on the breeding grounds since 2000 (Z√∂ckler et al. 2008). Annual searches of potential new breeding sites have taken place from 2011 to at least 2013 (Z√∂ckler 2013).A range of awareness and outreach programmes have taken place. Local support groups have been established in some breeding areas and negotiations have taken place to reduce short-term hunting pressure at one of the key wintering sites in Myanmar (Z√∂ckler and Htin Hla 2009, Z√∂ckler et al. 2010b). Researchers and a local environmentalist group convinced two villages on Nan Thar Island, Myanmar, to agree to a hunting ban of the species, with a view to develop an ecologically and economically sound alternative in the future (C. Z√∂ckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010, Z√∂ckler et al. 2010b). The development of ecotourism at Nan Thar generated extra income for local people and encouraged them to protect the birds (Clark et al. 2014, Z√∂ckler et al. 2014). In the Bay of Martaban, socio-economic surveys carried out in early 2010 indicated that bird-hunting is undesirable and that most hunters would readily switch to alternative livelihoods if assisted (BANCA 2010). These surveys were swiftly followed by mitigation activities in the same year, in which hunters agreed to stop their activities in exchange for equipment to provide them with an alternative income source, and awareness-raising events and materials were provided for whole communities (BANCA in litt. 2010). On the eastern shore of the Gulf of Martaban, 9 out of 15 hunters targeted by the mitigation activities had increased their livelihood status, the remaining six had neither increased nor decreased their livelihood status (BANCA 2012). Conservationists in Bangladesh successfully raised funds to provide hunters with loans so that they could establish new livelihoods, such as farming (Clark et al. 2014). The Bangladesh Spoon-billed Sandpiper Conservation Project conducted a one year awareness-raising project on Sonadia Island, an important wintering site for the species (Clark et al. 2014). Activities involved former hunters visiting schools to talk about conservation work, film showings, boat races, mural painting and photography exhibitions (S. U. Chowdhury in litt. 2016).&#160;In 2011, awareness-raising and advocacy activities including two training workshops took place in schools in China. Schoolchildren living close to the species's breeding grounds in Russia have also been taught about the species and sent letters to other schoolchildren living along the flyway asking them to protect the species (Clark et al. 2014).&#160;A Species Action Plan was produced in 2006 (Z√∂ckler and Bunting 2006), and updated in 2008 (Z√∂ckler et al. 2008) and 2010 (Z√∂ckler et al. 2010c). At the fifth meeting of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership in Cambodia in December 2010, the partners agreed to establish a Task Force for this species, charged with implementing the action plan (Fowlie 2011).&#160;In 2012, the 'Saving Spoony's Chinese Wetlands' project came top in a vote organised by the Disney Foundation, winning $100,000 to support conservation efforts for the species (Clark&#160;et al. 2014).&#160;Headstarting, or artificial incubation and captive rearing on the breeding grounds, avoids the high levels of natural predation that occur at egg and chick stage. This significantly increased breeding success, with the number of wild birds fledged increasing by approximately five times per pair (D. Pain&#160;in litt. 2016). In addition, by taking eggs within days of them being laid early in the season, some birds lay a second clutch that they incubate and raise themselves. Headstarting expeditions in 2012 and 2013 have resulted in the release of a total of 25 juveniles from 35 eggs collected (Z√∂ckler 2013). In 2015, 37 eggs were collected for headstarting in Chukotka, of which 35 were fertile (B. Hughes&#160;in litt. 2015). In July 2016, the headstarting programme successfully released 30 fledglings, the most birds released in a single year. This brings the total number of birds released to 111 (Lee 2016).A&#160;captive-rearing and breeding programme started in 2011, when eggs were collected in Chukotka, and the young birds reared in captivity in Russia were subsequently transported to purpose-built conservation breeding facilities at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust headquarters at Slimbridge, UK (Pain 2010). In 2012, eggs were transported from Chukotka direct to Slimbridge (Pain et al. 2011, Donald et al. 2013). In May 2014 the captive population numbered 25 birds (Clark et al. 2014). Two pairs of captive birds at Slimbridge started to breed in 2016 (D. Pain in litt. 2016) and a total of seven eggs were laid, of which two were fertile (Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust 2016). Both eggs hatched in early July 2016 but unfortunately neither chick survived more than 60 hours (Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust 2016).&#160;Conservation Actions ProposedDevelop captive breeding programmes and continue to monitor numbers at known breeding sites and carry out searches of suitable habitat in North Kamchatka. Continue to search for stopover sites in the Russian Far East (Clark&#160;et al. 2014).&#160;Actively prevent collection of eggs and birds for scientific purposes, museums and private collections. Take measures to ensure that researcher activity does not increase mortality. Ensure effective legal protection of all known breeding sites. Survey existing and potential wintering sites in Myanmar and Bangladesh. Stop hunting and trapping at key sites in Myanmar, Bangladesh and Russia. Ensure awareness-raising activities are maintained in the long-term. Ensure protection of newly discovered sites and existing sites, especially in South Korea. Campaign against the continued reclamation of intertidal mudflats along the entire migration route. Restore reclaimed wetland sites. Legally protect it in all range states. Identify and mitigate pressures at breeding grounds. Lobby against plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia, Bangladesh (Bird et al. 2010, Chowdhury 2012) and protect important sites along the Meghna Estuary, Bangladesh (Chowdhury et al. 2018).&#160;Pursue protected area status for the Bay of Martaban and other coastal sites in Myanmar (BANCA in litt. 2010, Z√∂ckler et al. 2014).",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

271,North America,Pristis pristis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,RHINOPRISTIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,PRISTIDAE,Pristis,pristis,A2cd,"The Largetooth Sawfish (Pristis pristis) formerly had a widespread tropical distribution, consisting of four subpopulations (Eastern Atlantic, Western Atlantic, Eastern Pacific and Indo-West Pacific). A recent taxonomic review has shown that P. perotteti (Atlantic) and P. microdon (Indo-West Pacific) are synonymous with P. pristis and this Red List assessment replaces the previous (2006) assessments for those species. The Largetooth Sawfish is a large (6.5+ m total length) euryhaline species, with juveniles occurring in freshwater systems and adults in marine and estuarine environments (although in Lake Nicaragua, individuals spent much, if not all, of their lives in freshwater). All subpopulations have undergone significant population declines and the species is now apparently extinct in many former range states. In most others, recent records are rare (e.g., there have been very few records in the Eastern Atlantic in the last decade). In the Western Atlantic, current records indicate that Largetooth Sawfish can only be regularly encountered today in the Amazon River basin, the Rio Colorado-Rio San Juan area in Nicaragua, and possibly some remote areas of French Guiana, Suriname, and Guyana. In the Indo-West Pacific, northern Australia represents a globally important remaining population centre. Overall, a population reduction based on a reduction in extent of occurrence (EOO) of ‚â•80% over a period of three generations (i.e., 1960s to present) is inferred. Despite protection in some range states (e.g., Australia, India, Brazil, United States, Mexico; it is possibly extinct in the latter two range states), threats are ongoing and the species is assessed globally as Critically Endangered. ","Available life history information on Largetooth Sawfish comes from in Lake Nicaragua in Central America (Thorson 1976; 1982) and from northern Australia.Largetooth Sawfish are generally restricted to shallow (&lt;10 m) coastal, estuarine, and fresh waters, although they have been found at depths of up to 26 m in Lake Nicaragua. Largetooth Sawfish move across salinity gradients freely and in northern Australia, parturition probably occurs in brackish or saltwater and juveniles spend ~4‚Äì5 years in the freshwater reaches of rivers and floodplain waterholes before migrating to estuarine and marine waters (Thorburn et al. 2007, Peverell 2008, Whitty et al. 2008, Whitty et al. 2009, P. Kyne unpublished data). In Lake Nicaragua, individuals spent much, if not all, of their lives in freshwater with reproduction of the population occurring primarily in the lake (Thorson 1982).The life history of Largetooth Sawfish, like many elasmobranchs, is characterised by slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity, which generally contributes to a low intrinsic rate of increase. The maximum reported size of Largetooth Sawfish is 656 cm TL, although it has been estimated up to 700 cm TL (Compagno and Last 1999). Very large individuals are now rarely seen anywhere in the Indo-West Pacific.The reproductive method of sawfishes is most likely lecithotrophic viviparity. The only known reproductive study of Largetooth Sawfish was from Lake Nicaragua in the 1970s (Thorson 1976) with other observations from northern Australia. Thorson (1976) found that both ovaries appeared to be functional, though the left seemed to be larger and carry more ova. Litter sizes in Lake Nicaragua were 1‚Äì13 (mean 7.3) following a gestation period of about five months. While the reproductive cycle is possibly biennial in the Western Atlantic (Thorson 1976), it appears to be annual in northern Australia (Peverell 2008).Size at birth ranges 72‚Äì90 cm TL (Peverell 2008). Size at maturity is ~300 cm TL for females and ~280‚Äì300 cm TL for males (Thorburn et al. 2007, Peverell 2008, Whitty et al. 2008). Age at maturity in Queensland, northern Australia, has been estimated at 8‚Äì10 years (Peverell 2008). Peverell (2008) using a preliminary vertebral growth ring analysis estimated a maximum age of 35 years in northern Australia.Using life history information from populations in Central America, Simpfendorfer (2000) estimated an intrinsic rate of increase of 0.05 to 0.07 per year and population doubling times of 10.3‚Äì13.6 years. These rates were estimated under ideal conditions (i.e. no fisheries, no population fragmentation, no habitat modification and no inbreeding depression). Moreno Iturria (2012) estimated an intrinsic rate of population increase of 0.12 yr-1, a population doubling time of 5.8 yrs and a generation time of 14.6 yrs for Indo-West Pacific Largetooth Sawfish, and an intrinsic rate of population increase of 0.03 yr-1, a population doubling time of 23.3 yrs and a generation time of 17.2 yrs for Western Atlantic Largetooth Sawfish.","The principal threats to this species are from fishing; it was formerly targeted, but is now mostly taken incidentally in broad-spectrum fisheries (CITES 2007). The long toothed rostrums of sawfishes make them extraordinarily vulnerable to entanglement in any sort of net gear, gillnetting and trawling in particular. The exploitation of elasmobranchs is high in many parts of the Largetooth Sawfish‚Äôs range, particularly in coastal areas and freshwater systems. Unregulated and unmanaged fisheries, and habitat loss and degradation all threaten sawfishes across large parts of its range.For at least part of its life cycle, the Largetooth Sawfish relies on a variety of specific habitat types including freshwater systems, estuaries and mangroves; these are all affected by human development (CITES 2007). Agricultural and urban development, commercial activities, dredge-and-fill operations, boating, erosion, and diversions of freshwater runoff as a result of continued coastal and catchment development has caused substantial loss or modification of these habitats (CITES 2007). Mining activities, in northern Australia, New Guinea (e.g., the Fly River) and elsewhere, pose a risk to Largetooth Sawfish through freshwater habitat alteration or potential pollution events. Alterations to river courses are a realised threat to Largetooth Sawfish which migrate upstream in early life stages. These range from smaller barrages and road crossing in northern Australia to large-scale river alterations in Southeast Asia.In West Africa, shark fishing increased significantly in the past several decades and ‚Äòthe intensive exploitation of sharks over the past thirty years has completely decimated the most vulnerable populations‚Ä¶‚Äô (Diop and Dossa 2011). The disappearance of sawfish in the region was thought to have begun in the 1970s when new fishers entered the region and new fishing gear was developed (Diop and Dossa 2011). Threats are ongoing in the region and given that many areas still have artisanal gillnet fisheries with little or no regulation, it is likely the population will continue to decline.In the Western Atlantic, the main threats are region-wide gillnets used effectively in rivers, at river mouths, estuaries and nearshore waters (up to 200 km out in case of Amazon-Orinoco estuaries; P. Almeida pers. comm. 2012), and trawling. In the Eastern Pacific, Largetooth Sawfish were caught by gillnets, longlines and trawl nets.In Australia, datasets indicate that net fisheries account for the greatest bycatch of sawfish (all species) across northern Australia (80.2%) followed by trawling (16.6%), line fishing (9.2%) and recreational fishing (0.3%) (Stevens et al. 2005). Largetooth Sawfish are captured by all these fishing activities (Giles et al. 2004) and declines in Largetooth Sawfish are suspected based on potential levels of exploitation (Larson et al. 2006). A survey across northern Australia from Western Australia to Queensland appears to support the assertion that fishing is responsible for declines, as it found greater numbers of sawfish in areas of lower fishing pressure (both commercial and recreational) (Thorburn et al. 2003). The sustainability of Largetooth Sawfish populations in northern Australia is considered to be at high risk due to the cumulative effects of all fisheries, and the species‚Äô low biological productivity and susceptibility to gillnets (Salini et al. 2007).A number of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australian inshore net fisheries continue to catch Largetooth Sawfish incidentally. Despite requirements to release these, there is no doubt a continuing level of bycatch-associated mortality.The extent to which recreational fishers interact with Largetooth Sawfish across northern Australia is unknown, but in some areas where the species has been recorded, recreational fishing is a popular activity, which is increasing in popularity and could pose a threat to the species. In the Fitzroy River (WA), recreational fishers have been reported killing incidentally caught Largetooth Sawfish for the ‚Äòtrophy‚Äô rostrum and for retrieval of fishing tackle (Thorburn et al. 2003).Sawfish (non species-specific records) have been recorded in derelict fishing nets in northern Australian waters; the Gulf of Carpentaria is a particular hotspot for these ‚Äòghost nets‚Äô (Gunn et al. 2010) and capture in these may result in sawfish mortality. Because of their toothed rostrum, sawfish may be exceptionally susceptible to entanglement in other types of marine debris, and entanglement has been reported in a number of types of marine debris (Seitz and Poulakis 2006). Entanglement in discarded or lost recreational fishing line may occur on occasion, as has been documented for Largetooth Sawfish in Western Australia (Thorburn et al. 2004).","Western AtlanticThe population size of this species in the Western Atlantic remains unknown. There are no data or information on trends in abundance, thus the population status is inferred from reports of capture records. Its abundance has been continuously declining over the past few decades to the point that it can now be considered rare or even extirpated in some areas where it was previously considered a common species. Burgess et al. (2009) reported on recent records of Largetooth Sawfish in the Western Atlantic. Over the last 10 years, records have only been consistently found in Brazil (Burgess et al. 2009). Records of fishermen still catching sawfish in Panama, Nicaragua, Honduras and Belize have been reported but are scarce (R. Graham pers. comm. 2012). While the species is protected in some areas, illegal fishing and bycatch landings continue to occur which indicates the population still may be in decline except in the most remote areas.Eastern AtlanticThe population size of this species in the Eastern Atlantic remains unknown. There are no data or information on trends in abundance, thus the population status is inferred from reports of capture records. Its abundance has been continuously declining over the past few decades to the point that it can now be considered rare or even extirpated in some areas where it was previously considered a common species. While records of the species still exist (Burgess et al. 2009), in many areas, the time between records is long indicating the population is still declining. Historic records of Largetooth Sawfish include most countries from Angola to Mauritania (Faria 2007, Burgess et al. 2009). However, there have been only two countries with confirmed records for the region in the last 10 years (three animals in Guinea-Bissau in 2003, 2004 and 2005; one animal in Sierra Leonne in 2003). There are unconfirmed records (Pristis sp.) from two countries (three animals in Guinea-Bissau in 2011, and one animal in Mauritania 2010). It is likely that areas around Guinea-Bissau represent the last areas where sawfish can be found in West Africa (Mika Diop pers. comm. 2012). Given many areas still have artisanal gillnet fisheries with little or no regulation, it is likely the population will continue to decline.Eastern PacificThe population size of this species in the Eastern Pacific remains unknown. There are no data or information on trends in abundance, thus the population status is inferred from reports of capture records. While historically found from Peru to Mexico, the only recent records (within the last 10 years) are from Columbia, Nicaragua, and Panama (R. Graham pers. comm. 2012). Costa Rica‚Äôs Osa Peninsula, which encompasses the Corcovado National Park‚Äôs Rio Sirena and the T√©rraba-Sierpe Wetland are thought to host a remnant population of sawfish, based on fisher interviews of recent but unconfirmed sightings (I. Zanella pers. comm. 2011). However, in the contiguous Golfo Dulce (Costa Rica), artisanal hook and line and net fishers interviewed in 2004 reported that they had not seen a sawfish in decades (R.T. Graham pers. comm. 2012).Largetooth Sawfish existed in Panama‚Äôs Pacific-draining man-made Lake Bayano in 1982 (Montoya and Thorson 1982), but there are no recent records from that site or other parts of Panama or nearby Colombia, based on an IUCN Shark Specialist Group (SSG) survey of members and researchers sent out by the SSG in 2011‚Äì2012. The species may now possibly be extinct in several countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador and Peru; there are no confirmed records in many parts of the region for the past decade. This represents a significant contraction in the species‚Äô extent of occurrence in the Eastern Pacific. There are some poorly studied parts of the region with suitable sawfish habitat (e.g., the Darien, Panama), suggesting that surveys are required to locate any remnant populations.Given the degree of mangrove loss and the level of artisanal net fishing, it is likely that the remnant population is still in decline.Indo-West PacificThere are almost no data on population status of Largetooth Sawfish across the Indo-West Pacific; all populations are, however, probably severely depleted.Landings of Largetooth Sawfish are now extremely rare in former range states of the Western and Northern Indian Ocean. Although the St Lucia estuary system of South Africa was once an important breeding area, sawfishes (including Largetooth Sawfish) now appear to be extinct in that country. They also now appear to be absent from southern Mozambique (S. Pierce pers. comm. 2012) and while once common in the Zambezi River (Wallace 1967) no recent sightings have been documented. Madagascar, the Seychelles, Pakistan and India, amongst other Indian Ocean range states, have all seen depletions of sawfishes, including Largetooth Sawfish. Sawfish were previously common in artisanal fishing catches on the western coast of Madagascar, but are now extremely rare along that coast (Manach et al. 2011). There are no sawfish records from the Seychelles in the last decade (D. Rowat pers. comm. 2012), and a 2009 record of a Largetooth Sawfish in Gwadar, western Balochistan, Pakistan (A. Rahim pers. comm. 2012) represents a very rare event. Surveys with fishers in Raigad District (Maharashtra state) of India (where sawfishes were commonly harvested historically) indicate a drastic decline in the sawfish fishery from 1985‚Äì1990, with only occasional catches in recent years (R. Raut pers. comm. 2012).In Southeast Asia, localised depletions and extinctions of sawfishes have been reported or inferred from across the region. During some eleven years of market surveys (over 160 visits to 11 market sites) in various parts of Indonesia only two individual sawfish (both Largetooth Sawfish) were recorded which were caught in the Arafura/Banda Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 2012) and possibly came from illegal fishing in Australian waters. Demersal elasmobranchs are intensively targeted in Indonesia (Blaber et al. 2009), and this extremely low occurrence (out of some 60,000 chondrichthyans examined) is indicative of severely depleted populations in Indonesia. In fact, it is thought that sawfishes are extinct from large areas of Indonesia. Despite the presence of sawfish rostra in houses near fishing ports, local Indonesian fishermen indicate that they have not seen sawfishes for more than 20 or 30 years (W. White pers. comm. 2012). Populations in Borneo are thought to be seriously depleted (Last et al. 2010). In Sabah (Malaysian Borneo), fishers and villagers reported sawfish as abundant in the 1970s and declining sharply in the 1980s, with very limited catches since that time (Manjaji 2002). The last known record from the Kinabatangan River was in 1996 (B.M. Manjaji-Matsumoto pers. comm. 2012).Datasets from as early as 1963‚Äì1972 showed the considerable decline in batoids in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly 1979), which included the virtual disappearance of sawfish (Pauly 1988). Declines in demersal fishes in the Thai Andaman Sea were also documented (Pauly 1979) and these likely included sawfishes. In contrast, historic accounts indicated that sawfishes were ‚Äòcommon‚Äô and caught in ‚Äòconsiderable numbers‚Äô in Thailand, including in rivers (Smith 1945). Within the Cambodian Mekong system, numbers of Largetooth Sawfish have reportedly decreased considerably. Historically, they were regularly seen as far upstream as Khon√© Falls, and in other areas of the Mekong (Tonl√© Sap and Great Lake), none have been seen for ‚Äòseveral decades‚Äô (Rainboth 1996).Largetooth Sawfish were considered common in the Philippines by Herre (1953) but none were recorded in more recent surveys and it is thought that the population ‚Äòhas greatly declined in the Philippines‚Äô (Compagno et al. 2005).Largetooth Sawfish had previously been described as common in the middle reaches and large tributaries of the Fly River, Papua New Guinea (Roberts 1978) but its status there requires reappraisal. More recently, the ‚Äòdemise‚Äô of the species has been reported in Lake Sentani, West Papua as a result of the change from traditional fishing methods to the use of gill nets (Polhemus et al. 2004).All sawfish species have undergone significant, albeit largely unquantified, declines in Australia. In places, viable populations persist, representing some of the last viable populations in the Indo-West Pacific, with Australia being one of a limited number of global strongholds for sawfishes (Stevens et al. 2005, DSEWPaC 2011a). Genetic data indicate that Largetooth Sawfish has moderate levels of genetic diversity and male-biased dispersal in Australian waters (Phillips et al. 2011, Phillips 2012). Genetic evidence suggests that females have strong reproductive philopatry (returning to sites previously used for reproduction), with maternal population structuring between Western Australia and the Gulf of Carpentaria, with the northern coast of the Northern Territory and the Queensland east coast populations also potentially forming distinct maternal populations (Phillips et al. 2011). In contrast, males disperse between at least Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Gulf of Carpentaria (Phillips 2012).Species-specific data to accurately ascertain the status of Australian sawfishes is generally lacking and the evidence for decline and range contraction is largely anecdotal. Data from the Queensland Shark Control Program, which operates ‚Äòbather protection‚Äô fishing gear along the Queensland east coast, shows a clear decline in sawfish catch (non species-specific) over a 30 year period from the 1960s and the complete disappearance of sawfish in southern Queensland (Stevens et al. 2005). All Pristis species are now extremely rare along the Australian east coast (the area in which human population and habitat modification is greatest) where they have undergone a considerable range contraction. Although populations across northern Australia have undergone significant reduction and their status is uncertain, Australian populations are considered some of the highest in the world.While specific management measures are now in place in Australia, including full species protection, education of fishers about safe release practices, and fishery-specific management, threats are ongoing and there is no information to suggest that the population is recovering from previous declines.Across the Indo-West Pacific, a population reduction of ‚â•80% is inferred based on a reduction in extent of occurrence (EOO) over a period of three generations (i.e., 1969 to present). Declines and continuing threats (much of the species‚Äô Indo-West Pacific range, with the exception of northern Australia, is subject to intense human pressure, particularly through generally unregulated and unmanaged fisheries, and habitat loss and degradation in critical sawfish habitats) are resulting in the continual declines of remnant populations. The Australian population of Largetooth Sawfish likely comprises a high proportion of the global population (Stevens et al. 2005).",Decreasing,"The Largetooth Sawfish (Pristis pristis) comprises four distinct subpopulations: Eastern Atlantic, Western Atlantic, Eastern Pacific and Indo-West Pacific.Eastern AtlanticThe current distribution of Largetooth Sawfish in the Eastern Atlantic is uncertain due to species identification issues, lack of reporting, and the general contraction of its range. Largetooth Sawfish were historically found along the coast of West Africa from Angola to Mauritania (Faria et al. 2013). Historic records indicate that Largetooth Sawfish were once relatively common in the coastal estuaries of West Africa. Verified records exist from Senegal (1841‚Äì1902), Gambia (1885‚Äì1909), Guinea-Bissau (1912), Republic of Guinea (1965), Sierra Leone (date unknown), Liberia (1927), C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire (1881‚Äì1923), Congo (1951‚Äì1958), Democratic Republic of the Congo (1951‚Äì1959), and Angola (1951) (Burgess et al. 2009). Most records, however, lack data and locality and may have been confused taxonomically with other species. Unpublished notes from a 1950‚Äôs survey detail 12 Largetooth Sawfish from Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, and Nigeria. The presence of sawfishes in the Mediterranean Sea is still uncertain (Whitehead et al. 1984, Bilecenoƒülu and Ta≈ükavak 1999). There have been only two countries with confirmed records for the region in the last 10 years (Guinea-Bissau in 2003, 2004 and 2005; Sierra Leonne in 2003) and unconfirmed records (Pristis sp.) from one other country (Mauritania in 2010). It is likely that areas around Guinea-Bissau represent the last areas where sawfish can be found in West Africa (Mika Diop pers. comm. 2012).Although Largetooth Sawfish were included in historic faunal lists (Serena 2005), it is still debatable whether sawfishes occurred as part of the Mediterranean ichthyofauna or as a vagrant species as seasonal migrants from areas off West Africa.Western AtlanticIn the Western Atlantic, Largetooth Sawfish were widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical marine and estuarine waters. Largetooth Sawfish were found from Uruguay through the Caribbean and Central America, the Gulf of Mexico, and seasonally to the United States (Burgess et al. 2009, Faria et al. 2013). Currently, Largetooth Sawfish are thought to primarily occur in freshwater habitats in Central and South America. Largetooth Sawfish have been recorded in locations at least 1,340 km from the ocean in the Amazon River, as well as in Lake Nicaragua and the San Juan River and other east coast Nicaraguan rivers. The species has also been reported in coastal systems in Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana and Columbia in South America. In Central America, scattered reports still exist for Largetooth Sawfish in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Belize. In Mexico, the lack of records may indicate the species is no longer found west of the Yucatan Peninsula (R. Graham pers. comm. 2012). Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the species presence was historically uncertain and early records may have been Smalltooth Sawfish (P. pectinata). Though historically reported in the United States, it appears that Largetooth Sawfish were never abundant and was likely a season migrant. The species has not been reported in the United States since the 1960s (Burgess et al. 2009).Eastern PacificIn the Eastern Pacific, the historic range of Largetooth Sawfish was limited by the cooler water currents to the north of its range (California current) and the Humboldt Current in the south (V. Faria pers. comm. 2012). The historic range is thought to occur from Mazatl√°n, Mexico to Peru (Chirichigno and Cornejo 2001, Cook et al. 2005, Faria et al. 2013). Other references (i.e., Amezcua-Linares 2009) suggest that it occurred south from Topolobampo (some 440 km further north than Mazatl√°n), highlighting the uncertainty over its historic range. The occurrence of Largetooth Sawfish in Peru may have represented seasonal migration from the species‚Äô core range in Central America. Largetooth Sawfish were historically reported from a number of freshwater systems in the Eastern Pacific (as summarised by Cook et al. 2005).Indo-West PacificThe Indo-West Pacific subpopulation of the Largetooth Sawfish was formerly wide-ranging from parts of the Western Indian Ocean through India, the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia to New Guinea and northern Australia. Its current distribution is now patchy across its range. It had been confirmed from several major river systems of Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Malaysia (including Borneo), Cambodia, Viet Nam and the Philippines (Roberts 1978, Tan and Lim 1998, Compagno et al. 2005, Stevens et al. 2005). Its occurrence in many of these is now uncertain or non-existent. It may now be extinct in several range states, including South Africa, the Seychelles, Thailand and others; elsewhere it has been severely depleted.Northern Australia may be the last viable population stronghold in the Indo-West Pacific, although it may persist in remote parts of the region. It occurs across tropical northern Australia from the northeastern coast of Queensland, across Cape York, the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region (Western Australia). It has occurred as a vagrant to southwestern Australia (Last and Stevens 2009).","While international trade sawfishes is banned under the species‚Äô listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), illegal international trade may still exist due to the high value of their products.The exploitation of elasmobranchs is high in many parts of the Largetooth Sawfish‚Äôs global range, and there is no doubt that it is still caught, landed and traded.McDavitt (2005) reviewed all available information related to sawfish trade and identified six sawfish parts, derived mostly from sawfish captured as bycatch in fisheries, which were historically or currently found in trade. These sawfish parts identified in trade are: fins, whole rostra, rostral teeth, meat, organs and skin.The fins of sawfish are used to produce shark fin soup and sawfish fins are highly favored in Asian markets (NMFS 2009). Because of their large fins with high fin needle content, fins of species in the family Pristidae are highly valued for shark fin soup (CITES 2007).Sawfish rostra are often traded as curios, ceremonial weapons, or for use in traditional medicines (NMFS 2009). Rostra have long been a favorite marine curio (Migdalski 1981), with large rostra commanding impressive prices (McDavitt 1996). Organized curio trade in rostra of species in the family Pristidae has recently been reported in Brazil (Charvet-Almeida 2002, McDavitt and Charvet-Almeida 2004). It was estimated that 90‚Äì180 large rostra are purchased annually by Asian buyers from the main fish market in northern Brazil, presumably for the curio trade (McDavitt and Charvet-Almeida 2004). Local artisans in Brazil sometimes decorate medium-sized pristid rostra (usually Largetooth Sawfish) for sale to tourists. Overall, an estimated 1,000‚Äì1,500 small- to medium-sized rostra are sold per year from this same market for a variety of purposes (McDavitt and Charvet-Almeida 2004). The use of rostra in traditional medicine includes some use in Mexico and Brazil (NMFS 2009).Rostral teeth of species in the family Pristidae have been the preferred material used to manufacture artificial spurs on Peruvian fighting cocks (Cogorno Ventura 2001). The rostral teeth are mostly obtained from Brazil, Ecuador, Panama and various Caribbean countries (CITES 2007). Charvet-Almeida (2002) and McDavitt and Charvet-Almeida (2004) determined that rostra find their way into the international cockfighting market from Brazil.Sawfish are regularly used for their meat; however, most of the consumption is local and so they appear to be only occasionally traded beyond local markets (NMFS 2009). In the north of Brazil, Charvet-Almeida (2002) reported a limited market for meat, rostra and rostral teeth of fish in the family Pristidae.Chinese traditional medicine also uses other sawfish parts, including liver, ova and gall bladder (NMFS 2009).Sawfish skin has been used to produce leather, which, like shark leather, is considered of very high quality (NMFS 2009). The leather is used to make belts, boots, purses, and even to cover books (NMFS 2009).Sawfishes are highly prized as display animals in public aquariums due to their large size, bizarre shape, and shark-like features (McDavitt 1996, NMFS 2009). Prior to the uplisting of ‚ÄòPristis microdon‚Äô to CITES Appendix I at the 16th Conference of Parties in 2013, it was listed on Appendix II (in 2007) ‚Äòfor the exclusive purpose of allowing international trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable aquaria for primarily conservation purposes‚Äô. This legal international trade in Largetooth Sawfish for aquaria originated only from Australia and involved a small number of Largetooth Sawfish. In 2011, Australia determined that it was not able to issue a Non-Detriment Finding, ruling that ‚Äòit is not possible to conclude with a reasonable level of certainty that any harvest of P. microdon for export purposes would not be detrimental to the survival or recovery of the species‚Äô (DSEWPaC 2011b). As such, there has been no export since 2011. Domestic harvest for aquariums in ongoing in Australia with juveniles periodically collected in the Northern Territory and Queensland.In the Eastern Pacific, Largetooth Sawfish were used for human consumption (meat) (McEachran 1995), or for ornamental purposes (Amezcua-Linares 2009), as well as the other uses outlined above. Sawfish have been historically highly valued for fins, meats and liver oil in the Indo-West Pacific. India has traditionally been a regional hub in the shark fin trade, collecting fins from around the Western Indian Ocean (e.g., Red Sea, Persian (Arabian) Gulf, Indian subcontinent), and shipping these to the main markets of Singapore and Hong Kong (M.T. McDavitt pers. comm. 2012). Trade in shark fin is significant throughout Southeast Asia.In northern Australia, the meat of sawfish is sometimes utilised by Indigenous communities but the extent to which Indigenous Australians harvest and utilise Largetooth Sawfish is unknown; it is likely localised and at a low rate.See CITES (2007) for a comprehensive overview of trade in sawfishes.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"All species of sawfish are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), which effectively bans commercial international trade in sawfish or their parts.Eastern AtlanticSawfish are protected in the Exclusive Economic Zone in Guinea and Senegal and in Marine Protected Areas in Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau (S.V. Fordham pers. comm. 2012).Western AtlanticLargetooth Sawfish are protected in Brazil. The commercial fishery for both shark and sawfish is banned in Lake Nicaragua and all take of Largetooth Sawfish is banned in Mexico (where it already appears to be extinct). Largetooth Sawfish are also listed as Endangered under the US Endangered Species Act.Eastern PacificAll take of Largetooth Sawfish is banned in Mexico (where it already appears to be extinct). Elsewhere throughout the Pacific range of Largetooth Sawfish, there are no conservation or management measures, and these are urgently needed.Indo-West PacificWithin Australia, Largetooth Sawfish has the following conservation and protected status listings: Australian Commonwealth waters, Vulnerable (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999); Queensland, Protected (Fisheries Act 1994); Northern Territory (NT), Vulnerable (Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000); Western Australia (WA), Totally Protected (Fish Resources Management Act 1994). The take of the species is therefore prohibited within Australian Commonwealth, state and territory waters.In addition to the above legislated regulations, the Commonwealth, Queensland, NT and WA all have fisheries management plans in place for interactions with protected species, including Largetooth Sawfish. These include mandatory reporting of interactions with these species, release of live animals, observer coverage of most of the fisheries (although this is very low in state and territory fisheries which are likely to interact with Largetooth Sawfish) and education programmes for fishers on identification and ways to minimise interactions with this species. The Queensland Government has published a guide to the safe release of sawfish for commercial fishers (DEEDI 2010) and NT shark fishers have a Code of Practice for the release of live sawfish from gillnets (Salini et al. 2007).Several spatial closures in riverine, estuarine and coastal waters in the NT Barramundi Fishery offer Largetooth Sawfish some refuge from commercial gillnet fishing activities in the NT. Closed areas within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the closure of rivers in Princess Charlotte Bay to gillnetting may also afford some protection. Seasonal spawning closures for the take of Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) (mostly during the summer wet season) throughout much of the range add a level of protection to the species, however, information on Largetooth Sawfish long-term movement patterns and habitat use are required in order to assess the benefits of closed areas and seasons not specifically designed for sawfish.In northern Australian prawn trawl fisheries, the use of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) and bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) is mandatory, though the benefit of these devices on sawfish is poorly quantified. In one study, they have been shown to reduce the catch of Narrow Sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata), however, they and other sawfish species are still being caught as their rostra become tangled in the body of the net (Brewer et al. 2006).Outside of Australia, awareness needs to be raised, and regulations put in place to protect all sawfishes and promote population recovery. While sawfishes (including Largetooth) are theoretically protected in India (Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act), threats continue with little beneficial management, although increasing awareness of sawfishes in India is encouraging. Largetooth Sawfish are also protected in Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia. Although protected in these range states, the lack of enforcement or specific fisheries regulations, and ongoing gillnet and trawl fisheries, means that the threats are ongoing.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
272,North America,Pristis pectinata,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,RHINOPRISTIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,PRISTIDAE,Pristis,pectinata,A2cd,"The Smalltooth Sawfish (Pristis pectinata) has been wholly or nearly extirpated from large areas of its former range in the Atlantic Ocean by fishing (trawl and inshore netting) and habitat modification. Negative records from scientific surveys, anecdotal fisher observations, and fish landings data over its historic range infer a population reduction of ‚â•95% over a period of three generations (i.e., 1962 to present). The remaining populations are now small, and fragmented. The species can only be reliably encountered in the Bahamas (where suitable habitat is available) and the United States (Georgia south to Louisiana). It is rare but present in Honduras, Belize, Cuba, Sierra Leone, and possibly Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania. Threats to Smalltooth Sawfish still exist today in areas where sawfish are unprotected and habitat modification (mangrove removal) and inshore netting still occurs.","Currently, life history information for the Smalltooth Sawfish is only available for the Western Atlantic and it assumed that life history parameters are similar for conspecifics throughout the Atlantic Ocean. This species is lecithotrophic viviparous and litter size is thought to be 15‚Äì20 pups (Simpfendorfer 2005) born every other year, but there are little supporting data for this. Demographic analysis using early reports of life history and estimates from other pristids indicated that Smalltooth Sawfish intrinsic rate of increase ranged from 0.08 to 0.13 yr‚àí1, and population doubling times from 5.4 to 8.5 yrs (Simpfendorfer 2000).There is still some question regarding age and size at maturity for Smalltooth Sawfish. Simpfendorfer (2005) reported maturity at 360 cm TL for females. However, females of 300‚Äì400 cm stretched total length (STL) necropsied from the US were immature, with the smallest mature female examined being 415 cm STL (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). Males were thought to be mature about 270 cm TL (Simpfendorfer 2005). However, a recently necropsied male Smalltooth Sawfish that was 308 cm TL was found to be immature (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). The smallest mature male from field-collected specimens was 371 cm STL (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). Back-transforming these lengths into ages using the von Bertalanffy growth model of Scharer et al. (2012) indicates that males mature around 7.5 years and females 10‚Äì12 years. As these data indicate much faster growth and earlier maturation than previously determined, any updated demographic model will likely indicate higher productivity and rebound potential. Moreno Iturria (2012) constructed a deterministic model based on standard life table techniques using growth estimates from Simpfendorfer et al. (2008) and calculated demographic parameters for Smalltooth Sawfish for US waters. Intrinsic rates of increase were estimated as 0.07 per year, generation time 17 years and population doubling time 9.7 years.Recent information on tag-recaptured juvenile Smalltooth Sawfish collected in Florida, USA, indicates substantially faster growth than previously assumed for this species. Simpfendorfer et al. (2008) found that growth was rapid during the first two years after birth.Using data from reported encounters from 1998 to 2008, Wiley and Simpfendorfer (2010) evaluated Smalltooth Sawfish habitat use patterns in the US. There was an inverse relationship between sawfish size and extent of northern distribution, with animals less than 200 cm having a wider latitudinal distribution and occurring farthest north, and animals greater than 200 cm reported mostly in southern Florida (Wiley and Simpfendorfer 2010). Most encounters occurred in estuarine and nearshore habitats, and their locations were not randomly distributed, having a positive association with inshore mangrove and seagrass habitats. While sawfish were reported in depths to 73 m, there was a significant relationship between size and depth, with smaller animals occurring in shallower waters (Wiley and Simpfendorfer 2010).Data from acoustic telemetry and tag-recapture information indicates Smalltooth Sawfish (less than 100 cm) had the smallest home ranges, low linearity of movement, and a preference for very shallow mud banks (Simpfendorfer et al. 2010). Juveniles greater than 100 cm demonstrated larger home ranges, preference for shallow mud/sand banks, and remained close to mangrove shorelines. Tide was found to be the main factor influencing movement on short time scales. Sawfish &lt;150 cm STL spend the majority of their time in water &lt;0.5 m deep, while larger juveniles spend most of their time in water 0.5‚Äì1.0 m deep. Juveniles &gt;130 cm had high levels of site fidelity for specific nursery areas for periods up to almost 3 months, but the smaller juveniles had relatively short site fidelity to specific locations (Simpfendorfer et al. 2010).Based on data from catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), Poulakis et al. (2011) found that most juvenile Smalltooth Sawfish had an affinity for water less than 1.0 m deep, water temperature over 30¬∫C, dissolved oxygen over 6 mg/L, and salinity between 18 and 30. Greater catch rates for sawfish over age one were associated with shoreline habitats with overhanging vegetation such as mangroves (Poulakis et al. 2011).Simpfendorfer et al. (2011) conducted a long-term tracking study and found mean daily activity space was 1.42 km of river distance. The distance between 30-minute centres of activity was typically 0.1 km, suggesting limited movement over short time scales. Salinity electivity analysis demonstrated an affinity for salinities between 18 and at least 24, suggesting movements are likely made in part, to remain within this range (Simpfendorfer et al. 2011).The US National Marine Fisheries Service designated critical habitat for the US distinct population segment of Smalltooth Sawfish (Norton et al. 2012). The nursery habitats essential to the conservation of the species were identified as those adjacent to red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) and euryhaline habitats with water depths less than or equal to 0.9 m (Norton et al. 2012).For adult sawfish, unpublished data from pop-off archival satellite transmitting (PAT) tags indicate Smalltooth Sawfish spend the majority of their time in shallow waters (&lt;10 m deep) and prefer temperatures between 22¬∞C and 28¬∞C (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). The maximum recorded depth for Smalltooth Sawfish is 88 m.","The principal threats to Smalltooth Sawfish are from fishing; it was formerly targeted, but is now mostly taken incidentally in broad-spectrum fisheries (CITES 2007). The long toothed rostrum of sawfish makes them extremely vulnerable to entanglement in any sort of net gear, gillnetting and trawling in particular. Depleted populations mean that commercial targeting of most stocks is no longer cost-effective and bycatch mortality is now the primary threat to Smalltooth Sawfish (CITES 2007). However, there are indications that sawfish are at times targeted opportunistically for the shark fin trade (CITES 2007). There have been some large-scale fisheries targeting the species, including in the southeastern US in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and possibly in Brazil from the 1960s to 1980s (CITES 2007).In West Africa, shark fishing increased significantly in the past several decades and ‚Äòthe intensive exploitation of sharks over the past thirty years has completely decimated the most vulnerable populations‚Ä¶‚Äô (Diop and Dossa 2011). The disappearance of sawfish in the region was thought to have begun in the 1970s when new fishers entered the region and new fishing gear was developed (Diop and Dossa 2011). Threats are ongoing in the region and given that many areas still have artisanal gillnet fisheries with little or no regulation, it is likely the population will continue to decline.Habitat degradation and loss also threaten sawfishes throughout their range (CITES 2007). The Smalltooth Sawfish relies on a variety of specific habitat types including estuaries and mangroves; these are all affected by human development (CITES 2007). Agricultural and urban development, commercial activities, dredge-and-fill operations, boating, erosion, and diversions of freshwater runoff as a result of continued coastal and catchment development has caused substantial loss or modification of these habitats (CITES 2007).","At the end of the 19th century the Smalltooth Sawfish was common in inshore waters of the western North Atlantic (e.g., Goode 1884, Henshall 1895, Jordan and Evermann 1896, Bigelow and Schroeder 1953). In the United States, the Smalltooth Sawfish population appears to have declined dramatically during the middle and later parts of the 20th century (Simpfendorfer 2002). Based on the contraction of the range and declines in landings, it is likely that the US population size is currently less than 5% of its size at the time of European settlement (Simpfendorfer 2002). However, the population of Smalltooth Sawfish may have stabilised in the United States. Based on genetic sampling, estimates of the current effective population size range of the US population of Smalltooth Sawfish were from 269.6‚Äì504.9 individuals (95% Confidence Interval 139.3‚Äì1,515) (Chapman et al. 2011).Carlson and Osborne (2012) reported the relative abundance of sawfish increased at an average rate of about 3‚Äì5% per year since 1989 based on of voluntary dockside interviews of sport fishers in the US. Despite a low population size in the US, the Smalltooth Sawfish population will probably retain &gt;90% of its current genetic diversity over the next century (Chapman et al. 2011).In the Western Atlantic, no data on population size or trends in abundance exist outside of US waters, and the only information on trends in the population can be inferred from anecdotal capture records. While early records of this species include most countries throughout Central and South America, records and reports indicate Smalltooth Sawfish can now only be reliably encountered in the Bahamas (where suitable habitat is available), Honduras, Belize, and Cuba.There are no data on population size for the Eastern Atlantic and the only information on trends in the population can be inferred from anecdotal capture records. Smalltooth Sawfish were once common in western African waters, but today records are sparse. Early records of this species include most countries from Angola to Mauritania. Specific records on length and sex of individuals come from Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau (Faria et al. 2013). However, there has been only one confirmed record for the region in the last 10 years (Sierra Leone in 2003). There are unconfirmed records (Pristis sp.) from only two other countries (Guinea-Bissau in 2011, and Mauritania 2010). It is likely that areas around Guinea-Bissau represent the last areas where sawfish can be found in western Africa (M. Diop pers. comm. 2012).",Decreasing,"In the Western Atlantic Ocean, Smalltooth Sawfish were widely distributed throughout tropical and subtropical marine and estuarine waters. Smalltooth Sawfish were found from Uruguay through the Caribbean and Central America, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic coast of the United States (Faria et al. 2013). However, Smalltooth Sawfish has been wholly or nearly extirpated from large areas of its former range. The species is currently known to occur in the southeastern United States (Simpfendorfer 2002), Bahamas (D. Grubbs pers. comm. 2012), Cuba, Honduras and Belize (R. Graham pers. comm. 2012).The current distribution of Smalltooth Sawfish in the Eastern Atlantic is uncertain due to species misidentification, lack of reporting, and the general contraction of its range. Smalltooth Sawfish was historically found along the coast of western Africa from Angola to Mauritania (Faria et al. 2013). There has been only one confirmed record for the region in the last 10 years (Sierra Leone in 2003). There are unconfirmed records (Pristis sp.) from only two other countries (Guinea-Bissau in 2011, and Mauritania 2010).The presence of sawfishes in the Mediterranean Sea is still uncertain (Whitehead et al. 1984, Bilecenoƒülu and Ta≈ükavak 1999). Although Smalltooth Sawfish were included in historic faunal lists (Serena 2005), it is still debatable whether sawfishes occurred as part of the Mediterranean ichthyofauna or are a vagrant species as seasonal migrants from areas off western Africa. Reports of Smalltooth Sawfish outside of the Atlantic Ocean are likely misidentifications of other sawfish species (Faria et al. 2013). ","While international trade in sawfishes is banned under the species‚Äô listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), illegal international trade may still exist due to the high value of their products.McDavitt (2005) reviewed all available information related to sawfish trade and identified six sawfish parts, derived mostly from sawfish captured as bycatch in fisheries, which were historically or currently found in trade. These sawfish parts identified in trade are: fins, whole rostra, rostral teeth, meat, organs and skin. It appears that the commercial trade in Smalltooth Sawfish parts from the US population is currently minimal due to their rarity. However, the demand for fins and rostrums provides a motivation to kill sawfish, a threat that will become increasingly significant as the population recovers (NMFS 2009).The fins of sawfish are used to produce shark fin soup and sawfish fins are highly favored in Asian markets (NMFS 2009). Because of their large fins with high fin needle content, fins of species in the family Pristidae are highly valued for shark fin soup (CITES 2007).Sawfish rostra are often traded as curios, ceremonial weapons, or for use in traditional medicines (NMFS 2009). Rostra have long been a favorite marine curio (Migdalski 1981), with large rostra commanding impressive prices (McDavitt 1996).Rostral teeth of species in the family Pristidae have been the preferred material used to manufacture artificial spurs on Peruvian fighting cocks (Cogorno Ventura 2001). The rostral teeth are mostly obtained from Brazil, Ecuador, Panama and various Caribbean countries (CITES 2007). In the north of Brazil, Charvet-Almeida (2002) reported a limited market for meat, rostra and rostral teeth of sawfishes.Sawfish are regularly used for their meat. However, most of the consumption is local and so they appear to be only occasionally traded beyond local markets (NMFS 2009). Sawfish meat has been utilised historically in the US; Romer (1936) reported that sawfish were the second most common elasmobranch species taken in the shark fishery in the Florida Keys during the 1930s (NMFS 2009).Sawfish liver has also been used as a source of liver oil and the fishery in the Florida Keys described by Romer (1936) used livers as a source of vitamin A (NMFS 2009). The use of livers as a source of vitamin A stopped during the 1940s when cheap synthetic forms became available (NMFS 2009). Chinese traditional medicine also uses other sawfish parts, including liver, ova and gall bladder (NMFS 2009).Sawfish skin has been used to produce leather, which, like shark leather, is considered of very high quality (NMFS 2009). The leather is used to make belts, boots, purses, and even to cover books (NMFS 2009).Species in the family Pristidae are highly prized as exhibit animals in public aquaria because of their charismatic nature (McDavitt 1996). Sawfish have been exhibited in large public aquaria for over 50 years. Their large size, bizarre shape, and shark-like features have made them popular additions to shark aquaria exhibits worldwide (NMFS 2009). Since their Endangered Species Act listing, NMFS has not granted any permits to take live Smalltooth Sawfish for public display although there has been some trade between institutions that house these sawfish, but no new specimens have been added (NMFS 2009). To meet the demand for sawfish for public display, US aquaria turned to suppliers in Australia who supplied the Largetooth Sawfish (Pristis pristis) (NMFS 2009). However, Largetooth Sawfish can no longer be exported from Australia.See CITES (2007) for a comprehensive overview of trade in sawfishes.",Marine,"All species of sawfish are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), which effectively bans commercial international trade in sawfish or their parts.National protections for Smalltooth Sawfish have been adopted in the United States. Smalltooth Sawfish were listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 2003 which makes it illegal to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect or to attempt to engage in any such conduct with Smalltooth Sawfish. ‚ÄòCritical Habitat‚Äô has also been established for juvenile Smalltooth Sawfish in the US (NMFS 2009, Norton et al. 2012), which is a key conservation objective, designed to facilitate recruitment into the adult sawfish population by protecting juvenile nursery areas.Outside US waters, Nicaragua imposed a permanent ban on targeted sawfish fishing in Lake Nicaragua. In Brazil, the Smalltooth Sawfish is protected (no take) by the Ministry of Environment and in Mexico the take of all sawfishes is banned. Sawfish are protected in the Exclusive Economic Zone in Guinea and Senegal and in Marine Protected Areas in Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau (S.V.

273,North America,Puffinus newelli,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PROCELLARIIFORMES,AVES,PROCELLARIIDAE,Puffinus,newelli,A3bce+4bce,"This species has been declining at an accelerating pace on its breeding islands, principally as a result of depredation by introduced predators, habitat deterioration and hurricanes. Therefore, it is listed as Critically Endangered.","The species breeds in steep and extremely rugged terrain at 160-1,200 m. It usually nests in burrows associated with the root structure of trees, including Ohia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) and a dominant understory of densely matted uluhe fern (Dicranopteris linearis) in montane mesic forests on steep slopes (Ainley et al. 1997, N. Holmes in litt. 2007). In general, it can nest in any habitat that is free of predators (Troy et al. 2016, D. Ainley in litt. 2016).The breeding season begins in April, when birds return to prospect for nest sites and, following an exodus in late April, egg-laying in early June is highly synchronised (NSWG 2005). Pairs produce one egg, which is incubated for an average of 53-54 days, followed by a fledging period of 81-94 days (NSWG 2005). Most young fledge by November (Mitchell et al. 2005). The age at first breeding is around six or seven years (Mitchell et al. 2005). The species's diet is not well known, although it likely consists of fish and squid,&#160;particularly flyingfish and Purpleback Flying Squid (Mitchell et al. 2005, Ainley et al. 2014). It forages for hundreds of kilometres offshore, often in large, mixed species flocks associated with schools of large, predatory fish that drive prey species to the ocean surface (Mitchell et al. 2005, NSWG 2005). ","The main threat to this species is thought to be predation by non-native species (D. Ainley in litt. 1999, Mitchell et al. 2005, NSWG 2005). Predation of adults and juveniles by feral cats Felis catus and Barn Owls Tyto alba has been documented on almost every colony on Kaua'i, including the most remote sites (NSWG 2005, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans, Black Rats R. rattus, Brown Rats R. rattus and House Mice Mus musculus were inadvertently introduced to the Hawaiian islands as a result of human activity and shipwrecks (Duffy 2010) and may depredate eggs and chicks (NSWG 2005). Brown Rats appear to be more associated with human settlement and do not appear to be as severe a threat as the other two introduced rat species (Raine et al. 2017). Another potential predator, the Small Indian Mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, has recently been discovered on Kaua'i (NSWG 2005), and could potentially be a greater threat than cats as its smaller size means it may be able to enter breeding burrows more easily (Duffy and Capece 2014). It is yet to establish a permanent presence on the island (D. Ainley in litt. 2016), although it has a history of incursions onto Kaua'i and one was trapped there in 2016 (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). When the Two-spotted Leafhopper Sophonia rufofascia first established on the Hawaiian Islands, it led to habitat loss through feeding on the Uluhe Fern Dicranopteris linearis which provide cover for shearwater burrows (Cooper and Day 1998). The leafhopper was a cause for great concern not only for shearwaters, but also for agricultural crops and native flora; hence a biological control programme was initiated and the insect is now hard to find on Hawai'i (Coll and Wajnberg 2017). Dogs have been shot at Ka'ena Point, while attacking nestling albatrosses and shearwaters (Duffy 2010), but the scale of their impact is unknown. Habitat loss due to conversion and introduction of herbivores like domesticated goats and pigs pose another threat on the Hawaiian Islands (Reed et al. 2012), and have been suggested as a contributing factor for the recent abandonment of some colonies (Troy and Holmes 2008, N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). On Kaua'i, hurricanes Iwa and Iniki devastated the forests in 1982 and 1992, dramatically reducing available nesting habitat and reducing breeding attempts for Newell‚Äôs Shearwaters (Ainley et al. 1997, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Given that a large proportion of the population breeds on Kaua'i, catastrophic events, like hurricanes, represent a serious threat (Mitchell et al. 2005). During the 1980s and 1990s an estimated 70 adults and 280 subadults each summer, and at least 340 fledglings each autumn, died as a result of collisions with power-lines and communications towers, or indirectly because of light attraction (Podolsky et al. 1998, Anon. 2007). In the surveyed areas on eastern and southern Kaua'i, 350 adults are reported dead each year from collisions with power lines (Podolsky et al. 1998). Fledglings on their first flight to the ocean are particularly susceptible to attraction to artificial light. The birds are attracted and disoriented by coastal street lights and once grounded, unable to fly and often killed by cars, cats or dogs, or die from starvation or dehydration (Mitchell et al. 2005). Between 1978 and 1981, more than 5,000 individuals were grounded on Kaua'i, and more than 30,000 have been found as victims of fallout since 1971 (Anon. 2007, Griesemer and Holmes 2011). Intense rescue programmes have been initiated to find grounded birds and return them to the sea (Everett and Pitman 1993). On Kaua'i, approximately 1,500 fledglings are recovered annually after becoming grounded (Mitchell et al. 2005), although with the suspected steep population decline on Kaua'i, the number of grounded birds is expected to have decreased proportionately (D. Ainley in litt. 2016). Collision with artificial structures (such as powerlines and wind turbines) is another key threat to the species, particularly in flight corridors for subadult and adult birds accessing inland colonies. Nine communications towers have recently been constructed on the Hawaiian Islands without proper consultation, and these are now the subject of an ongoing lawsuit (Anon. 2007). A field of wind generators was planned for Kaua'i and Lana'i (Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 2009 in Duffy 2010), without accounting for the potential impacts on this species. Although wind farms have been shown to have only minor effects on other bird species elsewhere, night-flying Shearwaters may be particularly vulnerable and the cumulative effects of construction and maintenance, erosion, vegetation clearing and noise should be accounted for (Duffy 2010). It is not confirmed whether the wind farm projects will be realised (T. Holmes in litt. 2007, A. Raine in litt. 2016). Plastic pollution poses yet another threat. On Kaua'i, 50% of Newell‚Äôs Shearwater fledglings necropsied during 2007‚Äì2014 contained plastic items in their digestive tract and there is evidence that the mass and the number of items ingested per bird have also increased since the 1980s (Kain et al. 2016). It is thought that consumption of even small quantities of plastic, including fibres and small fragments, exposes birds at all stages of the breeding cycle to plastic-associated co-pollutants and associated impacts survival (Kain et al. 2016). On Hawai'i, cinder mining has resulted in habitat loss at several colonies (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1983 in Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997, Mitchell et al. 2005) and together with other causes of habitat degradation (invasive vegetation, agriculture and urbanisation) contributes to the exposure and increased predation of ground-nesting birds (Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997). The species is also likely to be impacted by the commercial fishery through bycatch and indirect ecosystem effects resulting from overfishing of tuna Tunnus spp. (Mitchell et al. 2005, Waugh et al. 2012).","There have been several population size estimates for this species (see Griesemer and Holmes 2011), but the most recent gives a minimum population estimate of 27,011 individuals (Joyce 2016), which roughly equates to 18,000 mature individuals. However, given the decline on Kauai and near extirpation from Maui, the population size could now be far smaller (D. Ainley in litt. 2016). The population size is therefore precautionarily placed in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Puffinus newelli nests principally on the mountains of Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.). Small colonies exist on Moloka'i, Hawai`i and possibly Maui, with unconfirmed records from Lana`i. After not having been recorded on Oahu since the 1700s, a survey carried out in 2016-2017 located the species in two sites at Mount Kaala and at Poamoho, suggesting that it regularly visits or even breeds on the island (Young et al. 2019). ",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIn the late 1970s, a cross-fostering experiment was carried out at Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge (Kaua'i), in which 90 eggs were placed in nests of the Wedge-tailed Shearwater (Ardenna pacifica) (Anon. 2007). Subsequently, 30 young were fledged. Four breeding pairs nesting in 2006 were believed to be descendents of fostered birds (Anon. 2007). Between 2006 and 2013, colony calls were played at the Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge and artificial burrows constructed to attract nesting pairs, as there is a low threat from alien predators or collisions with artificial structures (Anon. 2007). Subsequently, up to 13 pairs have been recorded there (N. Holmes and A. Raine&#160;in litt. 2016). After the construction of a predator-proof fence in 2015 within the Refuge, 8 chicks were translocated to the site from montane colonies and were raised to fledging (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). It is planned to translocate up to 50 chicks to the Refuge over a five year period (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). Also since 2015, social attraction has also been employed in an attempt to save the population on Maui. While the results are looking favourable, it is too soon to evaluate success (D. Ainley in litt. 2016).In total, predator control and monitoring activities are in place at six colonies on Kaua'i, which involve the control of cats, rats, pigs and Barn Owls as well as monitoring the effectiveness of these activities through the use of cameras and acoustic monitoring devices (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). On Kauai', Barn Owl control is also carried out at another five colonies located along the Na Pali coast, Kalaheo/Kahili and Hanalei valley (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). The effectiveness of Barn Owl control is being monitored through the deployment of acoustic recording devices via helicopter in management areas (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016).There is an active programme to control lights across Kaua'i. Building's lighting has been effectively re-designed to reduce collisions (Ainley et al. 1997). A ruling brought by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006 under the U.S. Endangered Species Act has enforced a campaign, in which all non-essential lights on Kaua`i are required to be turned off or shielded between 15 September and 15 December when young birds leave their nests (Appel 2006). In the course of the campaign, also street lights are darkened or turned off by the island's electricity company.&#160;Moreover, the electricity company of Kaua'i has started incorporating a range of measures to reduce powerline collisions, including moving lines underground, lowering them, fitting diverters and testing a ‚Äòlaser fence‚Äô on key lines to make them more visible to birds moving at night (Griesmer and Holmes 2011, N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). Several lawsuits have already been brought forward for violations under the Endangered Species Act (Harrison 2009), including against a hotel which was responsible for over one quarter of all birds downed as a result of light pollution. However, there is still a considerable amount of infrastructure that needs to be modified. It is not expected that the threat posed by artificial lighting will ever be completely eliminated (N. Holmes in litt. 2007). Yet overall, significant improvements have been made to reduce light attraction and collision (N. Holmes in litt. 2007). Over 30,000 downed birds have been rescued and released through the Save Our Shearwaters programme since 1979 (Raine et al. 2017), although few of these birds have subsequently been found again (NSWG 2005, D. Ainley in litt. 2016). Conservation Actions ProposedEnforce regulatory compliance to minimize light attraction (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016).&#160;Continue predator control in remaining populations in north-west Kaua'i (Ainley et al. 1997, N. Holmes in litt. 2007, N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). Establish predator-free colonies through fencing, trapping of predators, and use social attraction to entice shearwaters to nest within (Griesemer and Holmes 2011, D. Ainley in litt. 2016). Continue to use radar observations to monitor population trends and develop methods to monitor breeding success (Mitchell et al. 2005, NSWG 2005). Conduct long-term demographic studies to measure the success of habitat and predator management (Mitchell et al. 2005). Continue to retrieve grounded birds (N. Holmes in litt. 2007). Evaluate the survival rates of released birds and test alternative rehabilitation practices (NSWG 2005).&#160;Continue to search for additional breeding areas and carry out further research into foraging range and feeding behaviour (Mitchell et al. 2005, NSWG 2005). Initiate studies into the potential effects of the tuna fishery on the species's populations, perhaps by modelling interactions (Mitchell et al. 2005, NSWG 2005).",Nearctic|Oceanian,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with approximately 71.2% of nesting for the species occurring on a single, 30.4 km stretch of nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico. The Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd based on an observed population size reduction of more than 80% (estimated reduction = 82.6‚Äì88.3%) over the past three generations (Bevan et al. 2016), whose causes are known and reversible, (e.g. egg collection for human consumption), but some of which have not yet ceased (e.g. incidental capture in fisheries, pollution).JustificationThe Kemp's Ridley population qualifies for Critically Endangered under criterion A2bd due to a long-term reduction in population size that exceeds 80% (82.6‚Äì88.3%) the causes of which are known but have not ceased. This reduction in nesting is based on comprehensive nesting data since 1978 and on estimates of historic population size based on the 1947 Herrera film (Hildebrand, 1963, Bevan et al. 2016) (see Figure 2 in Supplementary Information). The availability of long-term nest counts (as an index of population abundance), and their comparison to historic population estimates by Hildebrand (1963), documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic and current nesting data&#160;(Bevan&#160;et al. 2016), indicate that the current population represents a greater than 80% reduction in historic population size (i.e. 82.6‚Äì88.3% reduction). &#160;By comparing abundance trends from recent years with an independent quantification of the estimated number of turtles in the 1947 arribada filmed by Andres Herrera (i.e. estimate of 26,916 turtles in a single arribada, one of several that occur annually) and a previous estimate of total nesting abundance in that arribada (40,000 turtles; Hildebrand [1963]) facilitated updated estimates of total nest abundance in 1947. Using this approach, Bevan et al. (2016) estimated between 121,517 and 180,587 nests during the 1947 nesting season. In contrast, the maximum annual abundance of nests over the past several decades was 25,654 in 2017, and has averaged 21,156 from 2016 to 2018 (see Figure 2&#160;in Supplementary Information). Causes for this recent deviation from exponential recovery are unknown at present, but possibly include factors such as fisheries bycatch, impact of the 2010 'Deepwater Horizon' oil spill (DWH NRDA Trustees 2016; Gallaway et al. 2016a, b; McDonald et al. 2017; Wallace et al. 2017; Mitchelmore et al. 2017), and current carrying capacity of the GoM&#160; (Caillouet et al. 2018).The causes for the decline from 1947‚Äì1985, ranging from an estimate of 99.4% to 99.6% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan et al. 2016) were clearly understood (e.g. incidental capture by fisheries, egg harvesting, and natural predation at the nesting beach), and were reversible. The population exhibited an exponential increase from approximately mid 1990s to 2009 due to reduction of egg harvest on key nesting beaches as well as implementation of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in trawl gear operating in the Gulf of Mexico (NMFS et al. 2011). It is unknown whether or not the recent deviation from exponential recovery is temporary, and if the recovery of the Kemp's Ridley will regain its exponential recovery rate that was present prior to 2010.In summary, the current population represents &lt;20% (Bevan et al.&#160;2016) of the historic population, or a &gt;80% decline in abundance, and though causes for this decline are understood, they have not yet ceased. For these reasons, the Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd.Criterion A: Critically EndangeredRationale: An observed population size reduction of ‚â•80% (estimate ranging from to 88.3% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan et al.&#160;2016) to 82.6% (Bevan et al.&#160;2016)) over three generations based on b) an index of abundance appropriate for the Kemp's Ridley (i.e. total number of nests per season), and d) actual or potential levels of exploitation. Primary factors contributing to the decline included 1) harvesting of eggs on the nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963; Adams, 1966), 2) incidental capture by fisheries (NMFS et al. 2011. Magnuson et al. 1990), and 3) natural predation on the nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963, Pritchard and Marquez 1973, Marquez 1994).&#160; The observed decline is based on a comparison to historic population estimates in Hildebrand (1963), documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic and current nesting data (Bevan et al. 2016). Despite an exponential increase in abundance from the 1990s through 2009, the recent deviation from this exponential recovery rate since 2009 is currently not understood and may not be reversible. These factors are also the basis for the conclusion that the Kemp's Ridley is Critically Endangered under Criterion A2bd.Criterion B: Least ConcernAlthough the Kemp's Ridley occurs throughout the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast of USA, all Kemp‚Äôs belong to a single location (i.e. genetic stock). The Kemp's Ridley has shown a strong site fidelity over time for the primary nesting beach near Rancho Nuevo (at least since 1947 Herrera film). Approximately 71.2% of global Kemp's nesting occurs on 30.4 linear km of beach near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico and approximately 97% of the Kemp's Ridley global population‚Äôs nesting activity occurs on a 146 km stretch of beach that includes Rancho Nuevo along the western Gulf of Mexico in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Thus, the area of occupancy (AOO) is less than 500 km2. Lower levels of nesting occur in scattered areas along the coasts of Veracruz, Mexico, and Texas, US, but these beaches serve as nesting habitat for less than 3% of the population. The occurrence of a single primary nesting beach qualifies under B2a ‚ÄúSeverely fragmented or known to exist at only a single location‚Äù and it has an area of less than 500 km2 (B2). Additionally, the Kemp's Ridley has had an unexpected deviation from its exponent recovery rate, but it is unclear whether this is actually a continuing decline in population size. Therefore, this subpopulation is Least Concern under criterion B.Criterion C and D: Least ConcernPopulation of mature individuals (adult males and females) is currently estimated as 15,664 therefore, the Kemp's Ridley does not qualify for a threatened category under criteria C or D. The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (22,341) was calculated using standard IUCN protocol for sea turtle red list assessment.&#160; The calculation takes into account the average number of annual nests from 2016-2018 (n=21,156), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, a remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males (all values are reviewed in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley; NMFS et al. 2011).Criterion E: Not assessedRationale: There have been no formal PVAs conducted","The Kemp's Ridley inhabits coastal areas throughout the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of the United States (Hildebrand 1982, Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973, Marquez 1994) (Figure 1 in Supplementary Information) (see Geographic Range for detailed range/distribution). Although the primary nesting beach is located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, coastal areas throughout the GoM are important developmental and foraging habitat, as well as migratory corridors for reproductively active adults (Dobie et al. 1961; Hildebrand 1963, 1982; Ogren and McVea 1982; Marquez 1984; Hildebrand 1987; Ogren 1989; Witzell and Schmid 2005; Pritchard 2007; Shaver and Rubio 2008; Putman et al. 2013; Shaver et al. 2013,&#160;2016a, 2016b; Coleman et al. 2016, 2017). Additionally, the regular occurrence of juvenile Kemp's Ridleys in coastal areas along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. indicate that these areas also represent developmental and foraging habitats (Lazell 1980, Morreale et al. 1992, Musick and Limpus 1997). In addition to the coastal neritic habitats, the offshore (‚Äòoceanic‚Äô) waters of the GoM and Atlantic Coast of the U.S. are also habitats for hatchling, post hatchling, and juvenile Kemp's Ridleys (Witherington et al. 2012, Putman et al. 2013, McDonald et al. 2017). These areas of the GoM and Atlantic represent important developmental and foraging habitat for both oceanic and neritic life history stages of the Kemp's Ridley. &#160;&#160;For further information on Kemp's Ridley habitat use and ecology, see reviews in NMFS et al. (2011), NMFS and USFWS (2015).","As reviewed in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle (NMFS et al. 2011), and the Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle 5-year Review (NMFS and USFWS 2015), the major threats to the Kemp's Ridley vary seasonally and geographically throughout their distribution and include:1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fisheries (bottom trawls)2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fisheries (top &amp; midwater trawl, demersal gillnet, hook &amp; line commercial, hook &amp; line recreational, boat strikes)3)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fisheries (pelagic longline, demersal longline, drift &amp; sink gillnet, pot)4)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Predation5)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Cold stunning6)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Pollution, impact of marine debris7)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Climate Change8)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Illegal harvest9)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Industrial plant intake/entrainment10)&#160; Dredging11)&#160; Ecosystem alterations12)&#160; Beach vehicular traffic13)&#160; Natural catastrophes (e.g. hurricanes)14) Toxins15) Oil spills.","The global population of the Kemp's Ridley is represented by a single population with no known subpopulations (Bowen et al. 1991, Bowen and Karl 2007). This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with a single primary nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico.Population assessment methods for sea turtles have been addressed recently (Committee on Sea Turtle Population Assessment Methods 2010, Bjorndal et al.&#160;2011, Caillouet et al. 2016). A variety of metrics can provide insight on the size and dynamics within a population.&#160; In the case of the Kemp's Ridley, the number of nests produced per year by this species represents an accurate metric for estimating the size of the adult population. Further, this metric has been has been consistently recorded for several decades in the Kemp's Ridley.The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (n=22,341) was calculated using the standard IUCN&#160; protocol for sea turtle Red List assessments. The calculation takes into account the total average number of annual nests from 2016‚Äì2018 (n=21,156; see Table 1 in Supplementary Information), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, an average remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males. All values are reviewed and reported in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley (NMFS et al. 2011).",Unknown,"The Kemp's Ridley has one of the most restricted distributions of all sea turtles (Wallace et al. 2010; see range map and Figure 1 in Supplementary Information). This species is primarily distributed throughout the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of the United States (Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973; Marquez 1984, 1994; Pritchard 2007), with rare occurrences&#160; along the Atlantic coasts of Canada, Europe, as well as Bermuda, the Azores, Madeira, and the Mediterranean Sea (Carr and Caldwell 1956;&#160;Carr 1957, 1980; Mowbray and Caldwell 1958; Zwinenberg 1977; Brongersma et al. 1979; Brongersma 1982; Bolton and Martins 1990; Tom√°s et al. 2003; Marquez-M.&#160;et al. 2004; Guzman-Hernandez et al. 2007; Witt et al.&#160;2007; Tom√°s and Raga 2008;&#160;Ernst and Lovich 2009; Insacco and Spadola 2010; Caillouet et al. 2015; Shaver et al. 2015). Nesting is primarily restricted to the western Gulf of Mexico, ranging from Texas, United States, to Veracruz, Mexico, with the majority of nesting occurring on an approximate 30 km stretch of the primary nesting beach with an epicenter located near Playa de Rancho Nuevo, in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. (see Figure 1 in Supplementary Information) (Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973, Marquez 1994, Pritchard 2007, NMFS et al. 2011, Shaver et al. 2016b).",The Kemp's Ridley is a protected species throughout its distribution in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coastal waters of the U.S. There is no legal trade of this species.,Terrestrial|Marine,"Sections G.1.1. through G.3.1 of the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle (NMFS et al. 2011) provide a comprehensive review of the conservation actions that have been implemented to protect the Kemp's Ridley and facilitate its recovery.&#160; Those sections are shown below:G.1. Existing Regulatory MechanismsG.1.1.&#160; MexicoEfforts to protect nesting Kemp's Ridleys and nesting beaches in Mexico have been ongoing since the 1960s (Marquez 1994). Legal ordinances were enacted that prohibited harvest of certain marine turtle species seasonally from May to August in the Gulf of Mexico in 1973 (DOF 1973); and all marine turtle species that occurred along the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico were protected year-round in 1978 (M√°rquez et al. 1989). In 1990, take of all marine turtle species was prohibited by presidential decree (DOF 1990). Also in 1990, the Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology (SEDUE) and Secretariat of Fisheries (SEPESCA) published the ‚ÄúPrograma Nacional de Protection y Conservacion de Tortugas Marinas (Propuesta).‚Äù This document was the origin of the National Program for Protection, Conservation, Research and Management of Marine Turtles, which was implemented in 2000 and which proposed strategies and actions for the protection, conservation, and recovery of marine turtle populations that nest in Mexico. Rancho Nuevo was declared a Natural Reservation in 1977 (DOF 1977) and further protection measures were added in 1986 (DOF 1986, Marquez et al. 1989). Rancho Nuevo was declared a Sanctuary in 2002 (DOF 2002). In 2004, it was included in the listing of Wetlands of International Importance under the Convention on Wetlands (RAMSAR).In 1993, Mexico mandated the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean through the publication of the Official Mexican Norm NOM-002-PESC-1993 (DOF 1993). In 1997, the NOM was modified to require the use of hard TEDs along the Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean coasts (DOF 1997). Hard TEDs are similar to those used in the U.S., consisting of a metal grid installed in front of the codend and an escape opening either at the top or bottom of the net. These, and a number of factors are responsible for the post-1990 increase in survival rates (e.g. nest protection, TEDs, decreased shrimping effort), which have contributed to the increase in reproduction documented on the nesting beaches (TEWG 1998, Heppell et al. 2005).G.1.2.&#160; United StatesThe Kemp's Ridley has been protected under U.S. law since its listing as an endangered species on December 2, 1970. The US Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits ‚Äòtake‚Äô of species listed under its authority. Take is defined as ‚Äúharass, harm [to the species or its habitat], pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.‚Äù Exceptions to the take prohibitions may be provided under the ESA for research, experimental populations, and take incidental to otherwise legal activities as long as the take does not jeopardize the continued existence of the species or adversely modify the species‚Äô critical habitat. The ESA also calls for recovery plans, such as this one, to help guide the recovery of the species. Protection from international trade has been afforded by CITES under which the Kemp's Ridley is listed on Appendix I.G.2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Beach ProtectionG.2.1.&#160; MexicoIn 1966, Mexico sent a team of biologists that included Humberto Chavez, Martin Contreras, and, in 1967, Rene Marquez, to Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, to survey the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle population at Rancho Nuevo, and to establish a conservation effort for this diminishing population (Chavez et al. 1967). The objective of the effort in Mexico was to protect the remaining nesting females, their eggs and hatchlings from human and animal predators thus eliminating the land-based mortality from the life cycle.From 1966 to 1987, the conservation program focused on the area of Rancho Nuevo with the camp located first at Barra Calabazas and then at Barra Coma where it presently exists. In 1977, the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (FWS), Mexico‚Äôs National Park Service (NPS), the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) all joined in the conservation efforts with Mexico‚Äôs Instituo Nacional de Pesca (INP) at Rancho Nuevo (Manzella et al. 1988, Woody 1989).&#160; In 1988, the program (now a bi-national one), expanded to the south to Barra del Tordo with a camp at Playa Dos. In 1989, a third camp was established to the north at Barra Ostionales on Rancho Los Pericos. The north camp's location was changed 10 km to the north of its original location, to near the town of Tepehuajes in 1996 for logistical reasons. Also in 1996, in coordination with SEMARNAP and the Tamaulipas' State Government, a camp was established in La Pesca. Under SEMARNAP‚Äôs supervision, Gladys Porter Zoo (GPZ), Administracion‚Äô Portuaria Integral de Altamira (API Altamira) and Universidad del Noreste expanded the project to include the beaches of Tampico and Altamira. In Veracruz, El Raudal camp was installed in 1994, but was later transferred to Lechuguillas, municipality of Vega de Alatorre. In 1997, this camp was incorporated into the bi-national program.In the 2002 season, two auxiliary corrals were constructed on the Rancho Nuevo beach. One was located to the north at Barra Carrizo and the other was constructed to the south. The additional corrals were constructed to protect nests from predation, decrease the distance eggs were transported, and provide additional space to the main corral at Rancho Nuevo.Today, general monitoring and protection activities consist of daily beach patrols made by one team to search for nesting females and protect observed nests. When several females are counted in one trip, the monitoring team alerts the camps of a possible arribada event. During the arribadas, several teams patrol the beach on all-terrain vehicles, collecting biological data from females and relocating clutches to the protected corrals. The clutches are collected and transported to the corrals as soon as possible, with the necessary precautions to avoid the early embryo mortality caused by handling. Each clutch is reburied in a cavity of similar size and depth as the in situ nest and marked for monitoring throughout the incubation period.&#160; After hatchlings emerge from their nests, they are counted, collected, and released in large groups in different spots on the beach. The content of the nest is excavated after the hatchlings are released to determine hatching success.G.2.2.&#160; United StatesDuring the last 50 years, more confirmed Kemp's Ridley nests have been located at Padre Island National Sea Shore (PAIS) in south Texas than at any other location in the U.S. (Shaver and Caillouet 1998, Shaver 2005a).&#160; The first documented record of Kemp's Ridley nesting on the Texas coast was made in 1948 (Carr 1967) at what was later designated as PAIS. PAIS is considered a secondary nesting colony (Shaver 1998a, Shaver 1999). Nests have been found elsewhere in the southeastern U.S. in conjunction with reports from the public and during monitoring conducted for loggerhead nesting activity (Anonymous 1992, Marquez et al. 1996, Johnson et al. 1999, Foote and Mueller 2002, Williams et al. 2006).Since 1986, NPS staff and volunteers have conducted patrols on North Padre Island to detect and protect nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles and their eggs, determine results of the imprinting and headstarting experiment (see G.4.2. Imprinting and Headstarting), and gather biological data (Shaver 1990, 2005a).&#160; Patrols are conducted along the entire 128 km Gulf of Mexico shoreline of North Padre Island, including 104 km of PAIS and 24 km north of the PAIS north boundary and patrol effort increased over time (Shaver 2004, 2005a).&#160; From 1986‚Äì1994, the entire North Padre Island target patrol area was covered from 2‚Äì5 days each week. From 1995‚Äì1997, the entire area was covered seven days each week. Starting in 1998, the entire area was repeatedly traversed each day to increase the likelihood of observing nesting females and locating their eggs.Systematic patrol programs were developed by various entities to detect Kemp's nesting at other locations in Texas starting in 1999.&#160; NPS staff at PAIS aided with development of many of these other nesting patrol projects by providing training, technical assistance, and some equipment.FWS, Sea Turtle, Inc., and GPZ (some years) led a program of repeated daily patrols by staff, volunteers, and interns on the 11 km of Boca Chica Beach beginning in 1999 and on the northernmost 51 km of South Padre Island beginning in 2000. Additional walking patrols were conducted on the southern developed portion of South Padre Island starting in 2006. FWS staff and Texas Master Naturalists volunteers began patrols on 45 km of Matagorda Island in 2003 and later expanded this program to include more days per week, repeated daily patrols, and the entire Kemp's Ridley nesting season. Staff and volunteers with the Animal Rehabilitation Keep (ARK) and University of Texas Marine Science Institute at Port Aransas conducted a few nesting patrols on 30 km of Mustang Island during the 2004 nesting season. The program was reinstituted and expanded to encompass at least one patrol per day during most days of the nesting season in 2006 and all days of the nesting season starting in 2007. San Jose Island has been patrolled once every eighth day since the mid-1990s. In 2005, volunteers with Help Endangered Animals-Ridley Turtles (HEART) and the Sea Turtle Restoration Project conducted patrols intermittently during the nesting season along various segments of the 230 km shoreline between Sabine Pass and the Matagorda Peninsula. This effort continued, but starting in 2006 FWS led the intermittent patrols by staff and volunteers on the northern end of Matagorda Peninsula. Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston (TAMU) conducted patrols on Galveston Island starting in 2007 and on Bolivar Peninsula starting in 2008.Educational programs alerting beach users to report nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles were implemented at PAIS in the mid-1980s and later expanded coast-wide by various groups (Shaver 1990, 2004, 2005a, 2006b, 2006c; Shaver and Miller 1999). Beach user reports have been investigated, resulting in documentation of up to half of the Kemp's Ridley nests found in Texas each year through the mid-2000s. However, from 2006‚Äì2010, beach users only found 14‚Äì21% of the annual number nests documented in Texas, likely due to the more comprehensive patrol programs conducted state-wide during those years.From 1978-1999, eggs from the nests found by patrollers and beach users along the entire Texas coast were transported to the incubation facility at PAIS for protected care. After 2000, eggs from most nests located on North Padre Island and northward on the Texas coast were transferred to the facility.&#160; The first two incubation facilities at PAIS were screen-enclosed structures attached to buildings.&#160; The first was operated from 1978‚Äì1982, the second was operated from 1983-2005, and both were used to hold over 22,000 incubating eggs received from Mexico during the experimental imprinting and headstarting project from 1978-1988 (see G.4.2. Imprinting and Headstarting).&#160; A larger solid-walled building was used starting in 2006. Further information on the incubation facilities and egg care procedures can be found in Shaver (1989, 1990, 1994, 1997a, 1997b, 1998a, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2006a, 2006b) and Shaver et al. (1988). Nearly all of the turtles hatched in the incubation facility were released during the early evening, night, or morning at the northern end of PAIS, in the vicinity of the incubation facility, although a few were released elsewhere on the beach. Healthy hatchlings from all but one of the nests found in Texas were allowed to go free after release.However, hatchlings from one Texas nest were transferred to the NMFS Galveston Laboratory for headstarting, as were the majority of hatchlings that emerged from eggs that were part of the 1978‚Äì1988 experimental imprinting effort (see G.4.2. Imprinting and Headstarting).Starting in 2008, some nests found at the southern end of PAIS were incubated in a corral located at the turtle patrol base camp, near the PAIS 64-km marker. The hatchlings from these nests were released at the southern end of PAIS (D. Shaver, PAIS, pers. comm. 2009).In 2000 and 2001, eggs found on Boca Chica Beach and South Padre Island were transferred to a corral on Boca Chica Beach.&#160; In 2002, eggs found on Boca Chica Beach were transferred to a corral there and on South Padre Island were transferred to a corral there. Starting in 2003, eggs from both South Padre Island and Boca Chica Beach nests were incubated in a corral on South Padre Island.&#160; The hatchlings were released at the corral locations that they emerged from on Boca Chica Beach or South Padre Island.G.3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Marine ProtectionG.3.1.&#160; MexicoMexico has implemented several protection measures for turtles in the marine environment. Sailing and fishing within 6.44 km of the beach at Rancho Nuevo was prohibited through the 1986 amendment to the declaration of Rancho Nuevo as a National Reservation and the 2002 declaration as a Sanctuary. TEDs have been required in the shrimp fishery operating in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean since 1993.Mexican Official Standard NOM-029 (DOF 2006) prohibits the longline shark fishery from fishing in a 5 km buffer zone off the six beaches of Tamaulipas from March through June and the five beaches of Veracruz from March through August, which overlap with the nesting period of the Kemp's Ridley.&#160; The NOM also mandated removal of fish hooks from turtles captured incidentally and required longlines to be used in the marine zone, away from a coastal band of 18.53 km starting from the baseline from which the Territorial Sea is measured (DOF 2007).G.3.2. United StatesDevelopment of TEDs began in the late 1970s to reduce incidental capture of sea turtles in the shrimp fishery (Henwood et al. 1992). TEDs consist of a device that prevents the turtle from entering the codend of the net and an escape opening that allows the turtle to escape. TEDs were first required by Florida state law in 1987 to be used by large shrimp vessels operating along the east coast of Florida between 28¬∞ and 29¬∞ N. latitudes.&#160; From 1987 through 1990, their seasonal use in the shrimp fishery expanded to include all ocean waters south of the North Carolina/Virginia border all the way around to Texas. Beginning in 1992, TEDs were required in the summer flounder fishery operating in waters off North Carolina to southern Virginia; at the same time, the shrimp fishery rules were expanded to require TED use in both inshore and ocean waters during all times of the year. The National Research Council (Magnuson et al. 1990) reviewed numerous studies and data and determined that there was strong evidence that shrimp trawling was the primary cause of sea turtle mortality in the southeast United States. They estimated that shrimp trawling caused 86% of the human caused mortalities of juvenile and adult sea turtles. The consistent and correct use of TEDs has reduced mortality due to shrimp fishing and contributed to the Kemp's Ridley population increase. It is also likely that the decline in the shrimp fishing effort in the northern Gulf of Mexico since the early 1990s has reduced sea turtle mortalities from shrimp trawling (Caillouet et al. 2008, Hart and Nance, 2013, NMFS 2007a).Since 1990, corresponding with the more widespread use of TEDs in U.S. waters, the instantaneous mortality rate of neritic sea turtles (all species observed to interact with the shrimp fishery) has been reduced by 44%-50% (TEWG 2000). The range in annual mortality reduction represents the post-1990 mortality multiplier necessary to be included in the model to obtain the observed rate of the Kemp's Ridley population increase. Age-based models indicate an increase in large benthic and adult survival post-1990s (Heppell et al. 2005).In addition to the use of TEDs, time and area closures have been established to enhance shrimp catch. The Texas Legislature established the Texas Closure through the Shrimp Conservation Act of 1959. The Texas Closure was implemented to delay harvest of brown shrimp in the Texas Territorial Sea (TTS) until the shrimp reach a larger, more valuable size and to minimize waste caused by discarding smaller shrimp during Gulf harvest (Fuls 2001). The timing of the closure can be altered by Texas, but generally occurs mid-May through mid-July, which coincides with the peak Kemp's Ridley nesting period. In addition, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council Shrimp Fishery Management Plan implements a closure of the U.S. waters off Texas to complement the traditional Texas Closure. Several rules were adopted in the early 2000s by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission to reduce fishing effort on shrimp stocks and provide additional protection to sea turtles, particularly in the nearshore Gulf (Osburn et al. 2003). The most significant rule conserving Kemp's Ridleys in Texas is a seasonal shrimping closure from Corpus Christi Fish Pass to the Texas-Mexico border (177 linear km) including all of PAIS from the beach out to 5 nautical miles from December 1 to the Summer Gulf opening or July 15. Historically, 68% of the turtle strandings and less than 3% of the total Texas shrimp weight of landings occur in this area during this timeframe. However, despite TED regulations and reductions in fishing effort, significant correlations between sea turtle stranding rates and shrimp trawling intensities in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico continued to exist through at least 1993 (Caillouet et al. 1996).Other gear regulations may also protect Kemp's Ridleys. Several states, including Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Hampshire and Florida, maintain offshore areas permanently closed to trawling. The State of Georgia requires the use of NMFS-approved TEDs in all trawl fisheries operating in state waters. South Carolina uses a water-temperature trigger to ensure whelk trawling occurs only when sea turtles are less abundant.&#160; Many states (South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas) have prohibited gillnets, but there remain active fisheries in other states and in Federal waters.&#160; Several regulations have been implemented to protect sea turtles, including Kemp's Ridleys. Since 2001, gillnet restrictions have been implemented in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, and in offshore waters of the Economic Exclusive Zone to reduce sea turtle interactions.&#160; In 2002, NMFS prohibited, in certain areas and at certain times in the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, pound nets with leaders having mesh greater than or equal to 30.5 cm and leaders with stringers.The Marine Pollution Act was enacted under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and subsequent regulations by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to restrict the discharge of plastics and set the standards for other solid waste dumping into the marine environment (Shaver and Plotkin 1998). A large portion of the debris found washed ashore at the nesting beach, and presumably floating in neonatal/juvenile pelagic habitat, is garbage dumped from ships and oil platforms. Over 90% of the trash is composed of inorganic material, mainly plastic (Sarti et al. 1996).&#160; The regulations prohibit the disposal by all vessels and offshore platforms of all plastics, paper, rags, glass, metal, bottles, crockery, and similar refuse.Oil and gas exploration activities require mitigation and measures to minimize the impacts to the Kemp's Ridley nesting beaches and marine environment. Various Federal, state, and local entities have developed spill contingency plans that are updated annually. These entities formed emergency response teams to reduce potential impacts from these spills. Oil and gas exploration and development occur at PAIS. The NPS strictly regulates these activities through the use of NPS regulations, in-depth environmental assessments under the National Environmental Policy Act, consultation with resource agencies, and close coordination with the mineral owners and developers. The NPS and FWS work to make sure that the conditions under which approval of this drilling is granted protect the park's resources, especially the Kemp's Ridley turtle. Measures have been developed to protect Kemp's Ridleys, and the plans allowing for the drilling of new wells incorporate these strict measures. Patrols are conducted at PAIS to locate and move eggs for protected incubation, thereby limiting threats from oil and gas activities and natural threats to the eggs and hatchlings. Beach patrols also involve location and protection of nesting and live- stranded turtles, although beach visitors sometimes find them before patrollers arrive. Oil and gas development and exploration in other areas on the Texas coast where Kemp's Ridleys have been documented nesting are regulated by various local, state, and Federal regulations.",Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

It may have been driven extinct by diseases spread by introduced mosquitoes and habitat destruction. A set of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017) laid out methods for quantitatively estimating a species‚Äôs probability of extinction based on parameters associated with threats, in addition to records and surveys. Based on the application of these methods (Butchart et al. 2018), this species would qualify for reclassification as Critically Endangered. However, the authors recommended retaining it as&#160;Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) because the final site for the species (the Olokui natural area reserve) is only 6.6 km2, less than half of which is suitable habitat, and it has been isolated for so long that it is highly unlikely that any population has persisted.","It is a shy and retiring bird of the montane forest canopy, although in the late 1800s it was reported as ubiquitous in forests from the lowlands to the higher elevations on Moloka'i and Lana'i (Scott et al. 1986, Wakelee and Fancy 1999). Like its congeners, it is primarily frugivorous (Wakelee and Fancy 1999, K.&#160;Wakelee in litt. 1999). ","This species's drastic decline is probably attributable to the introduction of disease-carrying mosquitoes and habitat destruction. Mosquitoes were, until recently, restricted to the lowlands, but have followed the penetration of feral pigs into remote native rainforests over the last 25 years (Pratt 1994). The uplands of Moloka'i are probably too small to provide disease-free refugia. Apart from spreading the parasite Plasmodium relictum throughout the Olomao's range, pigs also modify native forests, as they carry alien weeds to new areas, whose rooting destroys the shrub layer (Pratt 1994). Habitat degradation through introduced Axis Deer Axis axis pose an additional threat (Loope and Medeiros 1995).

The nominate subspecies of Lana'i was last seen in 1933 and is now extinct. The race rutha of Moloka'i and Maui is also likely to be extinct (Clement and Hathway 2000). It had been extirpated from Maui before ornithologists arrived, but possibly survived until the mid-19th century (J.&#160;Lepson in litt. 1999). Most of the historical range on Moloka'i in Kamako'u-Pelekunu has been resurveyed and the species has probably been extirpated from that area (DOFAW and PIERC 1995, Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001); the last confirmed record from Moloka'i was in 1980 (Pyle and Pyle 2017). However, the species cannot yet be presumed to be Extinct, because the remote Oloku'i Plateau has not been resurveyed recently and could conceivably still harbour some birds. However, at the moment visits to this area are discouraged to prevent any introduction of invasive species. No more than half of the Natural Area Reserve represents suitable habitat (E.

On autumn migration (July-October), it favoured ericaceous heath, crowberries Empetrum nigrum, pastures and intertidal flats (Gill et al. 1998). Winter habitat was possibly wet pampas grasslands, intertidal and semi-desert areas (Gill et al. 1998). On return migration (March-May), it favoured burnt areas in tall grass and mixed-grass prairies, and Rocky Mountain Grasshopper Melanoplus spretus was a key food source (Gill et al. 1998). It was gregarious, with traditional autumn migration sites (Gill et al. 1998). ","Large-scale spring hunting in North America partially explains the species's potential extinction, but there was no recovery after hunting was outlawed and abandoned in c.1916 (Gill et al. 1998). The main cause is almost certainly the near total loss of prairies to agriculture, compounded by the suppression of prairie wildfires and the extinction of M. spretus (Gill et al. 1998). The widespread conversion of the pampas began after the main decline, but has hindered any possible recovery (Gill et al. 1998).

Clay in litt. 2003), southernmost Brazil and Chile south to Patagonia (Gill et al. 1998). The return migration was probably along the Pacific coast, through Central America, across the Gulf of Mexico to the Texas coast and northwards through the prairies. It probably numbered hundreds of thousands, but declined rapidly in the 1870s-1890s to become very rare in the 20th century (Gill et al. 1998, Graves 2010). The last irrefutable record was of a specimen collected in Barbados in 1963 (Roberts et al. 2010). Since then there have been no confirmed records (none from the wintering grounds in South America since 1939), only several unconfirmed reports during 1981-2006 (Gill et al. 1998, M.

By the early 2000s the total population within the reintroduction area included more than 150 animals. By 2016, the USFWS began restricting the reintroduction effort to federal public land in mainland Dare County, North Carolina (i.e., the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge and Dare County Bombing Range). This ~ 800 km¬≤ area can support no more than 20 to 30 wolves. If such a restriction is finalized wolves living outside this area probably will be afforded little or no federal protection or be captured and returned to captivity to bolster the vigour of the captive breeding programme.&#160; Hybridization with Coyotes or Red Wolf x Coyote hybrids and landowner intolerance (and subsequent human-caused mortality) are the primary threats to the species' persistence in the wild.","Very little is known about Red Wolf habitat because the species' range was severely reduced by the time scientific investigations began. Given their wide historical distribution, Red Wolves probably utilized a large suite of habitat types at one time. The last naturally occurring population utilized the coastal prairie marshes of south-west Louisiana and south-east Texas (Carley 1975; Shaw 1975). However, many agree that this environment probably does not typify preferred Red Wolf habitat. There is evidence that the species was found in highest numbers in the once extensive bottomland river forests and swamps of the south-east (Paradiso and Nowak 1971, 1972; Riley and McBride 1972). Red Wolves reintroduced into north-eastern North Carolina and their descendants have made extensive use of habitat types ranging from agricultural lands to pocosins. Pocosins are forest/wetland mosaics characterized by an overstory of loblolly and pond pine (Pinus taeda and Pinus serotina, respectively) and an understory of evergreen shrubs (Christensen et al. 1981). This suggests that Red Wolves are habitat generalists and can thrive in most settings where prey populations are adequate and persecution by humans is slight. The findings of Hahn (2002) seem to support this generalization in that low human density, wetland soil type, and distance from roads were the most important predictor of potential wolf habitat in eastern North Carolina.","Hybridization with Coyotes or Red Wolf x Coyote hybrids is the primary threat to the species' persistence in the wild (Kelly et al. 1999). While hybridization with Coyotes was a factor in the Red Wolf's initial demise in the wild, it was not detected as a problem in north-eastern North Carolina until approximately 1992 (Phillips et al. 1995). Indeed, north-eastern North Carolina was determined to be ideal for Red Wolf reintroductions because of a purported absence of Coyotes (Parker 1986). However, during the 1990s, the Coyote population apparently became well established in the area (P. Sumner pers. comm.; USFWS, unpubl.). From the start of the reintroduction project in 1987 through to about 2005, the Red Wolf population grew to more than 150 animals. Intensive management was useful at minimizing the extent of hybridization with Coyotes and Coyote/Red Wolf hybrids (Gese and Terletzky 2015, Gese et al. 2015). However, by about 2012, the reintroduction project had become notably characterized by significant conflict with landowners (primarily over Coyote management and general frustration with the USFWS‚Äôs implementation of the Red Wolf recovery programme) which led to a substantial increase in the illegal killing of Red Wolves.","Free-ranging Red Wolves exist only in a reintroduced population in eastern North Carolina, USA. The Red Wolf had been reintroduced to this area in 1987 and within 15 years it had grown to occupy federal, state, and private lands to the west of mainland Dare County. Chronic concerns over Red Wolves hybridizing with Coyotes and Red Wolf/Coyote hybrids and increasing conflict with landowners, prompted the USFWS to consider restricting the Red Wolf restoration effort to federal lands in mainland Dare County in an area that can support no more than 20-30 individuals.",Decreasing,"As recently as 1979, the Red Wolf was believed to have a historical distribution limited to the south-eastern United States (Nowak 1979). However, Nowak (1995) described the Red Wolf's historic range as extending northward into central Pennsylvania and later redefined the Red Wolf's range as extending even further north into the north-eastern USA and extreme eastern Canada (Nowak 2002). Recent genetic evidence supports a similar but even greater extension of historic range into Algonquin Provincial Park in southern Ontario, Canada (Chambers et al. 2012). Today the species is&#160;largely restricted to federal public lands of mainland Dare County, North Carolina.",,Terrestrial,"The species is not included on the CITES Appendices. The Red Wolf is listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) (United States Public Law No. 93-205; United States Code Title 16 Section 1531 et seq.). The reintroduced animals and their progeny in north-eastern North Carolina are considered members of an experimental non-essential population. This designation was promulgated under Section 10(j) of the ESA and permits the USFWS to manage the population and promote recovery in a manner that is respectful of the needs and concerns of local citizens (Parker and Phillips 1991). Hunting of Red Wolves is prohibited by the ESA. To date, federal protection of the Red Wolf has been adequate to successfully reintroduce and promote recovery of the species in North Carolina.A very active recovery programme for the Red Wolf has been in existence since the mid-1970s (USFWS 1990; Phillips et al. 2003), with some measures from as early as the mid-1960s (USFWS, unpubl.). By 1976, a captive breeding programme was established using 17 animals captured in Texas and Louisiana (Carley 1975; USFWS 1990). Of these, 14 became the founders of the current captive breeding programme. In 1977, the first pups were born in the captive programme, and by 1985, the captive population had grown to 65 individuals in six zoological facilities (Parker 1986). As of 2017 there were approximately 175 Red Wolves in captivity at 43 facilities throughout the United States and Canada (USFWS, unpubl.). The purpose of the captive population is to safeguard the genetic integrity of the species and to provide animals for reintroduction.&#160;With the species reasonably secure in captivity, the USFWS began reintroducing Red Wolves at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in north-eastern North Carolina in 1987. As of September 2002, 102 animals have been released with a minimum of 281 descendants produced in the wild since 1987. By 2005, the population had grown to include more than 150 wolves distributed across nearly 6,000 km¬≤ of private land (~ 70%) and public land (~30%). The public land included three national wildlife refuges (Alligator River NWR, Pocosin Lakes NWR, and Mattamuskeet NWR) which provided important protection to the wolves. Notably, the USFWS also estimated that over a dozen hybrid canids were also present in north-eastern North Carolina.&#160;However, by about 2012 the reintroduction project had become mired in significant conflict with landowners (primarily over Coyote management and general frustration with the USFWS‚Äôs implementation of the Red Wolf recovery programme) that led to a substantial increase in illegal killing of wolves. In response to these characterizations, starting in 2016 the USWFS began taking steps to significantly change the direction of the Red Wolf recovery programme. By 2016 and 2017, changes being cemented into action included: 1) improving the foundation of the captive breeding programme to ensure that the species did not go extinct; 2) restricting free-ranging Red Wolves to about 800 km¬≤ of federal lands in mainland Dare County, North Carolina, an area that can support no more than 20 or 30 such animals; 3) returning all Red Wolves found elsewhere in north-eastern North Carolina to captivity to assist with #1 or providing such animals with little or no federal protection; and 4) assessing potential sites throughout the south-eastern United States for future reintroduction projects. Absent successful reintroductions that result in the restoration of several hundred red wolves (at one or a few sites), recovery of the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act will not be possible.During 1991, a second reintroduction project was initiated at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee (Lucash et al. 1999). Thirty-seven Red Wolves were released from 1992 to 1998. Of these, 26 either died or were recaptured after straying onto private lands outside the Park (Henry 1998). Moreover, only five of the 32 pups known to have been born in the wild survived, but were removed from the wild during their first year (USFWS, unpubl.). Biologists suspect that disease, predation, malnutrition, and parasites contributed to the high rate of pup mortality (USFWS, unpubl.). Primarily because of the poor survival of wild-born offspring, the USFWS terminated the Tennessee restoration effort in 1998 (Henry 1998).",Nearctic,,False,False,Global,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

In the last decade, the population has been reduced by at least 90% and the species' area of occupancy, extent of occurrence, and habitat quality continue to decline. The relationship between detection rates and actual number of mature individuals is unknown, but extensive survey results indicate substantial reductions in species detection throughout the range. It is the assessor's best estimate that the number of mature individuals in the wild is between 250 and 2,500, and likely fewer than 1,000 individuals. Extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 99,284 km2. Area of occupancy (AOO) for the species is estimated at 60 km2&#160; and remaining habitat is considered severely fragmented. With limited AOO, relatively small population size, and only three known locations remaining, the species also qualifies as Endangered under criterion B and meets the criteria for Vulnerable status under criterion D.","The Powesheik Skipperling is a small chocolate brown and light orange member of the family Hesperiidae. This butterfly was once common to tall grass prairies, mixed grass prairies, and prairie fens throughout its range. Nectar sources vary throughout the range and include black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta), Prairie goledenrod (Oligoneuron album), shrubby cinquefoil (Dasiphora futicosa), pale spiked lobelia (Lobelia spicata), Indian hemp (Apocynum cannabinum), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), stiff tickseed (Coreopsis palmate), purple coneflower (Echinacea angustifolia), sticky tofieldia (Triantha glutinosa), upland white aster and self-heal (Prunella vulgaris) (USFWS 2014). Little is known about larval host plant preferences, but larvae have been observed feeding on prairie dropseed, little bluestem,&#160; big bluestem and side oats grama (USFWS 2014). Other suspected larval food sources include mat muhly (Muhlenbergia richardsonis), elliptic spikerush (Eleocharis elliptica) and sedges (USFWS 2014). Powesheik larvae hatch in the late summer and continue development through early fall, at which point they enter diapause. They overwinter as larvae and resume feeding in the spring; development continues until larvae pupate in June. Emerging in June or July, adults have a brief lifespan of one to two weeks during which they breed and lay eggs (USFWS 2014, COSEWIC 2014).","Historically, much of the Powesheik Skipperling's prairie habitat has been lost to land conversion, development, and fragmentation. While the remaining locations are in protected areas owned by their prospective township, state, province, or country, without wildfire, grazing, or other natural disturbances, vegetation succession to woody species threatens the few sites where the species remains (COSEWIC 2014). Each of the three remaining locations is also at risk of being lost to wildfire, severe weather, or other stochastic events (COSEWIC 2014). With so few locations, the loss of any one of them could be devastating to the population as a whole. The use of agricultural chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides have likely played a role in recent population declines of the species. Recent and rapid species extirpation at isolated sites and high quality sites supports the notion that recent changes in land use, adjacent to habitats, impacts populations of the species.","The Powesheik Skipperling, once considered common throughout its range, has experienced reductions in population and habitat in recent decades. A poor understanding of the relationship between the number of mature individuals detected and the total number present makes it difficult to estimate the total population size, however, daily counts and observations at survey sites throughout the range provide an index of abundance appropriate to estimating the species' population reduction. Using survey results at several sites throughout the range, a population reduction of 90-99.6% over 10 years is estimated. As of 2014, the Powesheik Skipperling was considered extant at 4% of the historically documented sites (USFWS 2014).&#160;The cause of site loss in recent years has not been identified, but habitat loss and deterioration are believed to be contributing factors at some sites. Several sites are threatened by the invasion of woody non-native species and the loss of these sites is a real possibility; a continuing decline in the number of subpopulations as a result of this continuing decline in habitat quality and AOO can be inferred. While it is difficult to estimate the species' global population size with certainty, it has been estimated to be between 250 and 2,500 mature individuals (NatureServe 2013). In summer of 2017, surveys were conducted in Michigan prairie fen sites, and Powesheik Skipperling density at peak flight was estimated; this estimate was applied to an approximation of occupied suitable habitat, and it was estimated that the total population of Powesheik Skipperling in Michigan is 231 individuals (Belitz et al. 2019).&#160;Population estimates are not available for the other two locations, but the remaining Wisconsin site and Manitoba sites likely support fewer individuals. For this reason, it is the assessor's best estimate that the total number of individuals is between 250 and 1,000 at peak flight and that it is unlikely that the total population exceeds 1,000.",Decreasing,"Much of the tall grass prairie in North America was converted to agricultural land in the mid 1800's, making it difficult to define the Powesheik Skipperling's historical range with certainty. However, historical records indicate the Powesheik Skipperling's range covered southeastern Manitoba, eastern North and South Dakota, western Minnesota, northern Indiana, and Iowa. Isolated populations in southeastern Wisconsin, southern Michigan, and northwestern Illinois were also documented. Once considered common throughout its range, the Powesheik Skipperling's range has been greatly reduced in recent decades. As of 2014, the species was known to be extant at three locations comprised of twelve sites. These twelve sites are believed to be all that remain of the 298 historically documented sites (USFWS 2014). The Powesheik population has a very restricted number of locations remaining, each of which could be lost to a severe weather event, wildfire, or habitat loss due to non-native invasive species. Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 99,284 km2. Area of Occupancy (AOO) for the species is estimated at 60 km2. It is important to note that remaining habitat patches for the species are relatively small, and the estimate may be an overestimate of the species' actual AOO. While many of the remaining sites are located in protected areas, habitat degradation continues to be a serious threat to remaining locations, therefore a continuing decline in AOO, EOO, and number of locations can be inferred.&#160;Maximum dispersal has been estimated at 1.0 to 1.6 km (Burke et al. 2011) for this species and locations are greater than 400 km apart, making migration among them unlikely. The habitat is therefore considered severely fragmented.",This species is not utilized for trade.,Terrestrial,"The Powesheik Skipperling was assigned a status of Endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act and assessed as Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). The majority of remaining sites are in protected areas that are being managed to protect the species. Unfortunately, several sites are still threatened by non-native invasive species and vegetative succession of woody species. Management for Powesheik Skipperling is uniquely challenging, as management practices such as burning, that could reduce this succession, can also cause larval mortality. With remaining habitat as restricted as it is, any management must be implemented with utmost care and steps should be taken to avoid or minimize larval mortality. State, provincial and federal agencies are working throughout the range to protect and manage the rare and remaining habitat patches. Much remains unknown about the species and the reasons for its population declines in recent decades; research is needed to better understand the species' life history and ecology as well as its population size, distribution, and trends. Since being listed as Endangered in Canada and the United States, increased monitoring efforts at remaining sites have been informative and made a valuable contribution to conservation efforts. It is of the utmost importance that monitoring of the species' population and habitat trends continue. While some threats have been identified, it is still not fully understood why the species has faced such significant population reductions. Further research into threats and conservation actions are needed. Work is currently being done to establish a Powesheik Skipperling head starting program in the United States as recommended by an Ex Situ Feasibility Assessment and Planning Workshop held in 2015 (Delphey et al.&#160;2016). This, and future ex-situ conservation efforts, contribute to the growing body of knowledge of Powesheik life history and ecology and could play an important role in reversing the current population trend.",Nearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
279,South America,Mesoclemmys hogei,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,TESTUDINES,REPTILIA,CHELIDAE,Mesoclemmys,hogei,A2bcd+4bcd,"Mesoclemmys hogei is threatened on an ongoing basis by habitat degradation and targeted and accidental mortality in fisheries. Of 18 known subpopulations, 10 have been lost in the past 40 years, corresponding to roughly a 60% loss of sites during an estimated two turtle generations (generation time conservatively estimated as c. 20 years). This calculates to well over 80% reduction in number of animals over a three-generation period, as the numbers of individuals in the remaining populations have declined, when calculated over both the three past generations and the past two generations plus expected impacts facing the next generation. Survey data (Moreira 2003) already argued this restricted-range endemic species' status as at least Endangered in Brazil by 2003, and noted it to be the 'most endangered species of turtle in Brazil'. On balance of available information and ongoing habitat destruction and loss since 2003, M. hogei is now assessed as Critically Endangered (Drummond et al. 2015, Coutinho et al. 2015).&#160;","Mesoclemmys hogei is a highly aquatic species that inhabits lakes and small rivers; juveniles have been reported from small streams. All available locality records are from below 500 m altitude (Rhodin&#160;et al.&#160;1982).&#160;The species&#160;reaches a maximum size of at least 38.0 cm carapace length (CL) and average weight of 2.75 kg (male) and 38.4 cm CL, average weight 3.00 kg, maximum recorded mass 4.55 kg (female) (Rhodin&#160;et al.&#160;1982, Moreira 2003, Moreira et al. 2003, Drummond et al. 2015). Mature females nest between January and April, producing clutches of 5-11 eggs (Drummond and Coutinho unpubl. data). The age at maturity is estimated at around 15 years (Drummond and Coutinho 2011). Similar to other medium-sized chelid turtles, a minimum generation time of 20 years appears appropriate.","Habitat destruction is the principal cause of population declines in this species (Moreira 1994, Drummond and Molina 2008, Drummond and Coutinho 2015). This species is also threatened by overexploitation and long-line fishing (Rodrigues 2005, Drummond et al. 2013). The Carangola River population had a small proportion of juveniles compared to adults, suggesting that the decline in population size could be due to inadequate recruitment (Moreira 2003, &#160;Drummond et al. 2015) The most probable cause of lack of recruitment is predation of eggs and hatchlings, but also reduced fecundity due to senility or pollution must also be considered. Mesoclemmys hogei&#160;has been listed as Critically Endangered in Brazil since 2014.","Most of the known localities for this species have been sampled since 1992, and only two thriving populations are still found in the Carangola and Para√≠ba do Sul Rivers, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, respectively (Drummond and Coutinho 2009). At all other sites less than five turtles were collected and, at most sites none were found at all. Studies in the Carangola River started in 1992, when an index of population size was first obtained based on capture success using Fike nets in an area of 5.0 km of river stream. From October 2000 to June 2002 the same methodology was applied along the 150 km of the Carangola River, from the headwaters to the estuary, and turtles were captured in about 40 km of the main channel (Moreira 2003).&#160;From October 2008 to December 2015, the same area was sampled and turtles were found in only 15 km of the main Carangola River (Drummond et al. 2011;&#160;Drummond et al. unpubl. data).&#160;The total number of turtles captured ranged from 20 in 1992 to 147 in 2015, but capture success, calculated as the number of turtles captured by unit effort, decreased steadily from 0.71 in 1992 to 0.05 in 2015. The trend in the index of population size was calculated based on the regression slope (1-e-√ü), showing that since 1992, the population in the Carangola River had been declining at a mean annual rate of 16.2%, and is expected to experience local extinction in less than seven years‚Äô time if no conservation actions are adopted&#160;(Drummond et al. unpubl. data). Additionally, recent DNA studies revealed that the&#160;Carangola population had very low genetic variability, probably related to a bottleneck effect experienced in the past&#160;(Carvalho et al. unpubl. data).&#160;Given that the Carangola River is a strategic site to the conservation of&#160;M. hogei, we suggest that strong action should be taken in order to prevent further damage to the natural population and that the species' threat status be revised to Critically Endangered.",Decreasing,"Mesoclemmys hogei inhabits low-lying areas in the Rio Paraiba drainage of the state of Rio de Janeiro and southern Minas Gerais, and in the nearby Rio Itapemirim drainage of southern Espirito Santo; it may possibly inhabit tributaries of the Rio Tiete drainage. The total range is 400 km long at most, substantially less if the Rio Tiete record proves to be in error, as it probably is (Mittermeier et al. 1980, Rhodin et al. 1982).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Basic research on the distribution, status and conservation biology of the species has been carried out, indicating that the species is restricted and highly localized in its distribution, in decline, and rare where it persists. Positive conservation actions are urgently needed, including identification and effective protection of key habitat, engagement (including possible conservation incentive programs) of local communities to minimize subsistence exploitation and bycatch mortality, and possibly establishment of an ex situ assurance colony.

The population of this iguana is very small (192 mature individuals) and prone to genetic, demographic, and environmental stochasticity. Population trends are unknown but there is genetic evidence of past reduction and current juvenile recruitment has not been observed. Black Rats and feral cats are present in the range and are likely predators, as is known for other Gal√°pagos iguanas. The presence of ectoparasites and possible endoparasites is a potential concern and its impact on population fitness is unknown. Hybridization and introgression between C. marthae and C. subcristatus has occurred in the past on Volc√°n Wolf, the extent and effect of which has not been fully evaluated yet. Volcanic eruptions and periodic droughts may also impact this species.","The Gal√°pagos Pink Land Iguana (Conolophus marthae) is found coexisting with a subpopulation of Gal√°pagos Land Iguana (Conolophus subcristatus) on Volc√°n Wolf. Altitudinal shifts along the slopes of the volcano imply different environmental conditions, which ultimately are reflected by different types of vegetation. The habitat includes tropical dry shrubland at the top of the volcano and tropical dry forest along the slopes. Vegetation at the highest altitudes may be impacted by droughts. The head nodding behaviour of C. marthae is very distinctive and completely different from C. subcristatus and may be a barrier to hybridization. Basic reproductive biology of this iguana is unknown. In late spring 2010, a few C. marthae females were observed carrying 4-7 eggs in their follicles, investigated by a portable ultrasound machine (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2011). These data would indicate a much smaller clutch size than for the geographically closest population of C. subcristatus on Fernandina Island (7-23 eggs, Werner 1982). It is still unclear whether C. marthae and C. subcristatus have overlapping reproductive seasons and if the two species may compete for nesting sites on Volc√°n Wolf; the location of these nests is unknown. Average snout-to-vent length (SVL) of animals observed is 46.8 cm, males being significantly larger than females. The SVL of the smallest male Gal√°pagos Pink Land Iguana captured was 37.3 cm, a size that broadly corresponds to the SVL in seven-year old Gal√°pagos Land Iguana individuals (37.5 cm ¬± 6.0 SD) from Santa Cruz, and even older individuals from Plaza Sur."," The population of Gal√°pagos Pink Land Iguana is extremely small and prone to both demographic and genetic stochasticity, as well as environmental stochasticity (volcanic eruptions, droughts). Because of the overlapping range with Gal√°pagos Land Iguana, hybridization may occur, generating introgression between C. marthae and C. subcristatus on Volc√°n Wolf. Although there is no evidence of living F1 hybrids at present, DNA evidence shows that rare events of hybridization have occurred, though the severity of subsequent introgression has not been fully evaluated yet (Gentile et al. 2009, Fulvo 2010).&#160; Because the population is so small, rare events of hybridization may have a significant effect on the species. In addition to the Gal√°pagos Hawk (Buteo galapagoensis), the only native predator of Gal√°pagos Pink Land Iguanas on Volc√°n Wolf, invasive alien Black Rats (Rattus rattus) and feral cats (Felis catus) are potential predators of eggs and hatchlings. It is known that feral cats prey on Gal√°pagos Land Iguanas up to three and four years old. Animals in this age class represent a size that has not been found among Pink Iguanas. Therefore, it is suspected that feral cats pose a significant threat to population recruitment in Gal√°pagos Pink Land Iguanas. Volc√°n Wolf is an active volcano, with several eruptions recorded in the last century, most recently in 1982. Most recent lava is found on the eastern and southern sides of the volcano and in the caldera (Geist et al. 2005). Eruptions may have caused local extinctions of populations of C. subcristatus in the past, for example, Volc√°n Chico (on the eastern side of Volc√°n Sierra Negra) in 1979 (Snell et al. 1984).  Droughts may be severe on the top of Volc√°n Wolf. Although adults are expected to cope fairly well with drought since they obtain water from consumed plants, the resultant scarcity of food may potentially cause aborted reproduction for the year due to a combination of lack of egg laying, a higher number of infertile eggs laid, and poor juvenile survival. Ectoparasite load is high in both Gal√°pagos Land Iguanas and Pink Iguanas on Volc√°n Wolf. In fact, the location is characterized by a massive occurrence of ticks, which are much more abundant in Volc√°n Wolf than elsewhere in the archipelago. Both C. marthae and the C. subcristatus populations from Volc√°n Wolf show an unbalanced leukocyte formula compared to other populations of land iguanas from the whole archipelago. This could be related to the presence of ticks, but could also indicate a possible endoparasitic infection affecting most individuals (Fulvo 2010). This issue and how it might effect the fitness of the two populations is under investigation.&#160;  There is no current or known historic human use or trade of this species.","A single wild population of Gal√°pagos Pink Land Iguana exists and it is not found ex situ. Recently, the effective population size (Ne) has been estimated as large as 41.21 individuals (95% CL = 30.71-67.97) by using microsatellite data (9 loci) (Fulvo 2010). Mark-recapture data, by applying the Lincoln-Petersen method from two contiguous temporal samples in 2009 and 2010 (percentage of recapture = 53%), would indicate 192 adult individuals (95% CL = 155-260). Sex ratio estimated from samples collected in May 2009 was one male to 0.59 females and one male to 0.51 females in July 2010 (Gentile and Fulvo 2011). Past and future population trends are impossible to assess due to the lack of a sufficiently long series of estimates of population size. Monomorphism for a single mitochondrial DNA haplotype in a sample of 102 iguanas strongly suggests that the Gal√°pagos Pink Land Iguana might have suffered severe demographic contractions in the past (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2011). From 2005 to 2011, 133 adult individuals were captured and permanently marked with brands and Passive Integrated Transponders, representing nearly all observed Pink Iguanas (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2011). During these surveys, no juveniles were observed, suggesting population recruitment appears to be non-effective.",Unknown,"The Gal√°pagos Pink Land Iguana is a recently described species endemic to Volc√°n Wolf, a single location on Isla Isabela. Based on direct observations (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2011) and reports of the Gal√°pagos National Park surveys, this iguana has never been observed outside an area larger than 25 km¬≤. The maximum area surrounding the geographic capture points of all individuals observed to date is 10.9 km¬≤, with more than 95% of observations clustering in a much smaller area (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2011). The iguana occurs along the northern slopes of the volcano, in an area ranging from 600-1,700 m asl. There may be a seasonal shift in altitude with Pink Iguanas concentrating at the crater rim at 1,700 m during the months of May-July and descending down to 600 m when vegetation starts drying out. This iguana has not been seen inside the caldera.",There is no current or known historic human use or trade of this species.,Terrestrial,"All species of Gal√°pagos Land Iguanas (Conolophus spp.) are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The known geographic range of Gal√°pagos Pink Land Iguana is within the Gal√°pagos National Park, the legal authority governing and protecting biological diversity of the Gal√°pagos Islands. The Land Iguanas are included in the Management of Native and Endemic Species Program, as part of the Management Plan of the Gal√°pagos National Park. The Gal√°pagos National Park undertakes major campaigns to control and eradicate invasive alien species in the Gal√°pagos, including on Volc√°n Wolf. Such actions have so far successfully prevented habitat disturbance by feral goats in northern Isabela and promoted habitat restoration of southern Isabela. In the early 2000s, a three-year programme to eradicate feral cats from the island of Baltra (where C. subcristatus was repatriated from 1991 onwards) was effective by initially poisoning with sodium monofluoroacetate (compound 1080), then trapping or shooting the remaining cats (Phillips et al. 2005). However, the applicability of this protocol on Volc√°n Wolf is questionable due to the difficult terrain and is likely impossible for an island as large as Isla Isabela, an area of 4,588 km¬≤ (Nogales et al. 2004).&#160; Further evaluation of the feral cat population on Volc√°n Wolf is needed for the purpose of implementing a programme for their control.Based on successful programmes for the populations of C. subcristatus from Bah√≠a Cartago (Isabela), Santa Cruz, and Baltra islands (Snell et al. 1984), the National Park is also considering a captive-breeding programme for C. marthae. The University Tor Vergata (Rome, Italy) is actively assisting the Park in this regard. The Gal√°pagos Pink Land Iguana is not in contact with humans in Gal√°pagos except for the purpose of scientific investigation and management. The Gal√°pagos National Park does not envision a plan to include Volc√°n Wolf in the list of touristic sites nor other possible intrusions to the population. Nevertheless, as the species is endemic and has a very limited distribution, the National Park has added a specific educational module focused on this species in the courses aimed at training and updating nature guides. This training ensures proper information is conveyed to visiting tourists. Information on the population biology and ecology of Pink Iguanas is very limited and research has begun. Research needs include monitoring of population and habitat trends, diet analysis, and in-depth study of the reproductive biology of this species. Clarifying the frequency of hybridization and level of genetic introgression between C. marthae and C. subcristatus is urgently needed. Additionally, the health status of the population should be monitored and the possible impact of a high parasite load on the fitness of the population should be investigated.&#160;Additionally, in the event a captive breeding programme is started, the Gal√°pagos National Park, in collaboration with the University Tor Vergata, will develop an education programme for local people and tourists. It is extremely difficult and expensive to access the study area. The need to transport equipment to and from the site limits the duration of research trips and consequently the extent of research that can be conducted on any one trip. The construction of a small low-impact, temporary field structure near the top of volcano would greatly help by allowing longer field trips and more effective research work and monitoring.&#160;",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Recent studies on the extent of range reductions and demographic declines (Gallego-Garc√≠a and Casta√±o-Mora 2008; Restrepo et al. 2008; P√°ez et al. 2009, 2015a;&#160;Morales-Betancourt et al. 2015) argue that its classification should be elevated to Critically Endangered, with at least c. 80% population reductions over three generations (c. 30-45 years).&#160; Quantitative analysis (P√°ez et al. 2015a) in the Magdalena River indicated that generation time is approximately 10 years, and for this population the rate of annual decline is 8.8%. Stochastic projections predicted a local extinction in less than three generations (25 years). Many extant populations throughout the distributional range of the species currently face heavy subsistence and commercial exploitation and several show apparent low densities (Vargas-Ramirez et al. 2006; P√°ez et al. 2015a). Some populations in the upper San Jorge River have already been extirpated (Vargas-Ramirez et al. 2006; C√°rdenas-Ar√©valo et al. 2015). This species is therfore assessed here as Critically Endangered.","P√°ez et al. (2009, 2012) provided an extensive review of the habitats and ecology of&#160;P. lewyana.&#160;The species&#160;is primarily seen along the banks of rivers, although it is also possible to find individuals in small tributaries, lagoons, and flooded areas connected to rivers. Individuals are often observed basking on banks or fallen trunks along the shoreline, either alone or in groups including various size classes (Gallego-Garcia and Casta√±o-Mora 2008; Restrepo et al. 2008). Smaller individuals tend to occur in shallower, more turbid waters or in flooded pastures, with adults more selective of deeper, wider channels (Gallego-Garc√≠a and Casta√±o-Mora 2008; P√°ez et al.&#160;2015a).Nesting occurs in sand or gravel beaches, as well as in banks and pastures during the months of low river levels. Mean clutch sizes is 22 eggs, with a range of 10-31 eggs (Dahl and Medem 1964; Medem 1965; Casta√±o-Mora 1986; Correa-Hern√°ndez 2006; Cano 2007; Gallego-Garc√≠a and Casta√±o-Mora 2008).&#160; Based upon a sample size of approximately 1000 individuals (P√°ez, unpubl. data) adult males on average measure 24.6 cm SCL (range 20-35 cm) with an average weight of 1.6 kg (range 0.7-4.3 kg), while adult females average 37 cm SCL (range 30-46 cm) and on average weigh 5.6 kg (range 2,2-10.4 kg). Hatchlings measure 42-46 mm SCL and weigh 16-22 gram. It has been documented that P. lewyana nests are laid in both the verano and veranillo low water periods each year, but it is not clear whether individual females nest in both periods each year. However, within each period, there is wide variance around the female size/clutch size regression. This often results in species where females of a given body size lay progressively smaller clutches when re-nesting during a nesting season. It is suspected that female P. lewyana in the study population deposited one or more nests during both nesting seasons each year.&#160;Males attain sexual maturity at approximately 20 cm SCL, corresponding to 3-4 years of age. Females first nest at 30 cm SCL, at an approximate age of 5-6 years old. The generation time is approximately 10 years (P√°ez et al. 2012, Ceballos et al. 2014, Gonz√°lez-Zarate et al. 2014, Ortiz-Yusti et al. 2014, S√°nchez-Ospina et al. 2014, Zapata et al. 2014, Restrepo et al. 2015, Gallego-Garc√≠a and P√°ez 2016, P√°ez et al. 2015a,b).&#160; According to Gallego-Garcia and Forero-Medina (in prep.), P. lewyana has high site fidelity, with males and females exhibiting comparable home range sizes (10.3 ha and 14.6 ha, respectively). In the middle Magdalena drainage, the main nesting season is during the primary dry season, from December to April, with a peak in March, and limited nesting also occurring in the secondary dry season from July to August. In the Prado River of the upper Magdalena drainage, the main nesting period is from June to September and a secondary nesting period occurs from December to May (Vargas-Ramirez, unpubl. data). In the Sin√∫ River, two seasons also have been documented in December to March and June to August (Gallego-Garc√≠a and Casta√±o-Mora 2008).","P√°ez et al. (2009, 2012) provided and extensive review of the threats to&#160;P. lewyana.&#160;Several factors that affect populations of the species have been identified throughout its distributional range: 1) habitat destruction and pollution; 2) traditional utilization and consumption; 3) commercial exploitation; and 4) hydrological changes due to dams (Gallego-Garcia 2004; Vargas-Ramirez et al. 2006, 2007b). Pastures and plantations have replaced original forest throughout a large portion of its territory. At urban centres and localities where extensive agriculture is the principal human activity (e.g., the upper Magdalena River), pollution of beaches and water bodies is common. Podocnemis lewyana is used as a source of protein for local people throughout its range. Various capture techniques are used, including hunting adult females with dogs on land during the nesting season, or in water by setting nets and hooks baited with plantain, or diving for individuals along the bottom of canals. In several fishing villages, turtles are also considered important for traditional medicinal purposes. In these communities, it is believed that consumption of turtles helps women to recover after pregnancy, cures skin and eye diseases, confers longevity and strength, and serves as an aphrodisiac. The nesting season includes Easter week each year, when hunting pressures rise notably to satisfy the demand for ‚Äúwhite meat‚Äù in the large cities on the nearby Caribbean coast. In the lower Magdalena and Sin√∫ rivers, some people exclusively dedicate their time to the capture, transport, and sale of turtles and eggs.In the Sin√∫ and&#160;tributaries of the Magdalena rivers (such as the Prado, La Miel, and Sogamoso rivers), hydroelectric dams have been constructed. Whenever water is released to produce energy during the dry season, beaches that were exposed become submerged. Flooding may last for several days and several of these flooding episodes may occur during a single dry season. The impact of these events has never been fully&#160;evaluated but it is likely that thousands of eggs are inundated and drowned every year (Gallego-Garc√≠a and Casta√±o-Mora 2008).When neonates begin to emerge from the nests, they also are hunted with the objective of selling them in the illegal pet trade (Casta√±o-Mora 1986, 1997; Rueda-Almonacid 1999). Moreover, habitat degradation caused by draining wetlands for agricultural or ranching ventures and the sedimentation of other water bodies seriously jeopardizes the survival chances of the species&#160;(Casta√±o-Mora 1997, 2002; Rueda-Almonacid 1999)."," Many extant populations throughout the distributional range of the species currently face heavy subsistence and commercial exploitation and several show apparent low densities (Vargas-Ramirez et al. 2006; P√°ez et al. 2009, 2015a). The only study that has estimated annual survival rates showed that they increase with body size (P√°ez et al. 2015a). &#160;Some populations in the upper San Jorge River have already been extirpated (Vargas-Ramirez et al. 2006).&#160;A quantitative analysis (P√°ez et al. 2015a) in the Magdalena River involving four years of mark-recapture effort in four sites estimated generation time as approximately 10 years, based on female body size growth data and mean size of nesting females. A projection matrix was constructed from the data from the four sites and a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis indicated the population was declining at an annual rate of 8.8%. An elasticity analysis indicated that the most important parameter for helping the population recover was survival of adults, followed by survival of other age classes, with survival of eggs and hatchlings having the least effect. Stochastic projections predicted a local extinction there in less than three generations (in approximately 25 years). ",Decreasing,"Podocnemis lewyana&#160;is endemic to&#160;Colombia with its presence documented in the Sin√∫ and Magdalena drainages, including the lower Cauca, San Jorge, and Nech√≠ tributaries (Iverson 1992; Rueda-Almonacid et al. 2007; P√°ez et al. 2009; Ortiz-Yusti et al. 2014). This distribution makes it a biogeographic anomaly, being the only South American podocnemid turtle to occur northwest of the Andes Mountains instead of inhabiting the Orinoco, Essequibo, or Amazon drainages. Also, there are records of its occurrence in the Rancher√≠a and Cocorn√° rivers (Hurtado 1973; Rhodin et al. 1978; Restrepo et al. 2008; Ortiz-Yusti et al. 2014; Ceballos et al. 2014). Its distributional limits are the Caribbean Sea to the north, Tolima Department to the south, and Antioquia Department to the west.&#160;An isolated population of&#160;P. lewyana&#160;also occurs above the Rodrigo Echand√≠a Hydroelectric Dam located on the Prado River in Tolima Department in the upper Magdalena drainage.&#160;It has also apparently been introduced by Colombian settlers into the Tarra River in the Lake Maracaibo basin of Venezuela (Pauler and Trebbau 1995).","Podocnemis lewyana&#160;is used as a source of protein for local people throughout its range. Various capture techniques are used, including hunting adult females with dogs on land during the nesting season, or in water by setting nets and hooks baited with plantain, or diving for individuals along the bottom of canals. In several fishing villages, turtles are also considered important for traditional medicinal purposes. In these communities, it is believed that consumption of turtles helps women to recover after pregnancy, cures skin and eye diseases, confers longevity and strength, and serves as an aphrodisiac. The nesting season includes Easter week each year, when hunting pressures rise notably to satisfy the demand for ‚Äúwhite meat‚Äù in the large cities on the nearby Caribbean coast. In the lower Magdalena and Sin√∫ rivers, some people exclusively dedicate their time to the capture, transport, and sale of turtles and eggs.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Podocnemis lewyana was last assessed by the IUCN TFTSG in 1996 as Endangered (EN) A1bd. It was assessed in 2002 as EN A1acd+A2acd in the Colombian Reptile Red Book (Casta√±o-Mora 2002). The species has also been listed in Appendix II of CITES since 1975, as are all other species in the genus. It was assessed again in 2015 as CR-E in the Colombian Reptile Red Book (Morales-Betancourt et al. 2015). Colombia prohibits the commercial exploitation of this species, as well as the collection of its eggs or hatchlings, by Resolution 0219 of the Ministry of Agriculture in 1964. Also, Resolution 126 by the Executive Directorate of the Regional Autonomous Corporation of the Magdalena and Sin√∫ Valleys in 1965 declared a closed season, prohibiting the sale or purchase of this species on a national scale. However, these legislative acts have not been accompanied by effective implementation programs and they remain largely unenforced. At present, there are no protected areas within the range of the species, so creation of a reserve where even subsistence hunting is regulated is clearly a top priority for this species. Most management projects for P. lewyana focus primarily on nest transfer and head-starting techniques (P√°ez et al. 2015b), and also usually include environmental education and community involvement programs. While nest transfer is obviously justified for populations that suffer nest loss each nesting season due to flooding caused by hydroelectic plant water discharges, the method, combined with head-starting, is probably not justifiable for other populations. Projection matrix analyses indicate that even with a 100% increase in egg and hatchling survival thanks to such management efforts, most populations would continue to decline at slightly lower rates. In contrast, efforts to reduce adult mortality via education campaigns with fishing communities, protection of nesting females on beaches, and other improvements to enforcement of legislation for protecting adults could reverse declines and permit population recoveries.&#160;",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

It feeds mainly on the endemic snail Plagiodontes patagonicus&#160;(Abdala et al. 2012), but also on beetles and spiders (Etheridge and Williams 1985).","The species is threatened by habitat loss due to the advance of invasive plant species such as Tosquero Pine (Pinus halepensis) and blackberry (Rubus sp.). It is also potentially affected by illegal extraction by tourists (Abdala et al. 2012), but this is not a major threat at present. Because of pine plantations within the range of the species, the fire regime has changed to the detriment of the species' habitat.","This species is rare. A large team (more than 15 people) including experienced herpetologists, park rangers and tour guides have surveyed the known localities between 2013 and 2015, and have recorded only eight individuals at two of the known localities (F.

This is in one of the most heavily-disturbed areas of Colombia, considered here as a single location defined by a widespread threat from agricultural conversion. Natural habitat at the type locality no longer exists and remnant forest in this area is sufficiently small, and this species sufficiently rare, that this snake may also qualify as a severely fragmented population. It is presumed to be undergoing a continuing decline in the quality of any remaining habitat due to land use intensification.","There is very little information on the ecology of this species, which has only recently been rediscovered, in a largely degraded area. The known localities correspond to an area historically characterized by rainforest (R. Caicedo and J. Lynch pers. obs.). The type locality is now entirely converted to sugarcane cultivation; it is unknown whether natural habitat existed here in 1938, when the holotype was collected, but it is likely that it was forested (J. Daza and R. Caicedo pers. comm. 2013). The recent collection was of an animal taken on the roadside close to a creek surrounded by secondary forest, within a matrix of pastureland (Morales-Betancourt et al. 2015). The species is presumed to be associated with vegetated streams and to prey on frogs, in common with related species.","The area where this species was collected was resurveyed recently, with no new records obtained in a survey in 2011-2012 (R. Caicedo pers. comm. 2016). The area is now a sugarcane plantation, in which the species can probably not persist; one of the recent records was taken near, but not within, the type locality (Morales-Betancourt et al. 2015). Although other species of Dendrophidion can be found in open areas, the failure to rediscover this species in repeated surveys over more than 70 years suggests that this snake is either very rare or has been lost following land conversion. This conclusion is however complicated by the poor state of preservation of the holotype, which makes assigning new material to this species difficult. The only species of Dendrophidion recently found at the type locality is, however, D. percarinatum, a species which is highly distinct from D. boshelli (R. Caicedo, unpub. data). A recently-discovered locality close by is within an area entirely converted to livestock agriculture and plantations for sugarcane, cocoa and corn, where remnant forest is very small and survives only on very steep slopes (Morales-Betancourt et al. 2015). It is likely that this species is a specialist feeder on amphibians, as are other members of this genus, and so it may be affected to some degree by amphibian declines.","Nothing is known about the population status of this species, which is known only from the holotype and two recent collections of single individuals.",Unknown,"This species was described from Volcanes, Caparrapi, in Colombia's Department of Cundinamarca (Dunn 1944); the exact location of this locality is not known (R.

288,South America,Squatina occulta,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,SQUATINIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,SQUATINIDAE,Squatina,occulta,A2bd,"The Hidden Angelshark (Squatina occulta) is a medium-sized shark (to 160 cm total length) endemic to the Southwest Atlantic inhabiting waters from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Buenos Aires Province, Argentina and likely further south to the northern Patagonia-Argentine region. It is mainly found on the continental shelf at depths of 10-150 m, but has been found at depths to 350 m. The species' low reproductive potential (litter size of 4-10 and a possible three-to-five-year female breeding cycle) together with its susceptibility to capture in both trawl and gillnet gear makes it highly susceptible to population depletion. Angel sharks are heavily fished in southern Brazil and significant reductions have been documented there.&#160;In the period from 1988 to 2002, on the continental shelf of southern Brazil, the abundance of Squatina species was reduced by approximately 85%, and benthic trawl fishing continued to intensively exploit this population in more recent years. In the same region, scientific fishing cruises conducted between 1986 to 2001 using bottom trawls revealed that the frequency of occurrence and CPUE (in kg/hour and number of individuals/hour) of this species was reduced by 80% confirming trends observed in commercial fisheries. In Argentina, trawl catches of Squatina underwent a reduction of 58% in the years 1992-1998, showing a continuing negative trend since then. These are the equivalent of a &gt;99% reduction over three generation lengths (46.5 years), however there may be other areas within its range where fishing intensity is not as high. The catch and trade of this species has been banned in Brazil since 2004, but it is still targeted illegally and caught as bycatch and sold in markets. Given the species' relatively low productivity, the presence of intensive fisheries throughout the species' range, and the level of localized reductions reported, the Hidden Angelshark is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of over 80% over three generation lengths (46.5 years) across its range, and is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Hidden Angelshark is a medium-sized (to 160 cm total length; TL) demersal shark (Ebert et al. 2013). The species occurs at depths of 10-350 m; it is found most commonly throughout the year from 50 to 100 m from the mid- and outer continental shelf, and is scarce at depths of 10 to 20 m and from 100 to 350 m (Vooren and da Silva 1991).&#160;Hidden Angelsharks are lecithotrophic viviparous. Males mature at 82 cm TL and females at 89 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). The breeding cycle of the females lasts at least two years. The gestation period is approximately 11 months, and young are born in spring. The breeding cycle of the female may take 4-5 years, with variation between individuals (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Uterine fecundity ranges from 4 to 10, with an average of 7 embryos, and the size at birth is 30 cm TL. Birth occurs in summer months, usually at depths of 60 to 80 m (Vooren and Klippel 2005). 100% sexual maturity occurs from the age of 10 years and the longevity is at least 21 years (Vooren and Klippel 2005). According to available data on longevity, reproductive ages and duration of the reproductive cycle, females may produce a maximum of five litters throughout an individual's reproductive life. This species has a calculated generation length of 15.5 years. Similar to other Squatina species, the Hidden Angelshark carries out its entire life cycle on the shelf, with no seasonal migrations between depths or regions reported. However, females may move to shallower (60-80 m) coastal waters to give birth (Vooren and Klippel 2005).","The major threats to populations of Hidden Angelshark are bottom trawls and bottom-set gillnets. Until 1989, bottom trawl gears targeting demersal fish mainly caught Squatina species in Brazil. Although this type of fishing gear continues to operate, from 1990 the introduction of bottom gillnets increased on the shelf and slope off southern Brazil, leading to an increase in the capture of angel shark species. Gillnets were reported as six times more effective at catching angel sharks than trawling alone (Vooren and Klippel 2005). This efficiency is due to two factors: first, the nocturnal behavior of the species determines the high vulnerability to night fishing with bottom gillnets; secondly, this fleet practices directed fishing of angel sharks with stretched mesh of 35 to 40 cm between opposing nodes. For these reasons, fishing with gillnets is the main threat to the remaining populations of Squatina species (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Although angel sharks were heavily targeted by these nets in the early 2000s, depletion has led them to be caught more infrequently and the targeted fishery is no longer profitable (Mafra Pio et al. 2016). Currently, the Itaja√≠ fleet (Santa Catarina, Brazil) is responsible for most of the fishing effort on the South Platform. In 2007, in the port of Itaja√≠, 61% of the Squatina catches came from the bottom gillnet fleet, and 39% from bottom trawling. These two fishing modalities are the main extrinsic factors that affect the population of this species in Brazil (Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren and Klippel 2005).Gravid females have been observed to abort embryos easily upon capture, further reducing the reproductive capacity (Vooren and Klippel 2005). A low rate of dispersal between populations also makes them especially prone to local depletion and means that recolonization will be extremely low. In Uruguay, there is little direct fishing for angel sharks, but they are taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries (Paesch and Domingo 2003).In Argentina, Chiaramonte (1998) stated that Squatina species were the second most important fish landed by the gillnet fleet of Puerto Quequen (Buenos Aires Province), however this was mostly the Angular Angelshark.","Angel sharks in the Southwest Atlantic are notoriously difficult to distinguish and catches and landings are typically reported at the genus level. Unless otherwise stated the information below refers to the genus as a whole (i.e. combined catch or landings of all Squatina species that are native to the region). BrazilIn the period from 1988 to 2002, on the continental shelf of Rio Grande do Sul, the abundance of Squatina species was reduced by approximately 85%, and bottom trawling continued to intensively exploit this population in the early 2000s (Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren and Klippel 2005). In S√£o Paulo State, the gillnet fleet began directed fishing on Squatina species in 1997, collapsing during the year 2005 (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Angel shark stocks remain depleted as a result of ongoing incidental catch (Mafra Pio et al. 2016). In the same region (continental shelf of southern Brazil), scientific fishing cruises conducted between 1986 to 2001 using bottom trawls reveals that the frequency of occurrence and CPUE (in kg/hour and number of ind./hour) of this species (i.e. not aggregated Squatina spp.) underwent a reduction of approximately 80%, confirming trends observed in commercial fisheries (-85% between 1988 and 2002) (Vooren and Klippel 2005).Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ) In Uruguay, angel sharks are caught by trawling on the platform and declared as ‚Äúangelito‚Äù. Annual catches by Uruguay of Argentinian, Angular, and Hidden Angelsharks combined were about 300 t in the years 1998-2001 (Paesch and Domingo 2003). The estimated capture has been 200 to 400 metric tons (MT) per year between 1997 and 2005. Between 1997 and 2010 the average of angel sharks declared landings was 277 t and decreased to 50 t in 2011 and 2012 to rise again to 170 t in 2013 (Domingo et al. 2015). There is no clear trend in the landings data from Uruguay from 1996 to 2018 (CTMFM 2018). There are no statistics by species, but during research surveys in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ), Milessi et al. (2001) found that Angular Angelshark was the dominant species in the catch. Argentinian landings in the AUCFZ underwent a reduction of 51% between 1996 and 2017, equivalent to a 78% reduction over three generation lengths (CTMFM 2018).&#160; Argentina (south of the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone)Total captures of angel sharks in Argentina oscillated around 1,000 MT between 1979 and 1984 then increased to maximums of over 4,000 MT in the 1990s. In 1991 as much as 4,167 MT were taken, and 4,281 MT in 1996. Peaks were reached in 1997 and 1998, before landings dropped in 2002 to 2,000 MT, rising again in 2003 to 3,550 MT (Massa et al. 2004). Thus, there has been an overall negative trend in landings during the period 1998 to 2003 (Massa et al. 2004). Massa and Hozbor (2003) suggested a 58% reduction in the CPUE of angel shark in the coastal bottom trawl fleet, and this trajectory has continued since (although these fisheries there are thought to catch mostly Angular Angelshark; G. Chiaramonte unpubl. data 2018). Overall, given reported past population reductions, ongoing heavy fishing pressure across its range, and its low productivity, the Hidden Angelshark is inferred to have undergone reductions of more than 80% over the past three generations (46.5 years).",Decreasing,"The Hidden Angelshark occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (24ÀöS), through Uruguay to the Puerto Quequ√©n, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (38ÀöS) (Estalles et al. 2016). Vooren and Klippel (2005) suggested that the species might be present south to 45ÀöS along the northern Patagonia-Argentine region, however, this requires confirmation.","Angel sharks, including this species, are caught and retained as valuable bycatch in trawl and gillnet fisheries. There are both directed and indirect fisheries that catch this species in Argentina and Brazil, while there is little direct fishing of the species in Uruguay, where it is mostly caught as bycatch. Angel shark meat is sold fresh or salted and dried for local consumption. In Brazil, the meat is marketed as ca√ß√£o-anjo and is typically more valuable than other shark meat which is simply known as ca√ß√£o (P. Dolphine unpubl. data 2018). Although it has been illegal to retain angel sharks in Brazil since 2004, the meat of this species does still show up in markets (Bornatowski et al. 2018, Almer√≥n-Souza et al. 2018). Since 2000, Brazilian imports of shark meat have increased eight-fold (Dent and Clarke 2015). Furthermore, Brazil imports more than 90% of the production of Squatina spp. from Argentina (J.-M. Cuevas unpublished data). This indicates a growing market in Brazil and may indicate depletion of the domestic Brazilian portion of the population.",Marine,"Retention of the Hidden Angelshark has been banned in Brazil since 2004, but the species is still caught illegally. In Brazil, there is no control of the shelf angel shark fishery, and although trawling in inshore waters is prohibited in some areas for some some periods, enforcement of this regulation is difficult. Because it is listed on the Brazil National Red List, the species is among the priorities of the Brazilian Action Plan for the Conservation of Marine Elasmobranchs. The species, however, was the target of fisheries in the 1980s and 1990s and never stopped being landed in Brazil (as target and bycatch). Recent data indicates that its occurrence in both landings and markets is still frequent (Bornatowski et al. 2018, Alm√©ron-Souza et al. 2018). The species was evaluated in Brazil as over-exploited in 2004 (Minist√©rio do Meio Ambiente 2004), Critically Endangered in 2011 (Vooren et al. 2018), and was re-evaluated again in 2017 as Critically Endangered (not yet validated), and was fully protected in Brazil as of 2014 by the normative instructions numbers 5 and 445.&#160; In September 2018, the government of the state of Rio Grande do Sul approved a law that extends the range in which fishing with trawls is prohibited. With the sanction and regulation of the law, the protected area will be increased from 3 nautical miles (5.5 km) offshore to 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore. Nursery areas of the species have not been found in southern Brazil and may exist further south off Uruguay and/or Argentina. A new abundance estimate in southern Brazil is urgently needed after almost a decade of no-take protection in the country. At the same time an assessment of the relative composition of each species in commercial landings in each country is needed. There is only one specifically managed fishing area for chondrichthyans in the Argentine Sea and it is located inside the Argentina and Uruguay Common Fishing Zone between 36¬∞ and 37¬∞ S. This coastal area of about 4,562 km2 is closed from October to March and protects diverse species and reproductive stages of demersal and benthic chondrichthyans (Colonello et al. 2014), including angel sharks. The total amount of days changes between years and it is applied to all types of vessels using bottom net trawling.&#160; The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for chondrichthyans in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ) is regulated by the Binational Technical Comision (Comisi√≥n T√©cnica Mixta del Frente Mar√≠timo). Only 3 groups are regulated by a TAC limit each year: the smoothhound Mustelus schmitti, the angel sharks Squatina spp. and skates (Rajiformes). The TAC for angel sharks was constant between 2012 and 2016 (2,600 tonnes) and only in 2012 was this exceeded, with a total catch of 2709.2 t for Argentina and 27 t for Uruguay. Since 1992 there is a Maximum Permitted Catch (MPC) for angel sharks in Argentinian waters south of the AUCFZ, which was 6,000 MT in the years 1995 to 1999 and thereafter was reduced to 4,000 MT (Massa et al. 2003). However, these MPC values are not respected: 4230 MT were taken in 2006, 4294 MT in 2007, 5214 MT in 2008, 5064 MT in 2009, 5277 MT in 2010 and 4509 MT in 2011 (Fisheries statistics published by the Undersecretariat of Fisheries and Aquaculture of the Argentine Republic (http://www.minagri.gob.ar/site/pesca/pesca_maritima/02-desembarques/ins).Molecular markers of Squatina spp. have been determined for future identification of these species in local markets (Falc√£o et al. 2014). Research and monitoring of population size and landings are needed across this species‚Äô range. Although the Argentine and Angular Angelsharks were assessed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2015 (Casselberry and Carlson 2015) and later listed as Endangered under the US Endangered Species Act in 2017, this species was not assessed or considered for inclusion under the Act. &#160;   ",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

A quantitative analysis has&#160;indicated that the species has undergone a severe population decline, which occurred more than 10 years or three generations ago, possibly due to a combination of effects, such as habitat loss, chytridiomycosis and other factors.&#160;Despite intensive field search efforts performed between 2008 and 2017, no additional specimens have been found. However, data from recently rediscovered sister taxa have provided insight into the phenology of this species, suggesting that surveys need to be conducted within a narrow window and under optimal weather conditions. Nevertheless, if surveys continue and no observation is confirmed before 2029,&#160;it would be reasonable to conclude that this species is extinct.","This species has a narrow range of microhabitat preference (Vaira 2002). Adult individuals occur arboreally in tree crowns, tree holes and rock crevices in montane Yungas forests (Laurent et al. 1986). Although there are records of this species persisting in moderately disturbed habitats for a few decades, intensification of the disturbance eventually led to the species' disappearance in these areas (Vaira 2003, Vaira et al. 2011). Males call, generally hidden in rock crevices, during April‚ÄìJune and August‚ÄìNovember (Laurent et al. 1986, Vaira 2002). During amplexus, males place eggs in the marsupial pouch on the female's back (Barrio 1976). The eggs hatch and complete their development into froglets within the pouch (Laurent et al. 1986).","In 1996, at Abra Colorada outside of Calilegua National Park, road maintenance activities were observed destroying the rock where the species was observed breeding during previous surveys (M. Vaira pers. comm. October 2017). Subsequent annual surveys were unable to locate the species at that site, with conclusions that the subpopulation had been extirpated. Nonetheless, suitable habitat remains within the national park at present. The current major threat to this species is habitat loss outside of the park, mainly due selective logging of valuable woody species, clear cutting of primary forest and forestation with exotic species, extensive cattle raising, and transportation&#160;development projects (Lavilla and Heatwole 2010, Akmentins et al. 2012).&#160;Tests were performed on the last collected specimens from&#160;1996 to search for chytrid fungus infection by histological determination; however, these analyses proved negative (M.S. Akmentins unpubl. data).&#160;Nevertheless, the hypothesis of chytrid-related declines in this species should not be discarded (Akmentins&#160;et al. 2012), as it is possible, though not necessarily provable, that the rapid decline and apparent disappearance of this species in the 1990s was related, at least in part, to chytridiomycosis&#160;(rapid declines in some other amphibian species where suitable habitat remains have been attributable to chytridiomycosis).&#160;","The last time that this species was recorded was in 1996, up until which it was locally common both within and outside&#160;Calilegua National Park (M. Vaira pers comm. October 2017). The 2002 record reported in the 2004 assessment was in error (M. Vaira pers. comm. October 2017). Despite intensive field search efforts performed in the vicinity of the type locality and historic localities, between 2008 and 2017, no additional specimens have been found (M.S. Akmentins pers. comm. September 2017). The population is considered to be severely fragmented such that there is little or no dispersal between subpopulations.Indirect evidence from a population trend analysis and a series of probabilistic methods,&#160;based on historic records and museum specimens,&#160;showed a pattern of accelerated decline in the 1990s with a low possibility of this species' persistence (Akmentins&#160;et al. 2012). Nonetheless, rediscovery is still thought to be possible for a couple of reasons. Foremost, two of its sister species were recently rediscovered after 20 years (G. gracilis) and 25 years (G. chrysosticta) without any records, despite repeated visits to known sites (M. Vaira and M.S. Akmentins pers. comm. January 2018). It is possible that the current climate cycle is more favourable for these species and their populations may have recovered, and therefore have become more abundant and easier to detect (M. Vaira pers. comm. January 2018). Secondly, more precise data on the time window and optimal conditions to search for this species are now available based on the rediscovery of the two sister species (M. Vaira and M.S. Akmentins pers. comm. January 2018). These data indicate that this group of frogs are active during very specific conditions. &#160;Thus, it is possible that, despite intense searches, they have not been conducted at the appropriate time and under the correct conditions (M. Vaira and M.S. Akmentins pers. comm. January 2018). Additionally, automated digital recorders (""frogloggers"") have been deployed in several sites since 2017 which significantly increase the sampling effort and the probability of recording the species should it be present (M. Vaira and M.S. Akmentins pers. comm. January 2018). This greater sampling effort combined with a more favourable climate cycle and improved information on phenology may be the key to finding this species (M. Vaira and M.S. Akmentins pers. comm. January 2018).However, if the automated digital recorders and regular, targeted surveys continue and no observation is confirmed before 2029,&#160;it would be reasonable to conclude that this species is extinct (Akmentins&#160;et al. 2012).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Yungas Andean forests of north-western Argentina, and has been recorded from six localities in the&#160;Sierra de Callilegua in Jujuy Province and the&#160;Sierra de Porongal&#160;in Salta Province (Laurent 1967,&#160;Laurent et al. 1986; Vaira 2002,&#160;2003). In addition to its its type locality: 50 km from Calilegua along the route of Valla Grante (Laurent 1967), it has been recorded in&#160;Calilegua National Park including the vicinity of Abra de Ca√±as and R√≠o Jord√°n, and from Quebrada ""Pen√£ La Gateada"" in&#160;the&#160;Sierra de Porongal (Laurent&#160;et al.&#160;1986). Its altitudinal range is from 1,550-2,600 m asl (Duellman 2015) and its estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 51 km2.&#160;Specimens collected in the 1970s from Quebrada ""El Mateal"" (nearby Barit√∫ village in Barit√∫ National Park) to the north of the confirmed range have been attributed to this species, but in fact their taxonomic identity is uncertain (M.S. Akmentins pers. comm. 2019). Therefore, this subpopulation is retained in this assessment until taxonomic studies have clarified its identity, but is excluded from the EOO calculation.",There are no records of this species being utilized.,Terrestrial,"Conservation ActionsIt occurs within Barit√∫ and Calilegua&#160;National Parks.&#160;The threat status in the last Argentinean national assessment was increased from Vulnerable to Endangered (Vaira&#160;et al. 2012).&#160;Currently, there is a search/monitoring program for this species, employing a combination of passive and active survey techniques (M.S. Akmentins pers. comm. September 2017).Conservation NeededThere is a need for additional protection of Yungas habitat in the range of this species. A species recovery programme should be established should this species be found&#160;(Akmentins&#160;et. al. 2014), and an ex situ programme may need to be considered.&#160;Training of park ranger staff in amphibian species recognition may present the best opportunities for new sightings in the future (Akmentins&#160;et. al. 2014).Research NeededThere is an urgent need for field search efforts in historic localities and areas of probable occurrence in order to determine if this species&#160;is still extant, as keystone for any future conservation effort (Akmentins&#160;et al. 2012).&#160;Further research on this species' distribution, population size and trends, natural history, and threats is needed.",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

This threat is understood, but it is currently not ongoing due to national and international legislation blocking any trade of this species (CITES Appendix I). However continuing threats by persecution, habitat loss and the limited number of mature individuals occurring in protected areas constitute continuing concerns for this species. Estimations of mature population sizes were not completed across Orinoco Crocodile range before 1980. However, Medem (1981) estimated that between 1920 and 1950 a minimum of 254,000 skins from mature animals were exported. Mature population size estimates done in the 1980s in both Venezuela and Colombia report an overall mature population of ~550 individuals, 273 from Venezuela and 280 from Colombia. Current studies show a general reduction in these numbers in both Venezuela (Seijas et al. 2010) and Colombia (Lugo 1996), indicating that the situation for the species continues to decline. Lugo (1996) estimated an overall mature population size of 123 individuals in the Lipa, Cuiloto, Ele, Cravo Norte, Santo Domingo, Duda, Lozada, Alto Guayabero, Meta, and Vichada rivers. Currently, the population size is estimated at ~250 mature individuals across its range with the largest population harbouring ~40 mature animals in both Colombia (Ele, Lipa, Cravo Norte River System) and Venezuela (Cojedes River System and Capanaparo River). However, population size is not currently possible to be estimated in 17 out of the 34 areas reported with presence of the species (Balaguera-Reina et al. 2017).","The Orinoco Crocodile is one of the largest crocodylian species extant in the world (largest individual recorded 669 cm total length; Humboldt 1860 in Medem 1983). This species dwells a variety of habitats including rivers in tropical evergreen forest, piedmont streams in the foothills of the Andes, and seasonal rivers in savannas (Medem 1983). Females become mature at approximately 250 m total length (Antelo 2008), nesting in riverbanks between January and February (dry season) with hatchlings emerging around three months later, generally synchronized with the beginning of the wet season (Seijas et al. 2010). Eggs are laid in holes excavated by the female and clutch size range between 32 and 44 eggs, with a reported maximum of 66 eggs (Jim√©nez-Or√°a et al. 2007; Navarro 2007). Crocodylus intermedius is reported to aestivate in isolated streams or pools in the dry season, digging burrows into the riverbanks (Medem 1981, Antelo 2008).","Prior threat from over exploitation is no longer significant. However, low levels of illegal harvest due to fear of crocodiles and for local consumption are reported. Continuing threats are habitat change, habitat fragmentation, and pollution due to riverside development and human occupancy.","Crocodylus intermedius inhabits a wide variety of aquatic-land areas within the Orinoco basin, with the highest population numbers being recorded in seasonal rivers from savanna ecosystems (Medem 1981, Seijas et al. 2010). Orinoco Crocodile population data have been recorded from 34 areas [16 in Venezuela, 16 in Colombia, and two covering both countries (Meta River - Lower basin and Arauca River); Balaguera-Reina et al. 2017].Areas in Venezuela are: Guaritico and Macanillal System, Capanaparo River, Cojedes River System (Agua and Amarillo creeks, Cojedes-Sarare and Cojedes rivers), Manapire River System (Larga and Chig√ºichig√ºe lakes and Manapire River), Anaro River, Cinaruco River, Aguaro-Guariquito River, Camaguan Estero, Portuguesa River, Zuata River, Tucupido River System, Apure River, Ventuari River, and Orituco River.Regarding Colombia, studies have been done in Ele, Lipa, Cravo Norte River System, Guayabero River, Tomo River - (Tuparro National Natural Park), Duda River, Lozada River, Tillava, Planas, Guarrojo, and Muco rivers system, Vichada River, Manacacias River, Iteviare and Guaviare rivers, Cinaruco River upper basing, Capanaparo River, Ariporo River, Guanapalo and Meta rivers system (La Hermosa and Picapico creeks), Cravo Sur River, Casanare River, Casanare River, and la Aurora Natural Reserve (Ariporo and Chire rivers).Only 26 of these 34 areas (14 in Venezuela and 12 in Colombia) have at least two population surveys carried out in different years that allow analysis of current populations trends (Balaguera-Reina et al. 2017). Relative abundance values reported in Venezuela at these 14 localities ranged between 0 ind/km (Anaro River from 1990‚Äì1992 and 2000; Garavito 2003) and 10 ind/km (Laguna de Chig√ºichig√ºe-segment of the Manapire River, from 2008‚Äì2009; Arcila 2009). Some Orinoco Crocodile populations have increased in relative abundance through time with Laguna de Chig√ºichig√ºe having the highest population growth. In contrast, localities such as Ca√±o Amarillo-Merecure (creek) have been reduced from 4.9 ind/km between 1991 and 1997 to 1.78 in 2009. Cojedes River has shown an oscillation through the last 20 years with peaks of 5.8 ind/km in 1997 and troughs of 0.2 ind/km in 2006 (Seijas et al. 2010, Espinosa-Blanco 2010). The last study published in 2007 shows a relative abundance value of 4.1 ind/km (Espinosa-Blanco and Seijas 2012). Ca√±o Guaritico (creek) did not have any reported sightings between 1987 and 1988, but did between 1990 and 1994, 1998 and between 2002 and 2007 (Lugo-Rugeles 1998, Chavez 2000, Antelo 2008). Capanaparo River has faced a population decline of 63% between 2001 and 2011 (Moreno 2012).Population data from Colombia had been collected using a variety of survey methods (i.e., diurnal or nocturnal counts, and/or aerial surveys), of which several did not report the actual distances surveyed (instead they reported number of individuals/sector or zone). Regardless this disparity, ‚Äúof concern‚Äù data (where zero individuals were sighted) were reported from surveys carried out in La Hermosa and Picapico Creeks (1994 and 2010), Ariporo River (1994 and 1995), Cravo Sur River (1995 and 2010), and Tomo River (1995, 1996, and 1997; Lugo-Rugeles 1997, Castro et al. 2012). Other areas such as the Cravo Norte (1994‚Äì1995, 2000‚Äì2001, 2012), Casanare (1996, 2012), and the Orinoco (1994, 1995) Rivers, as well as the Guanapalo (2010) and Meta (1995, 1996, 1998, 2010, 2011, 2012) River System, have been studied over a 20-year span with relative abundances ranging from 0.0 to 0.81 ind/km (Lugo-Rugeles 1997, Castro et al. 2012, Barahona and Bonilla 1999, Ardila-Robayo et al. 2002, Rios and Trujillo 2004). The Lipa and Ele Rivers consistently had a low relative abundance value over a 15-year span (0.2 and 0.3 ind/km in 1995 and 2012; 0.3 ind/km in 1995 and 2001; 0.2 ind/km in 2012; Lugo-Rugeles 1997, Castro et al. 2012). However, Anzola and Antelo (2015) reported an increase in populations inhabiting the Lipa, Ele, and Cravo Norte River Systems over a 13 years-span based on nest surveys.Mature population size estimates done in the 1980s in both Venezuela and Colombia report an overall mature population of ~550 individuals, 273 from Venezuela in the Cojedes (76 individuals), Capanaparo (78 individuals), Meta (67 individuals), Cinaruco (19 individuals), Portuguesa (12 individuals), Orinoco (five individuals), San Carlos (four individuals), Riecito (three individuals), and Tinaco and Guanare (two individuals each) Rivers (Godshalk 1978, 1982) and 280 from Colombia mainly in departments such as the Arauca (180 individuals), Casanare (49 individuals), Meta (14 individuals). and Vichada (37 individuals; Medem 1981). Current studies show a general reduction in these numbers in both Venezuela (Seijas et al. 2010, Espinosa-Blanco and Seijas 2012, Moreno 2012) and Colombia (Lugo-Rugeles 1996), indicating that the situation of the species is worse than previous reports. Lugo-Rugeles (1996) estimated an overall mature population size of 123 individuals in the Lipa, Cuiloto, Ele, Cravo Norte, Santo Domingo, Duda, Lozada, Alto Guayabero, Meta, and Vichada rivers. Historic estimations (before 1980) regarding mature population sizes were not completed across Orinoco Crocodile range. However, Medem (1981) estimated that between 1920 and 1950 a minimum of 254,000 skins from mature animals were exported.Restocking processes have been highly uneven between Venezuela and Colombia. To date, Venezuela has released into the wild 9,812 individuals in consecutive years between 1990 and 2016 in five states (Apure, Gu√°rico, Barinas, Cojedes, and Portuguesa), with a maximum of 763 individuals released during 2009 and a minimum of 40 during 1990 (Chavez 2002, Babarro 2014). In contrast, even though efforts at restocking in Colombia have not been as vigorous as in Venezuela, it is notable that starting in 2015 two institutions (The Palmarito Foundation and the National University of Colombia) have released a total of 57 individuals in three departments (Casanare, Vichada, and Meta; Antelo 2015, Antelo et al. 2016, Moreno-Arias et al. 2016).",Decreasing,"The Orinoco Crocodile (Crocodylus intermedius) is distributed in the northern part of South America, occurring in both Colombia and Venezuela (Medem 1983). This species has been described as restricted (endemic) to the Orinoco basin, occurring historically from the Lozada-Duda-Guayabero river system in central Colombia to the Orinoco delta in northeastern Venezuela from 0 to 350 m asl (Medem 1981, 1983; Seijas et al. 2010; Balaguera-Reina et al. 2017). Crocodylus intermedius has never been reported in the Amazon basin, with the Paragua and Jao rivers (Orinoco River tributaries) between San Fernando de Atabapo and La Mision de La Esmeralda being the historically southernmost distribution (Humboldt 1805 in Medem 1981, Gorzula and Mendoza 1993). Geographical barriers, especially mountain systems (such as the eastern Andes, the Merida Cordilleras in the west, the Venezuelan coastal range in the north, and the Guiana shield in the southeast), have also delimited the Orinoco crocodile distribution. Historical data suggests that it has never occurred in the Caroni River Basin (Castro and Gorzula 1986). To date, it is still not clear why the species has never colonized the Atabapo and Casiquiare rivers (likely waterways towards the Amazon basin), remaining an interesting question to be resolved (Medem 1981). However, indigenous communities have reported seeing C. intermedius, including breeding events, in the Casiquiare River (Antelo 2008), raising questions about the presence of the species in this area.Currently, the Orinoco Crocodile can be found in a small portion of its historical distribution in large rivers such as Arauca, Bita, Cinaruco, Guaviare, Guayabero, Lozada, Meta, Vichada, Orinoco, Casanare, Cusiana, Ele, Lipa, Cravo Norte, Cravo Sur, Ariporo (Morales-Betancourt et al. 2015, Moreno-Arias et al. 2016, Antelo et al. 2016), Manacacias, Apure, Portuguesa, Tucupido, Cojedes, Manapire, Capanaparo, Ventuari, Caura, Zuata, and some of their tributaries (Gorzula and Mendoza 1993, Arteaga et al. 1996, Antelo 2008, Seijas 2011, Babarro per. comm). Recent studies have identified 34 areas across the Orinoco Crocodile range [16 in Colombia, 16 in Venezuela, and two covering both countries (Meta River - Lower basin and Arauca River), which are the remnants of a much larger distribution (Balaguera-Reina et al. 2017)].","Orinoco Crocodile was heavily hunted in the early and mid 1900s mainly for its skin.

The species is currently protected by national and international laws that prohibit its use of any kind, with the exception of scientific research an zoo interchanges. However, low scale poaching is still reported in some rivers of Venezuela and Colombia mainly because fear or local consumption (meat and eggs).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation programs are ongoing in both Colombia and Venezuela since the 1990s, focused on restocking populations and understanding the ecology of the species to reduce conflict with human populations (Balaguera-Reina et al. 2017). In this regards, Venezuela has released a total of 10,122 individuals in consecutive years between 1990 and 2017 in five states (Apure, Gu√°rico, Barinas, Cojedes, and Portuguesa), with a maximum of 763 individuals released during 2009 and a minimum of 40 during 1990 (Ch√°vez 2002, Babarro 2014, Velasco per. comm). On the other hand, Colombia has released a total of 101 individuals since 2015 in three departments (Casanare, Vichada, and Meta; Antelo 2015, Antelo et al. 2016, Moreno-Arias et al. 2016). However, despite the number of population ecology studies and restocking programs developed during the last two decades in these two countries, reliable information about the status of populations in both Venezuela and Colombia is lacking (Espinosa-Blanco and Seijas 2012, Morales-Betancourt et al. 2015). New efforts to identify relevant areas where research projects are ongoing and populations information allow researchers to define the local status of the species (regional habitat priority/crocodile conservation unit RHP/CCU) as well as areas with low information and no research currently being done (regional research priority RRP) defined a total of 34 critical areas (16 in Colombia, 16 in Venezuela, and two covering both countries), 10 RHP/CCU (six from Venezuela and four from Colombia) and 24 RRP (10 from Venezuela, 12 from Colombia, and two in both countries; Balaguera-Reina et al. 2017). From these, Ca√±o Guaritico (Creek) and the Capanaparo River in Venezuela and the Ele, Lipa, Cravo Norte River System and the Guayabero River in Colombia were defined as areas with the most optimal conditions for long-term preservation and maintenance of Crocodylus intermedius populations.Crocodylus intermedius was listed in Appendix I of CITES at the convention inception and no international trade, legal or illegal, has been reported since.",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

Breeding takes place in the streams, and the larvae are aquatic.","In this species' previous (2004) assessment, habitat loss and degradation due to selective logging and clear-cutting of primary forests and conversion of habitat to wood plantations were highlighted as the major threats. Additional listed threats included alteration of watersheds, sedimentation and pollution of waterbodies (often by livestock, but also from mining waste), predation by introduced trout, and chytridiomycosis was suggested as a potential future threat.&#160;More recently, Barrionuevo and Ponssa (2008) postulate that the local extinction of Telmatobius ceiorum may likely be due to predation by non-native fish (trout). Trout were originally introduced in the R√≠o Los Sosa basin, and in 1984 - the same year that T. ceiorum was last recorded - trout stocking became intense (Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008). Trout are currently found throughout&#160;the species' range (Barrionuevo 2012).

Its clutch size has been documented to vary between 80 and 500 eggs (Pisan√≥ 1955 in Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008), and available data suggest that this species breeds throughout the year (Montero and Pisan√≥ 1990 in Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008).","In this species' previous (2004) assessment, listed threats included predation by introduced exotic fishes (trout), urbanization and the drainage of bogs, alterations of watercourses (through measures such as canalization), degradation of bog habitat by four-wheel drive vehicles, potato cultivation close to the stream edges (increasing sedimentation), overgrazing, construction of roads across the streams, plantation of exotic tree species (pines, with subsequent sedimentation during harvesting), and construction of power-lines in the gorges and within the streams (also resulting in stream sedimentation), with water pollution through mining activities and chytridiomycosis listed as potential future threats.&#160;Chytridiomycosis has been recorded in another species in the genus (T. pisanoi)&#160;ca&#160;60 km airline distance from&#160;the valley of Taf√≠&#160;(Barrionuevo 2012).More recently, Barrionuevo and Ponssa (2008) found that one tadpole collected in 1984 had a mouthpart abnormality, which could be linked to chytrid fungus. These authors suggest that a complex synergistic effect of an abnormally dry and warm period between 1988 and 1993, the presence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in the area, and increased frequency of debris flows may have caused the extinction of this species (Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008).","This species was considered to be abundant in the past, to such an extent that it was used as a study organism for research between the 1940s and 1980s (Lavilla and Barrionuevo 2005, Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008).&#160;It was last recorded in 1993, and exhaustive surveys conducted in 2001‚Äì2005 in suitable habitats and historical and new localities failed to record any individuals (Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008).

Catenazzi pers. comm. January 2011), and has also been reported from Polylepis forests&#160;[R. Guti√©rrez pers. comm. on iNaturalist observation&#160;http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/219132&#160;(Accessed: September 9, 2013)].&#160;At Acjanaco it also occurs in the upper limits of cloud forest. Individuals have been found at night in a small pool, 50 cm deep, on rocks in a stream, and in puna on rocks, in crevices, on the ground, and in moss adjacent to streams. Reproduction is by larval development in streams.","Intense livestock farming, pasture burning and livestock-driven water pollution have been observed in the border area between Megantoni and Manu (R. Guti√©rrez pers. comm. October 2013). Pasture burning and habitat disturbance impact stream riverbeds and increase erosion in certain areas, affecting the formation of breeding pools (R. Guti√©rrez pers. comm.

Chytridiomycosis is therefore considered a severe plausible threat to this species.","This appears to have been a common species in Peru in the 1990s, but more recent observations suggest that it has experienced a drastic population decline in this country. Rangers of Manu National Park frequently found&#160;Telmatobius&#160;frogs (likely&#160;T. timens) at a small spring near the Qurqurpampa station before June 2008 (3,540 m asl, 35 km NNW of Acjanaco), after which the species appears to have suddenly declined&#160;(A.

In 1996 four individuals were found over the course of 12 person/day surveys; in 1998,&#160;two individuals&#160;were found during&#160;18 person/day surveys, and in 2007 and 2008 no individuals were recorded over 25 and 28 person/day surveys, respectively (von May&#160;et al.&#160;2008). In addition, further intensive and targeted surveys conducted between 2009-2010 and 2012-2014 have not shed any new records, either as tadpoles or adults (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. February 2014). However, additional and independent surveys were conducted in 2007 and 2008 in Santuario Nacional Megantoni and the area of Manu National Park adjacent to Megantoni (R. Guti√©rrez pers. comm.

That same year, volunteers at Megantoni found close to 12 individuals at this same site and the Tambo Inca sector of Manu National Park, close to the border with Megantoni. In June 2008, ten 200-metre transects in&#160;the hill streams of&#160;Lorohuachana&#160;were surveyed by one person over an average of 1.5 hours per transect, with a total of two adults and two larvae recorded in this period&#160;[R.

While this suggests that the species may either be more rare at Megantoni or may have experienced a smaller decline than that in Acjanaco,&#160;interviews with park rangers revealed that a park ranger found 16 dead&#160;Telmatobius&#160;frogs (likely&#160;T. timens) at Nuevo Oriente (approximately 50 km NNW of Acjanaco, close to the border with Megantoni) in July 2008 (I.

The species is protected by two conservation units (Superagui and Jacupiranga) in Sao Paolo and Parana states. However, these reserves offer little protection against hunting and collection for pets, and ongoing threats from infrastructure development mean that it is possible the species could decline by at least one-quarter in the next seven years.","Lowland seasonal rain forest of the Atlantic coast of Brazil with rainfall of about 2,000 mm a year, sub-xeromorphic restinga (sandy soil forest), low (8-10 m) inundated forest (caxetais), and secondary forest (Rylands 1993). Golden lion tamarins are an adaptable species well able to live in degraded and secondary forests, depending on sufficient year round food sources and foraging sites, along with the tree holes they use as sleeping sites (see Coimbra-Filho 1969, 1976; Coimbra-Filho and Mittermeier 1973).Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects) (see Rylands 1993; Kierulff et al. 2002a).Kierulff et al. (2002a) provide a comprehensive review of the behavioural ecology of the lion tamarins. They differ from other callithrichids in having long fingers and hands, which allow them to forage for prey efficiently in nooks and crannies and in epiphytic tank bromeliads.Lion tamarins live in extended family groups of usually 4 to 8 individuals. Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. They breed once a year. The groups defend home ranges of 40 to more than 100 ha (the size depending on availability and distribution of foods and second-growth patches). In the Superag√ºi National Park, L. caissara have been found to use very large home ranges (321 ha), travelling from 1,082 to 3,398 m a day (Prado 1999).The first bevioural ecological study of this study of this species was carried out by Prado (Prado and Valladares-Padua 1997; Prado 1999; Prado et al. 2000). French et al. (2002) review the reproductive biology of lion tamarins, Baker et al. (2002) review their mating system and group dynamics (focussing particularly on L. rosalia) and Tardif et al. (2002) aspects of infant care and development.","With a very restricted distribution and few individuals known to exist, this species is perhaps the rarest and most threatened of all the callitrichids, despite the fact that part of the island of Superag√ºi, along with the Ilha de Pe√ßas, was decreed a national park (without knowledge of the existence of the lion tamarins) of 21,400 ha in 1989. The threats to, and conservation strategies for, surviving L. caissara populations have been discussed by C√¢mara (1993, 1994) and Vivekenanda (1994). The main threats come from forest destruction and degradation due to agriculture, squatters, hunting and extractivism, especially for palm hearts, and, most seriously, from burgeoning human occupation through land speculation and tourism (see Vivekananda 2001).A study by Dietz et al. (2000) examined inbreeding depression in small (50 or less) isolated populations of L. rosalia. They concluded that it reduced probability of long-term survival by about one-third. There is every reason to believe that inbreeding depression is likewise prejudicial to the isolated populations of L. caissara, most notably on the mainland.","Lorini and Persson (1994a,b) estimated a total population not exceeding 260 animals, divided into three subpopulations: that on the island of Superag√ºi (about 120 individuals), and two on the adjacent mainland, in the valleys of the Rios Patos and Branco (estimated at 35 individuals), and the valleys of the Rios Varadouro and Ara√ßauba (estimated 100 individuals). As noted already, the northern limits to the range of L. caissara identified by Lorini and Persson (1990) were extended north into the state of S√£o Paulo to the Serra do Cordeiro through the surveys of Martuscelli and Rodrigues (1992), but many localities were based on reports, which have yet to be confirmed (Valladares-Padua et al. 2000). The northernmost confirmed localities to date are those in the region Ariri, municipality of Cananeia (Rodrigues 1998), and Valladares-Padua et al. (2000) indicated that under any circumstances the populations there are extremely scarce. Both Martuscelli and Rodrigues (1992) and Valladares-Padua et al. (2000) found difficulties in surveying the region using interviews as a guide (people knew little or confused the species, felt intimidated, and in some cases were hostile).A more recent population estimate for the Island of Superagui, based on transect work between 2000 and 2002, is 183 animals (Amaral et al. 2003); there are no recent population estimates for the mainland. The total current population is therefore for unlikely to exceed 400 animals at present.Population densities are in the order of 1.5 individuals/km¬≤ or 0.30 groups/km¬≤ (Lorini and Persson 1994a). Amaral et al. (2003) reported an individual density of 1.66 individuals/km¬≤ or 0.38 groups/km¬≤ on Superagui.",Decreasing,"The Black-faced Lion Tamarin occupies the southernmost limits of the distribution of the callitrichids. The type locality is on the north-eastern part the island of Superag√ºi, on the coast of the state of Paran√°. Other groups have been found elsewhere on the island, except in the extreme north and some higher elevations in the south-west (Persson and Lorini 1991, 1993). These authors found L. caissara on the mainland, in parts of the valleys of the Rio Sebu√≠ and the Rio dos Patos, limited in the north by the Rio Varadorzinho, and to the west by the Serra da Utinga, Morro do Bico Torto, Morro do Poruquara, and Serra do Gigante. Persson and Lorini (1991, 1993; Lorini and Persson 1994a,b) estimated that its entire range is less than 300 km¬≤. Four groups have been found to the north, also on the coast, in the municipality of Canan√©ia in the state of S√£o Paulo (Persson and Lorini 1993). Martuscelli and Rodrigues (1992) reported four localities in the extreme south-east of S√£o Paulo, two in the basin of the Rio do Turvo (Rio do Turvo and Morro do Teixeira, localities 1 and 3, map p.922), and two further north in the region of Itapitangui (localities 13 and 14, map, p.922), opposite the Ilha Canan√©ia.

307,South America,Ateles fusciceps,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PRIMATES,MAMMALIA,ATELIDAE,Ateles,fusciceps,A2cd,This species is listed as Critically Endangered due to an estimated population decline of more than 80% over the past 45 years (three generations) due to severe habitat loss and hunting pressure throughout its range.,"In Ecuador (A. f. fusciceps), tropical and subtropical humid forests from 100 to 1,700 m above sea level (Tirira 2007). In Colombia (A. f. rufiventris), Hern√°ndez-Camacho and Cooper (1976) recorded that it occurs in dry forest, humid forest and cloud forest, occupying the greatest range of forest habitats of any of the Colombian spider monkeys. Defler (2004) indicated that they range as high as 2,000-2,500 m above sea level in the Cordilllera Occidental. Spider monkeys travel and forage in the upper levels of the forest. They spend much time in the canopy and also use the middle and lower strata but are rarely seen in the understorey. In accordance with their use of the highest levels of the forest, they are highly suspensory. When travelling they spend more time hanging from branches, moving by brachiation and arm swinging, and climbing than they do walking or running on all fours. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on the mature, soft parts of a very wide variety of fruits, which comprise 83% of their diet and are found mainly in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). They also eat young leaves and flowers (both especially at times of fruit shortage during the beginning of the dry season), and besides such as young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, bark, decaying wood, and honey, and very occasionally small insects such as termites and caterpillars. They play a significant role as seed dispersers. Van Roosmalen (1985; Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988) found that A. paniscus was dispersing the seeds of at least 138 species (93.5% of all fruits species used) through their ingestion and subsequent defecation (endozoochory). A further 10 species were being dispersed by the monkeys carrying them off some distance from the tree before dropping them (exozoochory). In only 23 species were the seeds being ruined or eaten (seed predation).Spider monkeys live in groups of up to 20-30 individuals (for review see Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). However, they are very rarely all seen together, and nearly always to be found travelling, feeding and resting small in groups of varying size and composition (most usually 2-4), the only persistent association being that of a mother and her offspring (McFarland Symington 1990). Group members will also travel on their own. Each female in the group has a ‚Äúcore area‚Äù of the group‚Äôs home range which she uses most. Klein and Klein (1976, 1977) estimated 259-388 ha ranges with 20-30% overlap for A. belzebuth in La Macarena National Park, Colombia. Ateles are rarely seen in association with other primates and mostly they are occasional and ephemeral, resulting from the simultaneous occupation of fruiting trees. Six estimated birth dates given by Klein (1971) for A. belzebuth, were spread throughout the year (December, January, April, September, October and November). Spider monkeys apparently reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age (Klein 1971; Eisenberg 1973, 1976). They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with a minimum theoretical interbirth interval in captivity of 17.5 months, but in the wild probably as long as 28-30 months (Eisenberg 1973, 1976). Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals make it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats.","Ateles fusciceps fuscicepsTirira (2001) has reported an 80% reduction in population size based on habitat loss. This species has a very small distribution, is highly fragmented, and is under pressure from a high rate of habitat loss due to deforestation and strong hunting pressure.Ateles fusciceps rufiventrisIn Colombia, Defler et al. (2003) all spider monkeys are considered threatened due to hunting and habitat loss and fragmentation. National Parks such as Katios and Orquideas are believed to have very few spider monkeys because of indigenous hunting pressure (N. Vargas pers. comm.; H. Rubio pers. comm.) and the population density of Ateles may be decreasing in Los Katios (Director del Parque Los Katios, D. Pintor pers. comm.). Widespread censuses of Ateles are needed, especially in national parks.In Colombia, along the Atlantic coast, it has been estimated that over 30% of habitat has been lost in the past 10 years based on calculations from satellite photos (Miller et al, 2004). Ground truthing of this data found only 2.5% of viable secondary forest habitat was left in this region (Miller et al. 2004). In Panama, there is a lower human population and likely higher habitat availability, but more research is needed to determine population status and threats to this subspecies.","Ateles fusciceps fusciceps is rare and diifficult to see (Madden and Albuja 1989). In Cotacachi-Cayapas, this subspecies is found in population densities of 1.2 individuals/km¬≤ (Gavilanes and Endara 2006).There is no population information available for Ateles fusciceps rufiventris.",Decreasing,"There are two recognized subspecies:Ateles fusciceps fusciceps  is endemic to Ecuador, in the north, west of the Andes, in the Province of Esmeraldas, and, at least historically it would seem, south as far the Cordillera de Colonche (Tirira 2007). There are two populations remaining: one in the Chongon Colonche Mountain Range and the another in the Cotacachi-Cayapas Reserve and surrounding forests in the north. Hern√°ndez-Camacho and Cooper (1976) suggested that A. f. fusciceps might occur in southern Colombia, south of the R√≠o Mira, continuous with the populations in Ecuador, but no evidence has been forthcoming regarding this. Ateles fusciceps rufiventris ranges from the western cordillera of the Andes from south-western Colombia, northward on west side of the R√≠o Cauca to eastern Panama (Cerro Pirre and the basin of the R√≠o Bayano of the Pacific coast) (Rylands et al. 2006).

It occurs in the Urab√° region in north-western Antioquia, C√≥rdoba, Sucre, and northern Bol√≠var east to the lower R√≠o Cauca along the western bank to south-central Antioquia. The most southerly record in Colombia is Barabacoas, Department of Nari√±o, and the most northerly is southern bank of the Canal del Dique, Cartagena. Hern√°ndez-Camacho and Cooper (1976) believed that it formerly occurred as far north as Pendales.Ateles f. rufiventris does not occur in Ecuador and is discontinuous with A. f. fusciceps.

Its generation length is conservatively estimated to be 12 years. Estimated spawning stock biomass has declined approximately 85% over the past 36 years (1973‚Äì2009) and there is no sign that the spawning stock is rebuilding. It is therefore listed as Critically Endangered. Implementation of effective conservation and management measures are urgently needed.,"By maturity, most Southern Bluefin Tuna lead an oceanic, pelagic existence. Spawning fish and larvae are encountered in waters with surface temperatures between 20 and 30¬∞C. This species is an opportunistic feeder, preying on a wide variety of fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods, salps, and other marine animals.Maximum size is 225 cm fork length (FL) and 200 kg. Longevity is 20 or more years. Sex ratio in catches shows that as juveniles, females outnumber males but this situation is reversed in adults. Maturity can occur at 120 cm (FL) but more commonly at 130 cm or about eight years old; size at 50% maturity has also been estimated to be 152 cm (FL) (Collette and Nauen 1983, Thorogood 1986, Caton 1994, Farley and Davis 1998, Schaefer 2001, Collette 2010). Based on the CCSBT (CCSBT 2009, CCSBT 2010), age of first maturity is estimated to be about 10 years and longevity about 40 years. Generation length is therefore very conservatively estimated to be at least 12 years.Spawning is restricted to a relatively small area off northwestern Australia in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean (Nishikawa et al. 1985). The spawning season extends throughout the southern summer from about September or October to March at water surface temperatures in excess of 24¬∞C. Once females start spawning, they appear to spawn daily. The Southern Bluefin is an asynchronous indeterminate spawner with annual batch fecundity 57 oocytes/g body weight. Fecundity of a 158 cm female with gonads weighing about 1.7 kg each was estimated at about 14‚Äì15 million eggs (Thorogood 1986, Caton 1994, Farley and Davis 1998, Schaefer 2001, Collette 2010). It is not known whether all mature fish spawn each year, every few years, or even only once in their lifetime.In Australia, Southern Bluefin Tuna migrate along the west coast and across the Great Australian Bight and around Tasmania to 45¬∞S, and then along the southeastern Australian coastline to about 30¬∞S, off northern New South Wales.The all-tackle game fish record is of a 167.5 kg fish caught off Tatra, Australia in 2009 (IGFA 2011).","This species has been intensively fished since the 1950s, primarily being taken on longlines, and the dramatic decline in the total population of Southern Bluefin Tuna to 7‚Äì15% of the 1960 parental biomass is well documented (FSC 2009). Canning was the most important form of local utilization of this highly esteemed fish until the early 1980s. This species is considered depleted by Majkowski (2007), and seriously overfished by Joseph (2009). If the current exploitation continues, it is estimated that the population will be below 500 mature individuals in 100 years. According the most recent stock assessment, there is no current sign that the spawning stock of this species is rebuilding (CCSBT 2009, CCSBT 2010).","Worldwide reported landings show a gradual, but variable, increase from 13,552 tonnes in 1952 to a high of 55,200 tonnes in 1969, and then gradually decreasing, to 12,122 tonnes in 1991. Catches from 1992 to 2006 have been relatively stable, averaging around 16,0000 tonnes per year (FAO 2009). This species is farmed in Australia, where mostly immature fish (age 2‚Äì4 years) are removed from the wild and fattened in farms. This complicates estimation of catches and is associated with high mortality rates of fish during transport.A stock assessment has been carried out by the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT 2006). Based on the median results of this most recent stock assessment, there has been an estimated 85.4% decline in spawning stock biomass over the past 36 years from 1973 to 2009 (CCSBT 2010).",Decreasing,"This species is found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. It is found in temperate and cold seas, mainly between 30¬∞S and 50¬∞S, to nearly 60¬∞S. During spawning, large fish migrate to tropical seas, off the west coast of Australia, up to 10¬∞S.","This species is an important commercial species, especially off Australia. The meat is highly prized for the sashimi markets of Japan. A specialized fishery for sashimi-quality has been developed recently by New Zealand fishers.",Marine,"This is a highly migratory species, listed in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. Current worldwide catch quota has been reduced to 9,448 tonnes per year (CCSBT 2009). However, the current fishing capacity is much higher than the quota. There are several management measures in place including catch control, vessel monitoring, etc. However, more restrictions may be needed.The CCSBT agreed that the status of the stock is at a critical stage and that a meaningful reduction in the total allowable catch (TAC) is necessary in order to recover the stock and work toward reaching an interim rebuilding target reference point of 20% of the original spawning stock. Consequently, the CCSBT reduced the global total allowable catch (TAC) for 2010 and 2011 to an average level over the two years of 80% of the previously allocated global TAC of 11,810 tonnes. Accordingly, the average global TAC for each of the 2010 and 2011 fishing seasons will be 9,449 tonnes. The CCSBT has adopted a number of conservation measures including requirements for fleets to monitor and submit data to show compliance with TACs, development of scientific observer programs, monitoring of farming operations and port inspection of catches. The CCSBT has also implemented a Trade Information Scheme to collect more accurate and comprehensive data on Southern Bluefin Tuna fishing by monitoring trade and illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing.",,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

344,South America,Plecturocebus oenanthe,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PRIMATES,MAMMALIA,PITHECIIDAE,Plecturocebus,oenanthe,A2cd,Listed as Critically Endangered as it is estimated that a population reduction of &#160;‚â•80% has occurred over the last 25 years due to massive deforestation of this species' preferred habitat as a result of increased human population pressure and intensification of agricultural activities and a lack of concrete conservation activities .,"This species is known to occur in low secondary forests and remnant forest and has been seen in bamboo stands, viney thickets, fruit crops and palm-dominated semi-flooded forests (‚Äúaguajales‚Äù and ‚Äúrenacales‚Äù) (DeLuycker 2006, 2007). Mark (2003) noted that occurrence records (both sightings and calls) were frequently located near rivers and streams (distance of et al. (2009), also found the species in forests located far away from rivers and claim that the&#160; species does not seem to be bound to a specific habitat,&#160; and confirmed their presence in inundated areas with aguajales (Mauritia flexuosa) and renacales (Ficus trigona), but also drier zones with oj√©s (Ficus anthelmintica), tangaranas (Triplaris sp.), zapotes (Ponteria mimosa), and ceticos (Cecropia sp.).These Titi Monkeys appear to be able to survive (at least in the short term in the absence of hunting) in forest fragments and relatively large groups have been registered in fragments of  Callicebus oenanthe occurs in the same region as another threatened primate, Oreonax flavicauda. The former occupies the valleys to the south-east of the distribution of O. flavicauda and there no known area of sympatry. Oreonax flavicauda is only present above 1,500 m (A. DeLuycker and J. Vermeer pers. comm.) in the mountains bordering the range of C. oenanthe; the same is probably true for Aotus miconax (J. Vermeer pers. comm.).   Titi Monkeys are known to be monogamous and live in small family groups. In the first long-term study of C. oenanthe (undertaken in an isolated fragment), a group of five monkeys (an adult male and female and their three offspring) used an area of 2.5 ha (DeLuycker 2007). This group‚Äôs diet consisted mainly of insects (45%) and fruits (39%), although young seeds, flowers and non-reproductive plant parts such as leaves, shoots and tendrils and new meristem were also eaten (DeLuycker 2007). Liana species were particularly important in the diet, as were fruits from stem-parasitic plants from the mistletoe family, and the group spent a considerable amount of time foraging for insects (DeLuycker 2006). In contrast with Titi Monkeys at other sites, the group used only three sleeping sites during the entire study. They shared the fragment with saddleback tamarins [Saguinus fuscicollis leucogenys] (DeLuycker 2006).","The main threats to this species are habitat loss and fragmentation, and hunting pressure. The region has suffered intense human colonization over the last 30 years because of a major agrarian programme, which has attracted huge numbers of immigrants. Agricultural activities include the cultivation of rice and coffee; cattle ranching and selective timber extraction also occur. The region is characterized by rapid rates of deforestation (estimates vary from 40,000 to 100,000 ha per year) and fragmentation, and has lost at least 40% of its forest cover, mainly from the low-altitude river basins (the preferred habitat of this species) over the last 20 years (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006). The construction of a two-lane all-weather road, which was asphalted in 2003 - La Carretera Marginal, Via Marginal, or Carretera Fernando Belaunde Terry - which runs all the way to the coast (Chiclayo) and past Tarapoto has contributed to the influx of immigrants and a change from subsistence to small-scale farming. It has also altered the spatial distribution of human settlers, who now follow the highway far into the valley and high forests, and the lack planning or state-regulated land occupation and use puts protected areas and remaining forests at risk (DeLuycker 2006).  The species is not found in any large protected areas of San Martin. Recent studies (B√≥veda-Penalba et al. 2009) determined that an estimated 60% of the species original range has already been lost, and its current range comprises only small fragments of secondary forest. All groups encountered live in small highly degraded remnants of forest, isolated from other populations. The species is being hunted for its meat, both the Aguarunas and recent immigrants hunt this species (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006, B√≥veda-Penalba et al. 2009). While Titis Monkeys may not be a particularly lucrative source of protein, hunting pressure is likely to increase as preferred game become scarce and fragmentation facilitates access. These Titi Monkeys are popular as pets (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006, B√≥veda-Penalba et al. 2009) and have been found for sale at markets (Rowe and Martinez 2003, Mark 2003) and encountered along with Aotus miconax at tourist centres in the upper Mayo valley (Mark 2003).","A few short surveys were undertaken (Rowe and Martinez 2003, Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006) and interviews conducted with communities of Aguaruna Amerindians to confirm the presence or absence of the species in different parts of its range. Aldrich (2006) undertook a song-based survey of a population at Tarangue (a 74 ha private reserve near Moyobamba) and estimated a population density of 1.4 individuals per ha. Group sizes were unusually large for Titi Monkeys, with 20% of groups containing six to eight individuals. Rowe and Martinez (2003) carried out a four-day survey, and although they did not observe the species in the wild, they heard several groups of Titi Monkeys (presumed to be C. oenanthe) vocalizing in a forest remnant at 925 m. They photographed a family being sold at a local market that had been captured near Rioja. Mark (2003) carried out surveys at five sites and observed monkeys in fragments as small as 2 ha (804 m asl).",Decreasing,"Until 2007, this species was thought to be endemic to the upper Rio Mayo valley or Alto Mayo (Hershkovitz 1990). However, a recent study by B√≥veda-Penalba et al. 2009, undertaken over six months at 96 localities, revealed that its distribution extends much further to the south of the Department of San Martin, extending into the Bajo Mayo and Huallaga Central, almost reaching the Rio Huallabamba (known locally as the rio Huayabamba). This area is heavily deforested, and to date only one area was found where a viable population might live, although further research is needed to confirm this. Mark (2003) and DeLuycker (2006) suggested that the species‚Äô altitudinal range may be restricted to below 1,000 m. The study undertaken by B√≥veda-Penalba et al. (2009) registered the species between 252 and 1,053 metres asl. Results from research undertaken in the Proyecto Mono Toc√≥n show that at least 60% of the species‚Äô original habitat has already been lost.  There is an urgent need for additional surveys of all potential habitats in San Martin, and larger tracts of forest. Mark (2003) notes that subpopulations near the banks of the Rio Mayo differ in colour from those in the Aguaruna territory in the north-east. DeLuycker (2006) reported a marked difference in pelage colour between a group she studied in a fragment near Moyobamba and those photographed by Noel Rowe. During surveys, attention should be given to the distributions of the different colour morphs (Mark 2003). B√≥veda-Penalba et al. (2009) detected little difference in colour in individuals of the Alto Mayo, they argue that pelage colour varies depending on the lighting conditions. Some darker animals appeared much lighter when their bodies were turned in a different direction, making it difficult to determine differences in colour between Alto Mayo populations and the same was true for the quantity of white hair on the face. However, animals in the southern part of San Martin appear to be somewhat greyer than animals near Alto Mayo and usually do not have a a white mask (Tello-Alvarado J. C. pers comm). B√≥veda-Penalba et al. (2009) claim that the species lives in sympatry with another, undescribed species of Callicebus in the southern part of its range. Recent research carried out by the same team suggests it is just a morphological variation of C. oenanthe (A.J. B√≥veda-Penalba pers. comm). ","It is locally hunted for food, and animals are taken as pets.",Terrestrial,"Very little attention has been given to forest conservation in this region. This species‚Äô range may include the Bosque de Protecci√≥n de Alto Mayo, which extends from the town of Rioja north along the border between the departments of San Mart√≠n and Amazonas, however more surveys are needed to confirm this as there species was registered once in a buffer zone of this protected area. During short surveys of the Reserve, no titis were detected in the high-altitude areas which make up most of the reserve. It is likely that the species only occurs in the low-altitude areas on the edges of the reserve (&lt;1%) (Rowe and Martinez 2003, DeLuycker 2006). Other protected areas in this species‚Äô range include, Tarangue (74 ha), which belongs to a conservation organization called IKAMA Peru. The species also occurs in the Pabloyacu Reserve (640 ha) of the Universidad de San Mart√≠n, but despite its name this is not a protected area. Mark (2003) and DeLuycker (2006) have emphasized the potential importance of both privately owned reserves and Amerindian reservations for the long-term conservation of this species. There are 14 indigenous Aguaruna communities located throughout the Alto Mayo region. The large tracts of forested land allocated to these well-organized communities could play a key role in conservation initiatives (Mark 2003).   A team of scientists from NatureServe, Conservation Data Center - Peru/UNALM, and the Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonia Peruana (IIAP) have recently completed part of a a project financed by the Moore foundation ‚ÄúEndemic Species and Ecological Systems of the Eastern Andean Slope and the Amazon Basin in Peru and Bolivia‚Äù. The objectives were to develop conservation baseline maps for the Andes-Amazon regions of Peru and Bolivia to inform planning and effective conservation action at regional and local scales and build local and regional capacity for developing and using biodiversity information. ( see at http://www.natureserve.org/aboutUs/latinamerica/andes_amazon.jsp) Together with regional leaders the project identified sustainable ways to regulate land use while also protecting the region‚Äôs natural species and habitats. Biodiversity information generated by the project was analysed together with existing land use data to identify areas of high conservation concern and develop scenarios of land uses for agriculture, infrastructure and forestry that have lower impact and help support biodiversity conservation. Proyecto Mono Toc√≥n, started in 2007 as an initiative of Le Conservatoire pour la Protection des Primates, French foundation created by the park primates La Vall√©e des Singes. The main objective of this project is the conservation of San Martin Titi Monkey (C. oenanthe) and its habitat. This local NGO has launched a long-term project which has three well-defined lines of work: Conservation, Research and Environmental Education. The Proyecto Mono Toc√≥n works directly with local people, local governments and other NGOs in establishing community conservation areas.

345,South America,Ateles hybridus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PRIMATES,MAMMALIA,ATELIDAE,Ateles,hybridus,A2cd+3cd,"Listed as Critically Endangered as there is reason to believe the species has declined by at least 80% over the past 45 years (three generations) due primarily to hunting and habitat loss. Over the coming 45 years, this decline is likely to reach similar proportions due to continuing habitat loss.","In Venezuela, Ateles hybridus hybridus inhabits mainly the high and lowland primary evergreen rainforests from 20 to 700 m asl. Spider monkeys travel and forage in the upper levels of the forest. They spend much time in the canopy and also use the middle and lower strata but are rarely seen in the understorey. In accordance with their use of the highest levels of the forest, they are highly suspensory. When travelling they spend more time hanging from branches, moving by brachiation and arm swinging, and climbing than they do walking or running on all fours. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on the mature, soft parts of a very wide variety of fruits, which comprise 83% of their diet and are found mainly in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). They also eat young leaves and flowers (both especially at times of fruit shortage during the beginning of the dry season), and besides such as young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, bark, decaying wood, and honey, and very occasionally small insects such as termites and caterpillars. They play a significant role as seed dispersers. Van Roosmalen (1985; Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988) found that A. paniscus was dispersing the seeds of at least 138 species (93.5% of all fruits species used) through their ingestion and subsequent defecation (endozoochory). A further 10 species were being dispersed by the monkeys carrying them off some distance from the tree before dropping them (exozoochory). In only 23 species were the seeds being ruined or eaten (seed predation).Spider monkeys live in groups of up to 20-30 individuals (for review see Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). However, they are very rarely all seen together, and nearly always to be found travelling, feeding and resting small in groups of varying size and composition, the only persistent association being that of a mother and her offspring (McFarland Symington 1990). Group members will also travel on their own. Each female in the group has a ‚Äúcore area‚Äù of the group‚Äôs home range which she uses most. Klein and Klein (1976, 1977) estimated 259-388 ha ranges with 20-30% overlap for A. belzebuth in La Macarena National Park, Colombia. Ateles are rarely seen in association with other primates and mostly they are occasional and ephemeral, resulting from the simultaneous occupation of fruiting trees.Six estimated birth dates given by Klein (1971) for the closely related A. belzebuth, were spread throughout the year (December, January, April, September, October and November). Spider monkeys apparently reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age (Klein 1971; Eisenberg 1973, 1976). They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with a minimum theoretical interbirth interval in captivity of 17.5 months, but in the wild probably as long as 28-30 months (Eisenberg 1973, 1976).Congdon (1996) provided a brief remark on the behaviour of these monkeys at the Reserva Forestal Caparo, and Duque (2007) provided a list of potential feeding trees for Ateles hybridus hybridus in the El √Åvila National Park (however, this primate species was not observed at the time of Duque¬¥s survey). Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals makes it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats.SizeAdult male weight 7.9-8.6 kg (mean 8.25 kg, n=2) (see Di Fiore and Campbell 2007Adult female weight 7.5-10.5 kg (mean 9.1 kg, n=7) (see Di Fiore and Campbell 2007).","In Colombia, both Ateles hybridus hybridus and Ateles hybridus brunneus are subject to habitat loss and to hunting. The habitat of A. h. hybridus is extremely fragmented, and there may be few populations of an adequate size to be viable in the mid- to long-term (Defler et al. 2003). Habitat alteration appears to be the most important threat to the Venezuelan population of A. h. hybridus. The lowland forest of the state of Zulia and the piedmond of the Perij√° Mountains are heavily destroyed from expanding cattle-ranching activities (B. Urbani, unpubl.). Portillo and Vel√°squez (2006) undertook a gap analysis for this primate species within the Perij√° Mountains and found that, while the total forest extent is still very large (813,257 ha), only 30% is relatively well preserved and protected. The rest remains affected by rapid human expansion and land clearance. Also in the Perij√° Mountains, these monkeys seem to be favourite game animals (Lizarralde 2002). In central Venezuela, some areas that were reported with these monkeys (Cordero-Rodr√≠guez and Biord 2001) were resurveyed by Duque (2007) without reports of any sightings; most of the area is already converted to secondary vegetation. Also in this region, B. Urbani (unpubl.) found that buffer areas around the protected areas‚Äîwith confirmed populations of Ateles hybridus hybridus (P. N. Guatopo) and unconfirmed populations (M. N. Cueva Alfredo Jahn, P. N. Henry Pittier, P. N. San Esteban and P. N. El √Åvila)‚Äîare transformed into cleared areas for slash-and-burn agriculture and human settlements as well as secondary forests. The lowland forest from the eastern part of the Andean Mountains, which are San Camilo and Ticoporo, are under severe pressure from logging.","In Colombia, Bernstein et al. (1976a) calculated a density of 9-14 individuals/km¬≤ for Ateles hybridus hybridus in the San Lucas mountains. Green (1978) calculated densities of 8.2-9.6 groups/km¬≤ at his study site, which if multiplied by his average group size (3.3 individuals) seems to suggest higher densities at his Cerro Bran site when compared with the other study site.There is no reliable population information available for Venezuela (B. Urbani pers. comm.).",Decreasing,"In Colombia, Ateles hybridus hybridus is found from the right bank of the R√≠o Magdalena in the Departments of Magdalena, C√©sar (northward to the southern slopes of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta), the south-western portions of Guajira in the northernmost parts of the Serran√≠a de Perij√°, and in the middle R√≠o Magdalena valley at least to the Departments of Caldas and Cundinamarca. There are also two populations of this subspecies on the slopes of the Cordillera Oriental of the Andes on the Venezuelan border: one population is found in the R√≠o Catatumbo watershed in the Department of Norte de Santander and the other population is found in the north-east piedmont forest of the Department of Arauca (Hern√°ndez-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Defler 2003, 2004). The subspecies has a disrupted distribution in Venezuela (Mondolfi and Eisenberg 1979). It is located in the north, along the south-eastern part of the Central Mountain Range (Cordillera de la Costa) in the state of Miranda, and probably the state of Vargas. It is also located on both sides of the Venezuelan Andean Mountains (states of Zulia, T√°chira, M√©rida, Trujillo, Portuguesa, Apure and Barinas). In its eastern part, this primate is distributed on the piedmont forest and in the highly threatened lowland forests of San Camilo and Ticoporo. On the western side, it is also distributed in the piedmont of the Andes throughout the lowland areas of southern Lake Maracaibo to the Perij√° Mountains (Sierra de Perij√°) along the border with Colombia (Bodini and P√©rez-Hern√°ndez 1987; Linares 1998; Cordero-Rodr√≠guez and Biord 2001; Portillo and Vel√°squez 2006; Duque 2007; B. Urbani, unpubl.).In Colombia, Ateles hybridus brunneus is found between the lower Cauca and Magdalena Rivers in the Department of Bol√≠var, Antioquia and Caldas. This population has sometimes been included with A. h. hybridus, but is here considered distinct.",,Terrestrial,"Ateles hybridus hybridus is found in several protected areas in Colombia, including: Catatumbo-Bari National Natural Reserve (158,125 ha); Tam√° National Natural Park (48,000 ha); El Cocoy National Natural Park (306,000 ha); andParque Nacional Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (383,000 ha) (Defler 2004). They may also occur in Chingaza Natural National Park (50,374 ha). In Venezuela, the species occurs in the Guatopo National Park (92,640 ha), which is of particular importance because it is one the major water reservoirs for the capital city, Caracas. The Sierra de Perij√° National Park (295,288 ha) is the other major protected area with brown spider monkeys. In these national parks, enforcement against hunting and wood extraction is needed. There are no NGOs working actively with Ateles hybridus hybridus as target species, and governmental agencies should improve their conservation efforts. However, there is interest for continuing with surveys on these primates especially in central Venezuela as well as an awareness programme particularly at a local level. It is also fundamental to increase the number of park rangers and improving their economical condition. They also occur in Caparo Forest Reserve (Venezuela) (B. Urbani pers. comm.). Bernstein et al. (1976a) showed the effect of forest disturbance, especially on A. h. brunneus (and Lagothrix lugens), and (1976b) made a plea for the establishment of reserves for this and other threatened primate taxa. Fortunately, the Serran√≠a de San Lucas in southern Bol√≠var still contains extensive forest which has been identified as a possible national park site. The establishment of a San Lucas National Park ought to have high priority in Colombia, since it would preserve many elements of the Nech√≠ refugium, including Saguinus leucopus and Lagothrix lugens. However, the presence of political insurgents, the military and some mine fields make the region very difficult for work and for the presence of the government. The Cienaga de Barbacoas represents another priority area for consideration for the creation of a protected area.Censuses are required for a better understanding of the status of Ateles hybridus, and local populations need to be clearly identified and actively managed, something that is not taking place even in the protected areas where A. h. hybridus is known to occur.This species is listed on Appendix II of CITES.",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

They have also been recorded in gallery and Mauritia palm forest odf the eastern plains of Colombia as well as in seasonally flooded forest (Hern√°ndez-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Klein and Klein 1976; Moynihan 1976). Studying a group of L. lugens in the Tinigua National Park, Colombia, Stevenson et al. (1994) observed a preference for mature forest (82% of the group's time spent there) over open, degraded forest (11%) and flooded forest (5%).In 1967, Klein and Klein (1976) made some observations on the habitat and distribution of this species in La Macarena Natural National Park, Colombia, and Bernstein et al. (1976a) and Kavanagh and Dresdale (1975) made a brief study of its behaviour in a patch of cloud forest in the Serrania de San Lucas, Bol√≠var, Colombia. Woolly monkeys are frugivores, eating also young leaves, leaf buds, flowers, nectar and bark (Ramirez 1980). Stevenson et al. (1994) reviewed observations on group sizes in the Tinigua National Park. Seven groups observed during the late 1980s and early 1990s ranged in size from 14 to about 33. One of the groups (17 individuals: 4 adult males, 5 adult females, 1 subadult male, 1 subadult female, 2 infant males and 2 infant females) ranged over 169 ha.Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals (typically around 3 years) makes it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats. Females begin mating at 5 or 6 years of age, when they leave their natal groups, but do not conceive until 1.5-3 years later (Nishimura et al. 1992).","The major threats are hunting for food (mainly subsistence) and habitat loss due agricultural development/expansion. Habitat loss is also taking place due to clearance of forest for coca plantations, accompanied by fumigation of coca plantations that results in defoliation of contiguous forests. Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals (typically around 3 years) makes it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats.",Occurs at densities of up to 50 individuals/km¬≤ in protected areas (P.

More common through the piedmont of the Uribe region (between La Macarena and the Cordillera Oriental and in the Serrania La Macarena). It extends north to the along the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Oriental to about 3,000 m. In Central Colombia, L. lugens extends from the upper Magdalena valley to at least southern Tolima, west of the of the R√≠o Magdalena and historically at least to the southern part of the Department of Cesar, on the west side of the Cordillera. It is almost certainly extinct there today. There is an isolated enclave in the Serrania de San Lucas in south-eastern Bolivar and northern Antioquia at the northern end of the Central Cordillera. The San Lucas population, studied briefly by Kavanagh and Dresdale, 1975), may have been connected to the populations of the upper Magdalena valley when there was forest there.

Cattle ranching, agriculture and continuing urbanisation are the main threats. The area is characterized by rapid development facilitated by an extensive network of highways. Other threats include potential dangers from roads and power-lines and predation by domestic pets. This species occurs in small fragmented populations that are exposed to synergistic genetic and demographic risks. Hunting pressure needs to be ascertained, but it is probably moderate due to the small body size. During surveys, a few individuals were found being kept as pets (Printes et al. in prep).",The estimated minimum population is 260 individuals (Printes 2007).,Decreasing,"Endemic to Brazil, the Blond Titi Monkey occurs in the states of Bahia (Hershkovitz 1990) and Sergipe at approximately 240-900 m asl (Printes 2007) from the Rio Paragua√ßu river basin to the border between the states of Bahia and Sergipe along the margins of the Rio Real. Prior to the survey of Printes (2005, 2007), this species was known from only four localities: Lamar√£o (type locality), Formosa, Bandeira de Melo and Miror√≥s in the municipality of Ibipeba all in the State of Bahia (Hershkovitz 1990; Marinho-Filho and Ver√≠ssimo 1997). However, the taxon has now been confirmed at over 55 sites in Bahia and Sergipe (Printes 2007; Estrela et al. 2007). In recent surveys (195 km) undertaken in Lamar√£o in Bahia, the species was registered in four locations, all caatinga scrubland fragments (Estrela et al. 2007), some considerably smaller than previously estimated (A. Estrela pers. comm.). In the past, the coastal forests of the ‚ÄòAgreste‚Äô in eastern Bahia probably supported large populations; however, this type of vegetation is rare today (Printes et al. in prep.). Populations have been located in three main regions: Agreste, Lamar√£o and north of the Chapada Diamantina. No titis were recorded in the region west of Araci and Nova Soure, which is dominated by the Cerrado. However, C. barbarabrownae was recorded in the Caatinga of the moister uplands northeast of Araci (Mandacaru, Mirandela and Serra Branca). The species was also recorded in Caatinga habitat further north as far as the Salitre river, 170 km from Juazeiro, but titis were not recorded west of the Chapada Diamantina (Printes 2007; Printes et al. in prep.)Callicebus melanochir replaces C. barbarabrownae in the region known as the ‚ÄòRec√¥ncavo Baiano‚Äô (south of the Paragua√ßu river in the municipality of Igrapiuna). The lower Paragua√ßu forms the limit between the geographic ranges of C. coimbrai, restricted to the left or north bank, and C. melanochir, found on the right bank. Further west, in the region of Feira de Santana, C. barbarabrownae occurs on both banks of the Paragua√ßu. There appears to be no physical barrier between the eastern limit of the range of C. barbarabrownae and the western limit of C. coimbrai (Printes et al. in prep.).

This trend is likely to continue into the next 30 years, and may be compounded by hunting.","Endemic to the fluvial plain of eastern Amazonia, where predominantly found at low altitudes in tall terra firme rain forests; it has also been observed in secondary forests and on rare occasions in mangroves (Silva Jr. 1991; Lopes 1993). Recent field studies (Ferrari et al. 1999b; Port-Carvalho and Ferrari 2002; Santo 2002; Silva 2003; Veiga 2006) have demonstrated that this taxon is able to survive and reproduce (in the absence of hunting), in fragments much smaller than previously thought possible. Small groups have been found in fragments and on islands of less than 20 ha, some of which have been isolated for over 20 years. They are relatively abundant in tracts of forest of between 100 and 1,000 ha, suggesting a degree of tolerance to anthropogenic habitat disturbance and behavioural flexibility in the face of change. Groups with 4 to 39 individuals have been recorded in fragmented habitats (Ferrari et al. 1999; Port-Carvalho and Ferrari 2002, 2004; Santos 2002; Silva 2003; Veiga 2006). The species is a highly frugivorous and is a specialist seed predator: immature seeds can represent as much as 90% of their diet in certain months. Other important plant resources are fruit pulp and flowers. Small quantities of pith, shoots and young leaves are also eaten, as well as a range of arthropods including caterpillars, termites, ants and spiders (Veiga and Ferrari 2006). One means by which some groups coped with extreme fragmentation is by increasing the proportion of flowers and non-reproductive plant parts in the diet (Santos 2002; Silva 2003; Veiga 2006). The home range of a group (39 members) residing in a forest fragment (1,300 ha) over a period of 12 months was 98.6 ha (Veiga 2006). No studies have been undertaken in areas of continuous forest, but it is likely that groups would range over much larger areas, probably covering several hundred hectares; a group of Chiropotes albinasus was recorded using an area in excess of 1,000 ha over an 11-month period (Pinto 2008).","The greatest risks for the future survival of the Black Bearded Saki are the loss and fragmentation of its habitat and hunting pressure. It has the smallest range of the genus, which coincides with the most densely populated part of Brazilian Amazonia, a region with a long tradition of colonization, and which now has deforestation levels that begin to rival those of the Atlantic Forest. Over the last few decades, the establishment of highways, implantation of the Tucuru√≠ hydroelectric dam, logging, and agricultural and ranching activities have lead to widespread devastation of forested areas in this region. The proliferation of secondary roads has further exacerbated this process. Chiropotes satanas is already locally extinct in a large part of its original range and what remains is extremely fragmented and under constant deforestation pressure. Despite not being particularly lucrative or an easy target, this species is also hunted for its meat and fur. Habitat fragmentation processes are probably increasing hunting pressure on this species by providing easier access and through the loss of preferred game. Although this species is more tolerant of habitat fragmentation than previously thought, this should not be considered a motive for complacency with regard to the importance of the implementation of conservation measures, particularly the establishment and adequate control of protected areas. In addition, small populations living in isolated fragments with few opportunities for dispersal are probably not genetically viable in the long-term. There is an obvious need for some management of metapopulations.","From studies using standardized line transects, population densities and sightings/10 km, have been calculated for the a number of areas (see table 1). Density varies depending on the differing influences of hunting pressure and habitat disturbance, but appears to be greater in smaller fragments with lower levels of hunting pressure.",Decreasing,"Endemic to eastern Amazonia in Brazil, this species has a restricted range between the right bank of the rio Tocantins and the eastern limits of the Amazon forest in the Brazilian states of Par√° and Maranh√£o. Although it resides in terra firme forests, its distribution extends as far as the coastal (mangrove) forests and forested areas in the transitional zone between Amazon Forest and Cerrado (savanna) at the southern and eastern borders of its distribution. The most southerly record is at -06 31' 59'' -47 27'00'' in Estreito, Maranh√£o State (Hershkovitz 1985; Silva Jr. 1991; Lopes 1993).",,Terrestrial,"It is listed on CITES Appendix II.The primary federal protected area within this region is the Gurupi Biological Reserve (REBIO Gurupi) in Maranh√£o State (original area 341,650 ha). Together with contiguous Amerindian reservations, it forms a nucleus of continuous forest covering an estimated one million hectares. Despite its potential importance for the conservation of Chiropotes satanas (and the threatened Cebus kaapori), this area suffers intense pressure from local ranchers, timber companies and illegal land settlers, and almost one-third of the Gurupi Reserve's forest has already been lost. The following state protected areas occur within the range of this species, although their presence within all these areas has not been confirmed: Par√° state - APA Lago de Tucuru√≠ - margem direita (568,667 ha); Maranh√£o state - APA do Maracan√£ (18,131 ha), APA da Baixada Maranhense (1,775,035 ha), APA das Reentr√¢ncias Maranhenses (2,680,911 ha), APA Upaon-A√ßu/Miritiba/Alto Pregui√ßa (1,535,310). They may also occur in the following extractive and forest reserves (Maranh√£o): RESEX do Ciriaco (7,550 ha), RESEX do Quilombo do Frechal (9,542 ha) RESEX Mata Grande (10,450 ha), and Reserva Florestal de Buriticupu (9,454 ha) (Veiga et al. in press).The Primate Protection Centre (Centro de Prote√ß√£o de Primatas Brasileiros: ICM/CPB), of the Federal Environmental Protection Institute (Instituto Chico Mendes), supports and coordinates primate conservation programmes throughout Brazil. ICM/CPB together with local has been working towards the resolution of some of the key problems in the REBIO Gurupi but a large-scale operation and continuous monitoring are required to ensure its effective protection. An international committee (Comit√™ Internacional para Conserva√ß√£o e Manejo dos Primatas Amaz√¥nicos) was established by the Chico Mendes Institute (ICM) in conjunction with the the CPB to discuss and define the conservation of Amazonian primate taxa, and together with members of the Pitheciine Action Group (PAG) are developing a Conservation Action Plan for the Black Bearded Saki. Surveys are needed to identify remaining populations both in protected reserves and other areas. The CPB implemented ""Projeto Kaapori"" for the Cebus kaapori and have undertaken surveys and conducted interviews with local people in the central-north, north and west of Maranh√£o. They collected data on all primate species including C. satanas, which will be used in the development of the Action Plan. Given the current situation of the REBIO Gurupi and the lack of other federal protected areas, both privately owned reserves and Amerindian reservations are becoming increasingly important for the long-term conservation of Chiropotes satanas (Ferrari et al. 1999). Research on the effects of fragmentation on isolated populations is also key if we are to be able to evaluate the long-term chances of survival and manage the remaining populations. As the range of C. satanas coincides largely with that of Cebus kaapori, joint research and conservative initiatives can be planned to benefit both species.",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

363,South America,Mustelus fasciatus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CARCHARHINIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,TRIAKIDAE,Mustelus,fasciatus,A2abd+3bd+4abd,"This species is endemic to a restricted area of the inner continental shelf (South Brazil to Argentina) in the Southwest Atlantic ocean. In southern Brazil fishing is intense in the habitat of this demersal shark. CPUE is not available because the species is landed with others as ""unidentified shark"". Gravid females migrate to shallow inshore waters to give birth in October-December. The small juveniles remain in this area, known to be the nursery grounds for this species. The fishery in this area catches the gravid females and small juveniles. During the 1980s, neonates were caught in large numbers in gillnets set off the beach during summer (10-100 per set), but by 2003 are caught only sporadically. This is clear evidence that the species is nearing extinction in Brazilian waters. In the coastal region of the Bonaerensean District of northern Argentina and Uruguay, the biomass of the species, as measured by trawl surveys, decreased by 96% between 1994 and 1999. Fishing for more abundant species is still intense across this species' limited distribution, and observed declines are significant to warrant a Critically Endangered assessment. There is serious concern regarding further declines in the absence of conservation and enforced management measures.","In southern Brazil, the species occurs all year round over smooth bottom of the inner continental shelf at depths down to 250 m, being classified as a non-migratory permanent resident of the area, but the adult females carry out a seasonal inshore-offshore migration. The gravid females stay at depths greater than 20 m during most of the year but migrate to shallow inshore waters in spring. Neonates and small juveniles stay in these waters, which constitute the nursery area of the species (Vooren 1997, Vasconcellos and Vooren 1991, Soto 2001). Pupping occurs in October-December. The presence of large-yolked eggs in the ovary of females with near term pups indicates a yearly reproductive cycle with a gestation period of 11 to 12 months (Soto 2001).  Population parameters are as follows: Size at maturity: 111.5 cm total length (TL) (females); 120 cm TL (males) (Soto 2001) Maximum size: Males 147 cm TL (males); 158 cm TL (females) Size at birth: 39 to 43 cm TL (Vasconcellos and Vooren 1991); 35 cm TL (Soto 2001)  The species feeds mostly on shrimps and crabs (Vooren 1997, Soto 2001).","Intensive demersal fisheries exist over the entire area of distribution of this species, already naturally low in density (as evidenced from catches typically of the order of one to ten specimens per one-hour trawl haul in 1980 when the species was still relatively unexploited (Vooren, unpubl. data)).  In southern Brazil fishing is intense in the habitat of this demersal shark (Miranda and Vooren 1999). The major threat to the species is intensive fishing by pair trawl, shrimp trawl, gillnet and beach seine in the coastal nursery area of the species at depths less than 10 m. The species is caught as bycatch in the shrimp fishery and in the multi-species fishery aimed mostly at an assembly of sciaenid fishes, flounders, mullets, angel sharks and guitarfish (Haimovici and Mendon√ßa 1996, Vooren and Lam√≥naca, unpubl. data). The fishery in the nursery area catches gravid females during their inshore migration in spring and the small juveniles all year round. In gillnets set off the beach during summer, neonates used to be caught in large numbers (10-100 per set) in the 1980s but were caught only sporadically and in much smaller numbers in 2003 (Vooren and Lam√≥naca, unpubl. data). The coastal fishery is driving the species towards extinction through recruitment overfishing.  In Uruguay, where it is not targeted but taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries, species-specific catch data are not available. Together with M. schmitti, which is the main species taken, estimated capture for the period 2000-2002 was 900 tonnes per year (Domingo, pers. comm.).  In the coastal region of the Bonaerensean District of northern Argentina and Uruguay the biomass of the species, as measured by trawl surveys, decreased by 96% between 1994 and 1999 (Massa and Hozbor, unpubl. data).",,Decreasing,"This endemic Southwest Atlantic species occurs at low densities over a restricted area (1,500 km of coastline). In Brazil the species occurs only in the extreme south, between latitudes of approximately 29¬∞S and 34¬∞S. The range extends southward to around 35¬∞30'S in Argentina. Nursery area and birth of young occur only on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, at latitudes from approximately 29 to 34¬∞S and into northern Uruguay (Soto 2001), which is a considerable portion of the species' distribution.",,Marine,"In Brazil, trawl fishing at distances less than three nautical miles from shore (which means at depths of less than about 10 m) is forbidden by law but enforcement of this law meets with practical difficulties, and trawling in the nursery area proceeds almost without restriction. Gillnetting in the nursery area proceeds without legal restrictions. Due to the multi-species nature of the fisheries, regulation measures aimed at a particular species are a difficult proposition. The best solution would be to establish two or three large coastal protected areas in which fishing would be banned, as recommended by Musick et al. (2000) for long-lived marine species threatened by capture as bycatch in fisheries targeting other species. Several other species of elasmobranchs have their nursery and pupping ground in the same shallow coastal waters and would also benefit from this. Public awareness of the problem is increasing. By Decree of the State Government of Rio Grande do Sul, Mustelus fasciatus was, in the year 2002, classified as a species threatened with extinction (Marques 2002).",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

The species is also affected by introduced taxa and contaminants (spraying of deofoliants as a measure to reduce cocaine production).","Caquet√° Titi Monkeys have been observed in disturbed humid tropical lowland forest fragments on terra firme (Defler et al. 2010, Garc√≠a et al. 2010) often surrounded by pasturelands and in low swampy land (Moynihan 1976). The entire known distribution is severely fragmented by human activities.","This species occurs in an area subject to intense human colonization that has caused widespread habitat destruction and fragmentation. The habitat is in an advanced state of fragmentation caused by extensive ranching and illegal crop cultivation. In 2001, more than 50% of the territory of nine municipalities of Caquet√° had been converted to grassland (Garc√≠a et al. 2010). In addition, continuing fumigation of illegal crops with glyphosate causes environmental pollution and has never been evaluated in terms of its damage to arboreal fauna (Garc√≠a et al. 2010). Socioeconomic conditions in southern Caquet√° are difficult, and the rural population suffers from the lack of basic necessities. These conditions threaten the species in as much as many people use the forest fragments to satisfy basic needs, notably hunting for food.","During the surveys conducted during 2008‚Äì2010 (Garc√≠a et al. 2010), 82 animals were seen (including the holotype and the paratype).",Decreasing,"This species occurs in eastern Colombia in the south of Caquet√° department between the Orteguaza and Caquet√° rivers near the base of the Cordillera Oriental de los Andes. It is separated from Callicebus ornatus by 230 km and by Callicebus discolor to the south by 140 km. The limited known range may prove to be larger when more field work is done (Defler et al. 2010, Garc√≠a et al. 2010).",This species is locally hunted for food.,Terrestrial,"So far, no populations have been found in protected areas. Guerilla activity has made it difficult to work in the zone, although J. Garc√≠a has found ways to successfully gather data that rely on local participation and advice. Although there are no large blocks of forest in the area confirmed as the range of C. caquetensis, there are still possible small reserves for this species and the possibilities will be investigated and studied over the next few years (Garc√≠a et al. 2010).

414,South America,Lagothrix flavicauda,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PRIMATES,MAMMALIA,ATELIDAE,Lagothrix,flavicauda,A4cd,"Lagothrix flavicauda is listed as Critically Endangered due to a suspected population decline of greater than 80%, where the causes of reduction have not ceased, and is based on a corresponding decline of suitable, available habitat over the course of 50 years (ca 1985-2030; representing two prior generations and one future generation) and continued hunting.","Lagothrix&#160; flavicauda is known to persist in primary premontane, montane and cloud forest between 1,100 and 2,700 m asl (Leo Luna 1982, Butchart et al. 1995, DeLuycker 2007, Shanee 2011, Allgas et al. 2015). This species has also been observed in white-sand forest, bamboo forest and ridge top forests (Shanee 2014). Home range sizes for this species vary between 92 and 174 ha with average daily path lengths between 1.03 and 1.2 km, both ranges and path lengths vary between seasons (Shanee 2014).Sizes of multi-male/multi-female groups range from 5 to 22 individuals (Leo Luna 1989; Shanee and Shanee 2011, 2015) with average composition of 2.7 (min 1, max 7) adult males, 3.5 (min 1, max 9) adult females, 3.2 (min 1, max 7) juveniles, and 2.1 infants (min 1, max 5) (Shanee and Shanee 2015). Lone individuals of both sexes have also been observed (Shanee and Shanee 2011, 2015).&#160;Lagothrix flavicauda eats a variety of fruits, flowers, leaves, lichens, leaf bases of bromeliads, epiphyte roots and bulbs, and possibly insects (Leo Luna 1982, DeLuycker 2007, Shanee and Shanee 2011, Shanee 2014). At La Esperanza the diet of two groups of L. flavicauda consisted of fruit (46.3%), leaves (23.3%), insects (19.1%), mosses (6.6%), buds (2.8%) and flowers (1.8%) (Shanee 2014). The most commonly consumed arboreal food sources were Cercropia montana, C. utcubamba, Hyeronima andina, Ficus eximia, Ficus spp. Ocotea dasyflora, Erythrina edulis, Styloceras laurifolium, Podocarpus oleifolius, Croton lechleri, Chrysophyllum venezuelanense, Clausia sp. and Allophylus sp. (Shanee 2014). Lagothrix flavicauda modify their diets according to resource availability between the wet and dry seasons, consuming more leaves and insects when fruits are scarce (Shanee 2014).Size: About 10 kg (Leo Luna 1984).","Relative inaccessibility of this species‚Äô cloud forest habitat served as protection for Lagothrix flavicauda up until the 1950s (Leo Luna 1987, 1989). Subsequently, road construction, selective logging and subsistence hunting have led to deforestation, forest fragmentation and population declines (Aquino and Encarnaci√≥n 1994, Butchart et al. 1995, DeLuycker 2007, DeLuycker and Heymann 2007, Shanee et al. 2007, Shanee 2011). More recently, mining operations have increased in this high mountain region. Leo Luna (1984) estimated 11,240 km¬≤ of remaining suitable forest habitat for this species in 1981. Buckingham and Shanee (2008) estimated 6,302 km¬≤ remaining in 2008, representing a prior average annual forest loss of over 180 km¬≤, and noted that 70% of the remaining forest habitat was unprotected. Peruvian ministry reports and GCF data suggest a slightly higher annual forest loss rate (210 km¬≤/year) for San Martin Province, the core of this species range, over the period 2010-2017. These data would seem to suggest that the loss of nearly all remaining unprotected habitat within this species‚Äô range is possible if current rates of deforestation continue to the year 2030.In addition, L. flavicauda is heavily hunted by indigenous communities, market hunters and in retaliation for crop damage. Infants are also routinely taken as pets when mothers are killed (DeLuycker and Heymann 2007, Shanee 2012).","Estimates of current population size for this species vary widely with the best estimates between approximately 1,000 and 10,000 individuals (Mittermeier and Rylands 2013, Shanee and Shanee 2014). This species lives at fairly low population densities of 0.25-1 group per km¬≤&#160;in Rio Abiseo National Park (Leo Luna 1987), 0.93-1.28 groups per km¬≤&#160;at La Esperanza, Amazonas department (Shanee and Shanee 2011, 2015) and 0.93-2.24 groups per km¬≤ in the Abra Patricia-Alto Nieva Private Conservation Area (Cornejo 2007).",Decreasing,"The Yellow-tailed Woolly Monkey is endemic to the montane rain forests and cloud forests of the Departments of San Mart√≠n (eastern part) and Amazonas (south western part) in the Peruvian Andes, south and east of the R√≠o Mara√±√≥n, at altitudes of 1,100 to 2,700 asl (Shanee 2011, Pitman et al.&#160;2014, Allgas et al.&#160;2015). This species also occurs in smaller areas of La Libertad, Hu√°nuco and Loreto (Mittermeier et al. 1975; 1977; Graves and O'Neil 1980; Leo Luna 1980, 1982, 1989; Parker and Barkley 1981; Shanee 2011; Pitman et al. 2014). Its distribution is limited in the north and northwest of Amazonas by the Maranon River valley, to the northeast by the lowlands of Loreto on the border with San Martin, in the east by the Huallaga River Valley. It extends south to either the Santa Martha or Magdalena river valleys in Hu√°nuco. To the southwest and west in Hu√°nuco, La Libertad, and San Martin this species is limited by the high cordillera to the east of the Maranon River. This limit continues north along this line to the start of the Utcubamba River in Amazonas, where it continues until joining with the Maranon River again in the northwest of Amazonas east of the Cordillera Colan. There is also a remnant population of L. flavicauda surviving in forest patches to the west of the Utcubamba River in Amazonas (Shanee 2011).",,Terrestrial,"This species occurs in several protected areas: Rio Abiseo National Park (274,500 ha) (DeLuycker and Heymann 2007)Bosque de Protecci√≥n Alto Mayo (182,000 ha) (DeLuycker 2007)Santuario Nacional Cordillera de Col√°n (64,100 ha)Zona Reservada Rio Nieva (36,000 ha; still awaiting formal categorization) Concessiones para Conservacion El Breo (113,000 ha)Alto Huyabamba (144,000 ha)Martin Sagrado (118,000 ha) Area de Conservacion Privada Los Chilchos (46,000 ha)This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.Although the situation for the Yellow-tailed Woolly Monkey has improved in the last years there is still need for: increased protection within designated parks, reserves, and protected forests, which currently lack enforcement; the establishment of a contiguous area of protected forest, to create a biological corridor; control of illegal logging; purchase of land; the provision of alternative economic models for local communities living along buffer zones in order to prevent further migration into the primary cloud forests; and the implementation of more conservation education (DeLuycker and Heymann 2007).&#160;The NGO Neotropical Primate Conservation began a range-wide conservation project for this species and other primates in 2007, This projects focuses on land protection through: working with local communities and carrying out research; improvement of degraded habitat; creation of public awareness; and commercialisation of sustainable products on behalf of local people.

415,South America,Brachyteles arachnoides,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PRIMATES,MAMMALIA,ATELIDAE,Brachyteles,arachnoides,A2cd,"Brachyteles arachnoides is listed CR based on an inferred or suspected population reduction of at least 80% over the past 60 years (three generations), corresponding to a decline in area of occupancy (AOO) estimated at more than 80%. Population reduction due to habitat loss has been exacerbated by hunting, which has resulted in the extirpation of small- to medium-sized sub-populations and continues to be a significant threat, even in protected areas.","The species inhabits submontane and montane evergreen tropical forest of the Atlantic coast of Brazil. According to Aguirre (1971), Brachyteles arachnoides is found in montane forests between 400-1,880 meters asl, in well-preserved remnants of seasonal and evergreen forests. Recent data indicate the resilience of the taxon in subtropical/tropical montane and deciduous evergreen forests, between 400-1,880 m asl (Talebi in prep). Studies on dietary requirements and feeding ecology were conducted in the Fazenda Barreiro Rico by Milton (1984) and Martins (2003a,b, 2005b, 2006), in the Intervales State Park (Petroni 1993, 2000) and in the Carlos Botelho State Park (Moraes 1992a,b; Lucas et al. 2012, 2016; Ganzhorn et al. 2009; Talebi 2005; Talebi et al. 2005, 2016; Talebi 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014).Size:Adult male size: 1.57 m crown rump size (Talebi et al. 2016)Adult female size: 1.44 m crown rump size (Talebi et al. 2016)Adult male weight: 9.1 kg (n=7) (Talebi and Lee 2010)Adult female weight: 8.3 kg (n=4) (Talebi and Lee 2010)","Historically, forest loss and hunting have been the two most significant threats to Brachyteles arachnoides.Estimates of the original distribution of the genus Brachyteles are based in large part on the studies of Aguirre (1971), undertaken nearly 50 years ago. Recent Spatial Distribution Modelling (SDM) estimates the species‚Äô original area of occupancy (AOO) at 345,760 km¬≤, within which only 20,611 km¬≤ of suitable habitat remains, representing what must be regarded as an irreversible loss of 96% (Ingberman et al. 2016). Deforestation has occurred largely due to an expanding agricultural frontier, cattle ranching, urbanization and development.The current population of the Southern Muriqui is believed to be less than 1,200 individuals surviving in 20 isolated, subpopulations in a mixture of private, municipal, state and national protected areas in the states of Rio de Janeiro (6), Sao Paulo (12) and Parana&#160; (2) (Strier et al. 2017).&#160; Of the subpopulations, one (Carlos Botelho State Park) is believed to contain between 100 and 250 mature individuals, while three (Serra dos Orgaos National Park, Serra do Mar State Park and the Legado Das Aguas Votorantim Reserve) are believed to contain between 50 and 100 mature individuals (Strier et al 2017).Hunting has been severe in past decades and continues to be a significant threat, even within officially protected areas. Since the first regional survey of the two Brachyteles species was conducted nearly 60 years ago, the extirpation of at least a dozen former populations of the Southern Muriqui is believed to have occurred (Aguirre 1971, Rylands et al. 1998, Melo et al. 2005, Nogueira et al. 2009, M. Talebi, pers. comm).","Brachyteles arachnoides is now known to survive in 20 localities: 12 in S√£o Paulo State, two in Parana State, and six in Rio de Janeiro State. The estimated total population is 1,100-1,200 individuals, inhabiting a combination of national, state, municipal and private protected areas, as well as unprotected forests (Talebi and Soares 2016, Strier et al. 2017). The largest subpopulations are those of Carlos Botelho State Park, Serra dos Orgaos National Park, Serra do Mar State Park and the Legado Das Aguas Votorantim Reserve. Several of the subpopulations in S√£o Paulo State exist in small, isolated forest patches and their long-term viability is questionable, while the sub-populations of Tres Picos, Desengano State Park, Cunhambebe State and Serra da Bocaina National Park may actually be larger than previously estimated (Strier et al. 2017). However, a significant number of subpopulations identified by Aguirre (1971) have apparently been extirpated.",Decreasing,"The geographic distribution of Brachyteles arachnoides ranges from the northeast region of Paran√° along the central and eastern region of S√£o Paulo State and the southern region of Rio de Janeiro (Talebi et al. 2011). To the north it occurs as far as the southern margin of the Para√≠ba do Sul River and to the west of this river, it could have reached the south-eastern parts of Minas Gerais on the southern slopes of the Serra da Mantiqueira. One population still exists in the delta of the Piracicaba and Tiete Rivers.Its stronghold today is in the southern region of S√¢o Paulo State, in the montane forests of the Serra de Paranapiacaba (Talebi 2005, Talebi and Soares 2005). Based on Koehler et al. (2005) the species‚Äô range in Paran√° State is restricted to the south by the Ribeira de Iguape River and to the west by the Campo Biome. Within this range, there are only two populations remaining, one at Castro Municipality and another in Doutor Ulysses Municipality. Throughout the region, the only remnant forest of any considerable size is that of the Laur√°ceas State Park (23,000 ha), in a montane region of the Municipalities of Adrian√≥polis and Tunas do Paran√° (Ingberman 2015). In S√£o Paulo State, there are three main strongholds for the species. These are the Serra de Paranapiacaba, in the dense montane forests of&#160; the Municipalities of S√£o Miguel Arcanjo and Cap√£o Bonito, the Carlos Botelho State Park (24¬∞15-44‚ÄôS, 47¬∞46-48¬∞10¬¥W), and the Funda√ß√£o Florestal do Estado de S√£o Paulo. Additional field sites protecting known subpopulations in the region include a protected private reserve, i.e., the Muriqui Ecopark (Pr√≥-Muriqui Association), and two corporate private business areas, i.e., Fazenda S√£o Miguel Klabin and Legado das √Åguas Reserve Votorantim. These areas represent the core areas of the World Heritage Site Atlantic Forest South-East Reserves (decreed in 1999 and considered of outstanding universal value in 2015).For the Serra do Mar region containing the largest protected area of S√£o Paulo, the Parque Estadual Serra do Mar is supposed to protect the species. Although several areas have been proven to have experienced local extinctions, the exact distributional status of the species in the region is unknown, but is certainly declining. In the Serra da Mantiqueira, bordering the States of Minas Gerais and S√£o Paulo, a few remnants of forest still remain and only two localities, the S√£o Sebasti√£o Fibria Farm (22¬∞45¬¥S 45¬∞28¬¥W) and the region of S√£o Francisco Xavier (23¬∞12‚ÄôS 45¬∞52‚ÄôW) are confirmed as current areas in which the species survives. In addition, the last remnant of interior deciduous forest, the Barreiro Rico Farm, contains a vanishing population in the municipality of Anhembi, located in the deltas of the Tiete and Piracicaba Rivers (Talebi and Soares 2005, Talebi et al. 2011, Talebi et al. 2016).

In 2000 the NGO Associa√ß√£o Pr√≥-Muriqui was set up (PHVA Muriqui 1998) to ensure continued research activities in the park and elsewhere in S√£o Paulo (Talebi and Soares 2005). At the present this long term research project monitors the populations of Carlos Botelho State Park, Legado das √Åguas, Sao Sebastiao Farm, S√£o Miguel Farm and will soon start in Barreiro Rico. These and other science based conservation actions follow the guidelines of&#160; public conservation policies, the federal conservation policy, the National Action Plan Muriqui, the S√£o Paulo State Conservation Public Policy, the Primate State Conservation Plan, and the directives published by the Pr√≥-Primatas Comission (S√£o Paulo State 2015).Conservation policy: A Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA) was carried out for both species of Brachyteles in 1998 (Rylands et al. 1998), which sparked a series of surveys in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Esp√≠rito Santo, Bahia and in S√£o Paulo State. It further led to the foundation of the Associa√ß√£o Pr√≥-Muriqui, a NGO coordinating research within S√£o Paulo State. In 2002, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment (IBAMA) set up the Committee for the Conservation and Management of the Muriqui (Oliveira et al. 2005). In 2011 the Instituto Chico Mendes da Conserva√ß√£o da Biodiversidade (ICMBIO) published The National Action Plan Muriqui. In 2015, S√£o Paulo State launched the Pr√≥-Primatas Comission, a permanent commission responsible for elaborating conservation policies for state-wide action on threatened primate species.Ex situ conservation:Captive breeding has been problematic due to low levels of reproduction and poor infant survival. There is a small, but promising, captive breeding programme for the species in Sorocaba Zoo, which has been successful on maintaining the species. There also exists the continued ex situ program for the species at Rio de Janeiro Primate Center (Coimbra- Filho et al. 1993, Pissinatti et al. 1998, Pissinatti 2005) but none of these institutions has been successful in regularly generating or maintaining offspring. The National Action Plan Muriqui established three reference institutions for captive breeding of the species, i.e., Sorocaba Zoo (S√£o Paulo), Passeio Publico Zoo, Curitiba (Paran√°), and Rio de Janeiro Primate Centre.&#160; Some zoos in S√£o Paulo (e.g., Sorocaba and Santos) receive wild-born muriqui pets every year, originating mostly from palm-harvesters and hunters who have killed the mothers. Conservation planning for a dedicated breeding program in S√£o Paulo State would greatly enhance our understanding of southern muriquis as well as providing a backup for population extinctions in the wild.This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

In addition, based upon a detailed demographic analysis (Strier and Ives 2012), one of the two largest subpopulations (RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala) has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years and is considered unstable despite its overall growth.","The current population of the Northern Muriqui, Brachyteles hypoxanthus, is believed to be less than 1,000 individuals total, surviving in 14 isolated, subpopulations in a mixture of private, municipal, state and national protected areas in the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro that cover a combined area of less than 200,000 ha (Mendes et al. 2005, Jerusalinsky et al. 2011, Talebi et al. 2011, Strier et al. 2017). The four largest subpopulations‚ÄîRPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala, Serra do Brigadeiro State Park, Rio Doce State Park and Santa Maria do Jetiba‚Äîare given 'the greatest potential for persistence' (Strier and Ives 2012, Strier et al. 2017), while the remaining subpopulations are significantly smaller, all with numbers of mature individuals either in the low double-digits or even single digits, and may not be viable over the long-term (Jerusalinsky et al. 2011, Strier et al. 2017).&#160; Even the largest subpopulation (RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala) has shown severe population fluctuations in recent years (Strier et al. 2017).",Decreasing,"The range of the northern muriqui (B. hypoxanthus) covers the Atlantic forest of the states of Minas Gerais, Esp√≠rito Santo and Bahia, excluding the lowland forests in the extreme south of Bahia and northern Esp√≠rito Santo (Aguirre 1971, Melo et al. 2004, Mendes et al. 2005a, Melo 2005, Talebi et al. 2011). According to Aguirre (1971), the northern limit to its range was probably the Rio Jequiri√ß√° basin, which flows into the Ba√≠a de Todos os Santos, and including the forests of the right bank of the Rio Paragua√ßu. The southern limit is more poorly defined, but it probably extended to the Serra da Mantiqueira, in southern Minas Gerais, near to the state boundaries with Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo (Aguirre 1971,Mittermeier et al. 1987, Lemos de S√° and Glander 1993, Strier and Fonseca 1996‚Äì1997).Recently, a single known population in the state of Rio de Janeiro was confirmed in Itatiaia National Park (Cunha et al. 2009, Aximoff 2015). However, the population is already known since the 1990s (Hall 1995), but without assigning a specific status. According to Talebi et al. (2011), Northern Muriqui populations are located mostly in some forest fragments in Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, and have been virtually extinct in Bahia (Oliver and Santos 1991; Rylands et al. 1995, 2000; Melo et al. 2004). Currently a population of Northern Muriqui was recorded reported from Alto Cariri National Park, located in Guaratinga, Bahia. Another new population was recorded in the Wildlife Refuge Forest of Muriquis, located between the cities of Salto da Divisa and Santa Maria do Salto, both in Minas Gerais, at the border of Bahia State (Melo et al. 2004). In addition, to the species‚Äô records from&#160; the Itatiaia National Park at the border of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais States, there are unconfirmed reports of its presence in the environment of this protected area, specifically in Maramba (Andr√© Cunha pers. comm.) and in some municipalities of Minas Gerais, such as Itamonte (Marcelo Passamani pers. comm.). Search for muriquis in the forest is pretty easy because it is the largest primate in the neotropics with a unique long call vocalisation. However, most of the few remaining populations inhabit mountainous areas, which makes the exact definition of some distribution limits extremely difficult (Talebi et al. 2011). Given that there are currently only 13 known remaining populations (Talebi et al. 2011) in isolated forest fragments, and considering the virtual extinction of the species in Bahia (Oliver and Santos 1991; Rylands et al. 1995, 2000) as well as the fact that its historical geographical distribution should cover the Atlantic Forest in those states (with the exception of the lowlands in southern Bahia and northern Esp√≠rito Santo; Aguirre 1971, Talebi et al. 2011.), it appears that the current distribution of the taxon is greatly reduced in relation to its historical occurrence (Mendes et al. 2008a, 2008b; Talebi et al. 2011). In addition, the local extinction of the species has been confirmed in many localities, including protected areas, such as the Biological Station of Santa Lucia - ES, Biological Station of St. Lawrence - ES, Forest Reserve Two Mouths - ES and Forest Reserve Pedra Azul - ES (Mendes 1991). The extent of its occurrence was estimated at 100,000 km¬≤&#160;and its occurrence area is 1,870 km¬≤ (Mendes et al. 2008a, 2008b; Talebi et al. 2011).",The species is hunted for food and sport.,Terrestrial,"This species occurs in the following protected areas (Strier et al. 2017):Capara√≥ National Park, Esp√≠rito Santo (31,853 ha) (Gomes and Melo 2005)Itatiaia National Park, southern Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro (28,155 ha) (Aximoff 2015)Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve, Esp√≠rito Santo (3,573 ha) (Pinto et al. 1993, Vierira and Mendes, 2005, Carla Possamai pers. comm.)Mata Escura Biological Reserve, Minas Gerais (50,890 ha) (Melo et al. 2002, 2004, Melo 2004)Ibitipoca State Park, Minas Gerais (1,488 ha) (Fontes et al. 1996, Moreira et al. 2003, Oliveira 2003, Ferraz et al. 2005)Rio Doce State Park, Minas Gerais, (35,976 ha) (Mendes et al. 2005a,c)Serra do Brigadeiro State Park, Minas Gerais (13,210 ha) (Moreira et al. 2003, Leandro S.

This has now resulted in a series of surveys in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Esp√≠rito Santo and Bahia. From 1983 to 1998, the Caratinga Biological Station was the only long-term field station conducting research on this species (Strier and Boubli 2006), but following the PHVA workshop long-term research was also initiated in Esp√≠rito Santo, Santa Maria do Jetib√°, by the Instituto de Pesquisas da Mata Atl√¢ntica (IPEMA) and by the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo. The use of population viability modelling has been continued since then as a tool for conservation planning for muriquis (Strier 1993/1994; Mendes et al. 2005a; Brito and Grelle 2006). In 2002, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment (IBAMA) set up the Committee for the Conservation and Management of the Muriqui (Oliveira et al. 2005). From 2001 to 2003 the Project for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Brazilian Biological Diversity (Projeto de Conserva√ß√£o e Utiliza√ß√£o Sustent√°vel da Diversidade Biol√≥gica Brasileira ‚Äì PROBIO), of the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), approved financing three projects for the conservation and management of the northern muriqui. They are coordinated by three NGOs, the Instituto de Pesquisas da Mata Atl√¢ntica (IPEMA), the Funda√ß√£o Biodiversitas, and the Instituto Dr√≠ades. Two important meetings resulted from this, the first in January 2003 in Santa Maria de Jetib√°, Esp√≠rito Santo, and the second in March 2004 in Belo Horizonte. They provided the information and directives for the elaboration of a management plan for the species (in prep., see Mendes et al. 2005a).Currently, there are research programmes on, and conservation initiatives for, muriquis being carried out in six localities, four in Minas Gerais (RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala, RPPN Mata do Sossego, and Serra do Brigadeiro and Rio Doce state parks) and two in Esp√≠rito Santo (Capara√≥ National Park and Santa Maria de Jetib√°). These studies and initiatives cover about 90% of the entire population of B. hypoxanthus (see Mendes et al. 2005a). Besides population monitoring and ecological/behavioural studies, research is being carried out on population genetics (Fagundes 2005; Chaves et al. 2006), parasite infections and ecology (Stuart and Strier 1995; Pissinatti 2005), and captive breeding, veterinary aspects, nutrition, husbandry and management (Mendes et al. 2005a; Pissinatti 2005). Also, some management activities are carried out by researchers in Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo States. A successful translocation was done in Minas Gerais, where an isolated female was translocated to RPPN Mata do Sossego. Since then, this female has produced four cubs; one of them is now a reproductive male.There is a small but promising captive breeding programme for the Southern species - Brachyteles arachnoides (Coimbra- Filho et al. 1993, Pissinatti et al. 1998, Pissinatti 2005).This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Known at altitudes up to 400 m, but could occur in higher elevations (to 1,500 m) in the upper valley of the R√≠o Sinu (Defler 2004).Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging trees trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet. The dentition of the tamarins (Saguinus and Leontopithecus) does not provide for gouging and they eat gums only when readily available. Tamarins live in extended family groups of between four and 15 individuals, but usually 2-8. Saguinus oedipus lives in groups of 2-9. Neyman (1977, 1979) observed groups of 3-13, and&#160;Savage et al. (1996a,b) observed reproductively active groups that ranged in size from 3-6. Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season.&#160;Size:Tamarins are monomorphic - exhibiting only minor differences in body and canine size.Adults H&amp;B 20.8-25.9 cm, TL 33.0-41.0 cm (Hershkovitz 1977)Weight 416.5 g (n = 10) (Savage 1990).","Saguinus oedipus occurs in an area of intensive colonization and forest loss. Neyman (1978) estimated that 75% of the original distribution of S. oedipus had been cleared for agriculture and pasture, and that the remainder of its range was represented by small isolated forest patches along with its main stronghold, the Paramillo National Natural Park of 460,000 ha. Cerquera (1985) reported on the threats regarding the construction of two hydroelectric dams, Urra I and Urra II, on the R√≠os Sinu and San Jorge, in the south of its range. Urra II is sited within the Paramillo National Natural Park and is expected to flood more than 54,000 ha of primary and secondary forest, within what is considered to be the last major stronghold for the species.The three protected areas where they occur have lost a significant portion of their forests (Barbosa et al. 1988). Paramillo has lost approximately 42% of its original forested habitat and Montes de Maria and Los Colorados lost 70 and 71%, respectively. To date, almost 200,000 ha of the original forested areas within protected boundaries of the parks and reserves dedicated to Cotton-top Tamarin conservation efforts have been lost. This suggests, therefore, that there is less than 2,600 km¬≤ that will be protected in perpetuity for Cotton-top Tamarins by the Colombian Ministerio del Medio Ambiente. Although these areas are protected, they continue to suffer from the pressure of the growing local populations to extract resources or clear areas for agricultural activities.Defler (1994, 2004; pp.196-201) discusses the conservation status and threats to this species (see also Defler and Rodr√≠guez-Mahecha 2003, Defler et al. 2003).","In the late 1960s and early 1970s, 20,000-30,000 individuals were exported to the United States for biomedical research (Hern√°ndez-Camacho and Cooper 1976). Current population estimates for the species are 6,000 individuals (approximately 2,000 mature individuals).",Decreasing,"Saguinus oedipus occurs in northwestern Colombia between the R√≠o Atrato and the lower R√≠o Cauca (west of the R√≠o Cauca and the Isla de Mompos) and Magdalena, in the Departments of Atlantico, Sucre, Cordoba, and western Bolivar, northwestern Antiquoia (from the Uraba region, west of the R√≠o Cauca) and northeastern Choco, east of the R√≠o Atrato, from sea level up to 1,500 m (Hern√°ndez-Camacho and Cooper 1976, Hershkovitz 1977, Hern√°ndez-Camacho and Defler 1989, Mast et al. 1993 ).The south-western boundary of the cotton-top's range has not been clearly identified. Mast et al. (1983) suggested that it may extend to Villa Arteaga on the R√≠o Sucio (Hershkovitz 1977), which included reports of Cotton-top Tamarins in Los Katios National Park. However, Barbosa et al. (1988) were unable to find any evidence of Cotton-top Tamarins in this area nor in Los Katios, where they observed only Saguinus geoffroyi. Neyman (1981) did not find evidence of cotton-top tamarins in the upper Sinu.&#160; Groups have been seen in the Islas del Rosario and Tayrona National Park in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Mast et al. 1993; A. Savage and L.H. Giraldo pers. obs.). However, these populations were founded by captive animals that were released into the area (Mast et al. 1993) and these remnant populations are here considered as outside of the historic range of the species.","In the past, animals were caught in the wild for the pet and zoo trade and also for use in biomedical laboratories..",Terrestrial,"Legally protected in Colombia since 1969. Major threat in the past was export for the pet trade, zoos and biomedical research, but export was banned in 1974. Listed on CITES Appendix I.There are three protected areas where Saguinus oedpipus occurs: Paramillo National Natural Park (460,000 ha), decreed in 1977; Los Colorados Fauna and Flora Sanctuary (1,000 ha) decreed in 1977; and Reserva Forestal Cerro de Coraza-Monte de Marja (7,460 ha) decreed in 1983. They were also introduced to Tayrona National Natural Park in 1974 (Defler 1994).Proyecto Tit√≠, a conservation programme for the Cotton-top Tamarin in Colombia, was established in 1987 to begin the first long-term field study on this species in collaboration with Colombian biologists, educators, NGO's and government authorities (INDERENA, Ministerio del Medio Ambiente) (Savage 1988, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997; Savage et al. 1996a,b, 1997, 2001a,b). Initial research focused on understanding the factors influencing reproductive strategies of Cotton-top Tamarins, but it quickly grew into a comprehensive conservation programme including educational efforts, capacity building, training Colombian students, development of economic alternatives, and the development of an agricultural training programme to decrease the pressure on the forest by local communities (Savage and Giraldo 1990; Savage et al. 1990, 1996, 1997).In addition to the studies of Cotton-top Tamarins in the field, there has been a major and comprehensive assessment of the remaining habitat within the historic distribution of the Cotton-top Tamarin in Colombia, along with surveys to assess population numbers remaining.

In primary forests like Reserva Ducke the density is lower than in small fragments (Gordo 2012).&#160;They eat fruits, nectar, plant exudates and animal prey (including frogs, lizards, eggs, small birds, spiders and insects). They live in extended family groups of four to 15 individuals. Subir√° (1998b) recorded group sizes of 3 to 15 individuals (mean 6.19 ¬± 2.62, n=46). Vidal and Cintra (2006) recorded group sizes that range from 2 to 11 individuals with a man group size of&#160; 4.8 individuals (n = 41). Gordo (2012) recorded group sizes of 2 to 13 individuals (mean 5.8 ¬± 2.02; n = 87). Generally, only one female per group breeds during a particular breeding season. Tamarin groups have home ranges of 10-100 ha, the size depending on the availability and distribution of food and on forest characteristics. A Saguinus bicolor group studied in the extensive forest of the Adolfo Ducke Forest Reserve was found to use a home range of about 100 ha (Gordo et al. 2011.)Aspects of the behaviour, ecology and conservation of Saguinus bicolor were studied by Egler (1986, 1992, 1993), Gordo et al. (2011), Gordo (2012) and Gordo et al. (2013) at Tarum√£-A√ß√∫, near Manaus. She studied a group of 6-10 individuals for 11 months from 1983 to 1984. Twins were born by a single breeding female in May and November 1983. The group used 12 ha of forest, which included mature old growth, old and young secondary forest and white sand forest (campinarana).Size:Head and body: 20.8-28.3 cm, tail: 33.5-42.0 cm (Gregorin and Tahara 2008)Males: 428 g (n=4) (Smith and Jungers 1997).","The principal threats to Saguinus bicolor include deforestation and habitat fragmentation related to expanding rural settlements and agriculture, livestock production, urban development, an expanding energy matrix and road network, all within this species' concentrated range in the vicinity of Manaus, the state capital of Amazonas.&#160; In addition, S. bicolor is also routinely collected for and negatively impacted by the pet trade, threatened by competition with the golden-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), and suffers high mortality due to predation by dogs and cats, disease, and electrocution on transmission lines (Gordo 2012, 2013).","This species is commonly seen in fragmented habitats, more than in primary forests (Gordo 2012). Saguinus bicolor groups survive in small, highly degraded forest patches around housing estates and in the suburbs of Manaus. Saguinus midas populations are gradually replacing S. bicolor in the extremes of S. bicolor‚Äôs range (Ayres et al. 1980, 1982; revision in R√∂he 2006). Gordo (2012) estimated the population size in 30 forest fragments of different size, observing that the individual density decreases when fragment size increases. Small fragments like Park Mindu Fragment with 46 ha have two groups and eight individuals; Park Suma√∫ma with 56 ha has two groups with 15 individuals; RS Pinto fragment with 3 ha has one group with five individuals; University fragment with 776 ha has 24 groups with 145 individuals; and Reserva Ducke with 10,000 ha has 620 individuals in 120 groups.It is suspected that the population will suffer a reduction of at least 80% over the next three generations (18 years) due to serious multiple threats suffered within a very concentrated range in and around the city of Manaus, including: deforestation and habitat fragmentation related to expanding rural settlements and agriculture, livestock production, urban development, and an expanding energy matrix and road network; routinely collection for the pet trade; competition with the Golden-handed Tamarin (Saguinus midas); high mortality due to predation by dogs and cats; disease; and electrocution on transmission lines.",Decreasing,"Saguinus bicolor occurs north of the Rio Amazonas, east of the Rio Negro, in the vicinity of Manaus, the capital of the Amazonas State, Brazil. Surveys by Ayres et al. (1980, 1982) reported that its range extended only 30-45 km to the North of Manaus and to the East as far as the town of Itacoatiara, approximately 100 km from the capital. Localities beyond these points indicate only the presence of S. midas. Ayres et al. (1980, 1982) and Hershkovitz (1966) suggested that it might occur to the Rio Jauaper√≠, a left bank tributary of the Rio Negro. However, Subir√° (1998a, b) considered this to be unlikely. Subir√° (1998b) found Saguinus bicolor only as far as 35 km from Manaus on the BR174 highway. North of the highway, she found only S. midas.In a more recent study, Subir√° (1998b) and R√∂he (2006) found Saguinus midas much closer to Manaus City and restricted to the West of the Urubu River. R√∂he (2006) estimated S. bicolor‚Äôs distribution in an area of 5,540 km¬≤, limited by the Cuieiras River in the West, Urubu River in the East, the Negro and Amazonas Rivers in the South and its contact with S. midas in the North. The same study (R√∂he et al. unpl. data) shows a deforestation rate around 200 km¬≤/year additional to the loss to Saguinus midas, which amounts to 55 km¬≤/year.

May 2013).&#160;&#160;Also, given the microendemism of the species, the SHP installation activities themselves have potential to severely impact the population. Moreover, alterations in the Forqueta river flow and possible environmental changes on its margins may even have more deleterious consequences to the species. The reproductive sites of the species are located along the river margins and their availability is clearly associated with natural fluctuations in the river flow&#160;(M. Borges-Martins, C. Zank, M. Abadie, L.F. Fonte and T. Mendes pers. comm. June 2012). Additionally, while&#160;tobacco and eucalyptus plantations and livestock production occur in the region and account for&#160;the observed forest fragmentation, the area where the species is found is surrounded by very steep slopes and is therefore not directly impacted by these activities (M. Borges-Martins, C. Zank, M. Abadie, L.F. Fonte and T. Mendes pers. comm. May 2013). The Rio Grande do Sul State Environmental Agency (Funda√ß√£o Estadual de Prote√ß√£o Ambiental-RS), which is responsible for licensing, did not require any monitoring activity that could assess possible impacts of installation and/or operation of the SHP, even though the species was recorded in the obligatory Environmental Impact Report&#160;(M. Borges-Martins, C. Zank, M. Abadie, L.F. Fonte and T. Mendes pers. comm. June 2012). Another potential threat, still not quantified, is the contamination by pesticides used on tobacco crops near the species' range, along the Forqueta River basin (Abadie et al. 2011, Zank et al. 2012).","It&#160;is frequently encountered along the margins of the river Forqueta; however, its restricted EOO and AOO suggest that the population is circumscribed and very small&#160;(M.

Borges-Martins, C. Zank, M. Abadie, L.F. Fonte and T. Mendes pers. comm. June 2012), which suggest a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals. There is also a plausible strong projected decrease in the next years due to the planned installation of a small hydroelectric power plant (SHP) in the river&#160;(M. Borges-Martins, C. Zank, M.

Given&#160;current knowledge, this species is considered to occur in a single threat-defined location based on the potentially high risk&#160;to the entire population&#160;comprised by the establishment of a hydroelectric power plant&#160;(M.

In addition, given that this species has been the focus of much media attention in the state of Rio Grande do Sul due to the situation involving the development of the small hydroelectric power plant, and given that pictures and precise locality information were disclosed through the media, it would not be surprising that it finds itself in the pet trade, which would comprise an important and continuing impact to its survival in the wild (M. Borges-Martins, C. Zank, M. Abadie, L.F. Fonte and T. Mendes pers. comm. May 2013). In general, species of&#160;this genus&#160;have high potential for use as pets or for bioprospection, such as other anuran species which are toxic and/or present aposematic coloration, which could result in illegal collection and traffic of native individuals (M.

Recent surveys have failed to record the species at several known localities, and it is possible that one or more subpopulations may already have been lost.","The natural habitat of this species is coastal desert &#160;in areas with substrate dry soil or sand with some rocks, and without vegetation. Currently this kind of habitat is restricted to a few localities in the city of Lima. Phyllodactylus sentosus shows great fidelity to its small home range (P√©rez 2009), a low reproductive rate (Dixon and Huey, 1970) and poor dispersal ability (Perez et al. 2013). The known subpopulations are confined to small archaeological monuments that preserve natural desert habitat.

Although it appears to be dependent on small, fast-moving streams, it is unclear if this habitat is utilized for breeding; no larvae have been found in these streams despite intensive searching (R.

In particular, two mining concessions were approved for the area in which the reserve occurs, covering the entire known range of the species, and threatening the integrity of the forest; exploration activities have been recorded within the boundaries of the reserve (S.

Its population size has decreased more than 99% due to water abstraction, agriculture and urban pollution and habitat modification such as channelization and dam construction. These threats are known, have not ceased and are irreversible since the species has apparently disappeared in all rivers except one. This decrease of the population size was inferred by the reduction of the extent of occurrence by more than 99% over the last three generations (45 years) due to the potential high levels of exploitation and the high level of contaminants in most of the rivers within its former range. It has an estimated area of occupancy of 44 km¬≤, occurring in only one location and with an ongoing decrease of extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, habitat quality and number of locations.","The species has been reported from&#160;the middle and lower sections of the Magdalena River tributaries on sedimentary rocks with occasional occurrence on igneous rocks.

The Water Quality Index for the Opia River basin varied between Good to Regular (Lopez-Delgado&#160;et al. 2009). The life cycle of A. rivolii includes parental care and parasitism on fishes by lasidium larvae (Arteaga-Sogamoso 1993). Larvae of A. rivolii were found encysted on 11 species of fish: Andinoacaras pulcher, Cetopsorhamdia molinae, Geophagus steindachneri, Chaetostoma milesi, Chaetostoma fischeri, Heptapterus sp., Pimelodella chagresi, Lasciancistus caucanus, Roeboides dayi, Argopleura magdalenensis and&#160;Creagrutus sp.

From the 18 rivers where the species was known to occur in 1973, the species is only presently found in a small stretch of the Opia River in the Tolima Department. As a result, a management plan has been developed in order to regulate the extraction and commerce of this species (Lopez-Delgado&#160;et al. 2009). From surveys taken on 20 sampling stations along the Opia River, densities varied between 0 to 6.67 ind/m¬≤ (Lopez-Delgado et al. 2009).

If this species is found to be more widespread in future surveys it will warrant immediate reassessment, however, to date multiple annual surveys have failed to record evidence that this species occurs more widely than is presently known.","All the specimens were collected on large, dark, granitic, isolated inselbergs that stand out abruptly from the surrounding semi-deciduous forest, and which are locally known as ‚Äúlajas‚Äù. Specimens were collected directly from the rock walls of two nearby and relatively small inselbergs. Three of the specimens were collected from an inselberg consisting of three large rocks placed in such a way that they formed a small ‚ÄúC‚Äù shaped refuge on the ground, which protected the enclosed area from fire and also helped retain water in it. The two other specimens were collected on the top inner surface of the entrance of a cave-like, horizontal hole on a nearby inselberg.

Total area of occupancy is estimated at less than 10 km¬≤. The species' habitat is being affected by water extraction for pasture, periodic vegetation clearing from creeks by communities in order to improve the water supply, and pollution from urban areas (traditional practice of cloth washing in the water in springs, creeks and streams, traditional practice of using aquatic bodies as corridors to move the cattle within the watershed, use of the local agave called ""cabuya"" for washing clothes in the creeks and streams is known to have active chemical substances that kill aquatic fauna, including fish).&#160; The use of pre√±adilla as bait for largemouth bass fishing and for food consumption is likely causing a decline in the number of mature individuals. The species is therefore listed as Critically Endangered.","Extensive sampling showed that this species is not presently found in Imbakucha Lake and that individuals are concentrated in small lotic-habitat fragments characterized by the presence of springs (V√©lez-Espino and Fox 2005). Individuals of Astroblepus ubidiai are concentrated in small areas (range 40‚Äì650 m¬≤) and restricted to island-like habitats, which can be properly defined as refuges (V√©lez-Espino 2005). The fact that the habitats of all subpopulations are either springs or headwaters is probably not because those are the keystone habitats, but&#160; because those are the habitats least favourable to the causes of decline (V√©lez-Espino 2006).  Pre√±adilla‚Äôs use of underground refugia was first mentioned by Humboldt and Bonpland (1805). V√©lez-Espino (2005) observed pre√±adilla to enter interstitial spaces and penetrate into the outlet of springs. The importance of underground water in the life cycle of the species is not known but the genus Astroblepus is known to have troglobitic (exclusively subterranean) and troglophilic (facultative subterranean) species.A continuing decline in the in the extent and quality of the habitat has been observed due mainly to pollution from urban areas.","Standard anthropogenic perturbations to this species' habitat are the deviation of water currents towards pasture grounds, the periodic vegetation clearing from creeks by communities in order to improve the water supply, the use of pre√±adilla as bait for largemouth bass fishing, the traditional custom of cloth washing in the water in springs, creeks and streams, and the traditional custom also of using aquatic bodies as corridors to move the cattle within the watershed (V√©lez-Espino 2005). The use of the local agave called ""cabuya"" (Cactaceae) for the washing of clothes in the creeks and streams is known to have active chemical substances that kill aquatic fauna, including fish (V√©lez-Espino 2006).  Overfishing may not have been a problem before the population was fragmented by habitat loss (V√©lez-Espino 2006). The current fragmentation between subpopulations within the Imbakucha basin has been enhanced by the introduction of exotics (V√©lez-Espino 2003). The concentration of A. ubidiai in a few small localities increases its vulnerability and jeopardizes its persistence, as there is lower probability that dispersers successfully reach other refuges, thus hindering a positive effect of migration on the regional population size (V√©lez-Espino 2003). During the recovery of the traditional ecological knowledge it was evident that five of former pre√±adilla habitats were converted into reservoirs for human supply and floriculture, four were transformed into community-washing places, two were dried as a consequence of inappropriate agricultural activities, and one was converted into a religious sanctuary (the cave called ""El Socav√≥n"" which traditional knowledge recognized as a former source of pre√±adilla) (V√©lez-Espino 2006). Another former refuge, the Araque spring, was observed in February 2000 to contain the species, but by July of the same year it no longer contained pre√±adilla (V√©lez-Espino 2003).  In the Imbakucha basin (Proa√±o, Gallopogyo and Quinde), all six anthropogenic perturbations occur in all of the sites (V√©lez-Espino 2006). Approximately 30,000 inhabitants distributed in 38 communities within an area of 150 km¬≤ have impacted on pre√±adilla habitat and could be a cause of the poor habitat quality (V√©lez-Espino 2006).","Six A. ubidiai subpopulations were located in the region from information provided by indigenous residents, followed by extensive field surveys (V√©lez-Espino 2006). These subpopulations are distributed in four different drainage basins and their probabilities of escape to other refugia when the environment deteriorates are very limited due to natural and anthropogenic barriers between drainages (V√©lez-Espino 2006). Pasture grounds, fields, human settlements, and the presence of the piscivorous largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in Imbakucha Lake appear to have resulted in the segregation of those populations within this watershed (V√©lez-Espino 2005). Each sub-population appears demographically independent (V√©lez-Espino 2006), thus the population is considered as severely fragmented as most of its individuals are in isolated sub-populations (Velez-Espino and Fox 2005). During a field study carried out between 2000-2001 in the area where the species occurs, the disappearance of one sub-population in the Imbakucha basin was witnessed (V√©lez-Espino 2005).Fishing pressure, either for food or bait, may be affecting the adult portion of the population (V√©lez-Espino 2005), probably causing a decline in the number of mature individuals.",Unknown,"Astroblepus ubidiai is the only historically documented native fish of the Imbakucha basin, Imbabura Province, Ecuador (V√©lez-Espino 2006).

Nevertheless, the reasons for the sudden decline of this species remain unclear.","It has been recorded in leaf-litter in temperate mixed forests, and also in small streams surrounded by forests.

When the larvae inside the eggs begin to move, adult males ingest the eggs and incubate them in their vocal sacs, where the larvae develop until they are regurgitated into streams where metamorphosis takes place.","The destruction of the native vegetation through the planting of pine plantations and for the building of second homes probably impacts this species. However this is unlikely to explain its disappearance completely, the causes of which are not fully understood.

During the day, adults are found primarily in galleries inside the edges of these streams. The water is transparent, with relatively neutral pH and very high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (Corbal√°n et al. 2008, 2010). Because of this strong association with water, the species' area of occupancy is restricted to meadows (Corbal√°n et al. 2010), leaving the subpopulations isolated to these patches.Eggs are laid in clumps, surrounded by a protective jelly, and are very difficult to find (Corbal√°n et al. 2014).&#160;Studies carried out with marked individuals revealed that the species' larval period&#160;involves at least four winters as tadpoles (Corbal√°n et al. 2014). Larvae of different cohorts (hatched in different years) coexist at the same microsites (i.e., ponds or backwater sections of the streams;&#160;Corbal√°n&#160;et al.&#160;2008, 2014). During the summer months tadpoles grow, and during the winter months they overwinter submerged in ice or snow-covered water bodies (Corbal√°n&#160;et al. 2014).","The paving of the international route (Paso Pehuenche) has led to a drastic population decrease in Argentina. The paving&#160;affected the course of one of the streams in 2008, despite the remediation that was attempted in 2009 (Corbal√°n&#160;et al. 2010). The original stream, which was surrounded by wetlands ('vegas'), dried and led to mortality of frogs. The new stream formed in an area without vegetation and is not suitable for colonization of the species&#160;(Corbal√°n et al. 2010). This problem has not been resolved. Recent modifications made to the route caused the mortality of at least 88 individuals between March 2017 and January 2018 because chambers that were intended to capture saltwater from the road in order to avoid contamination of the streams also&#160;incidentally&#160;functioned as pit-fall traps for the frogs&#160;(W. Prado pers. comm. March 2017, V.&#160;Corbal√°n pers. comm. February 2018, BIOTA 2018). The chambers still remain in place, so unless urgent actions are taken more mortalities are anticipated (V.&#160;Corbal√°n pers. comm. September 2017). The paved road is also considered to be a future threat given its potential to modify water quality, particularly in the lower reaches of the streams. Contaminant particles from vehicular transit could reach the highly oxygenated streams via lixiviation or winds (Corbal√°n&#160;et al. 2010). In addition, the salt used for snow melting on the road during winter seep into the streams, potentially altering the ionic composition, conductivity and salinity of water (Corbal√°n&#160;et al. 2010, 2014).&#160;The area is also impacted by domestic livestock (cows and goats), which trample on swamps and small ponds (Corbal√°n&#160;et al. 2010). In January 2016, previously surveyed and occupied ponds that had shown clear waters now appeared murky and polluted, and were no longer inhabited (V. Corbal√°n pers. comm. March 2016).&#160;An additional threat factor is posed by tourist waste, as tourists who visit the area leave large amounts of plastic and other non-biodegradable items in the streams, which is especially pronounced after bi-national annual meetings at the international border (Corbal√°n&#160;et al.&#160;2010). Furthermore, an expected increase in vehicular traffic due to road paving completion is also likely to increase domestic waste in the area (Corbal√°n et al. 2010). Introduced trout are another potential threat, and this species has now been confirmed in one of the streams in January 2016, where it had not been seen before (V. Corbal√°n pers. comm. March 2016). It remains to be seen whether trout feed on frogs or larvae, which if so would be affecting the population directly via predation, in addition to reducing the power of dispersal and consequent reduction in genetic diversity of the species (V. Corbal√°n pers. comm. September 2017). Climate change could also be a potential threat to this species, as a change in the hydrological cycle could directly affect the frog population (Corbal√°n&#160;et al.&#160;2010). However, climate change modelling studies specific to this area still need to be carried out to determine the potential impact of climate change (Corbal√°n&#160;et al.&#160;2010). Taking into account the long larval period, a drastic change in habitat conditions by any of these threats could affect several tadpole generations at the same time (V. Corbal√°n pers. comm. September 2017).Correa et al. (2013) mention that the threats highlighted in Corbal√°n et al. (2010) (pollution by vehicle particle emissions, livestock, alteration of watercourses, natural floods and climate change) may also affect the newly reported Chilean sites. To date, the effects of livestock and the presence of garbage have been verified, which are particularly intense at sites close to the border crossing (Paso Pehuenche), but all sites could be potentially threatened by environmental factors such as natural floods and climate change (C. Correa and D. V√°squez pers. comm. December 2017).In Chile, the presence of chytrid fungus (Bd) has now been recorded for this species.&#160;In 2017, 115 samples of skin swab samples from seven sites distributed in streams near Pehuenche International Pass, Laguna del Maule and Lo Aguirre sector were analyzed (D. V√°squez et al. unpubl. data). Of the seven sites, the presence of chytrid fungus was recorded in six of them, with a prevalence of 40.87% of the total of individuals (D. V√°squez et al. unpubl. data). Although it is not known whether there have been chytridiomycosis outbreaks, Bd could be a potential threat given the species‚Äô limited distribution and low genetic variation (see below). It is necessary to supplement with data from the distribution in Argentina, in addition to establishing a monitoring program in the medium and long term (D. V√°squez pers. comm. December 2017).","An intensive survey conducted in January 2008 (V. Corbal√°n, G. Debandi and F. Mart√≠nez unpubl. data) recorded 350 metamorphosed individuals (juveniles and adults) and approximately 1,000 tadpoles of different ages along the four main streams where it is known from&#160;in Argentina.&#160;At that time the estimated metamorphosed population did not exceed 500 individuals. In December 2008, the courses of three streams were modified by paving work, with the consequent drying of the original streams and mortality of individuals, including metamorphosed individuals and tadpoles at different developmental stages (c. 25% of the total population). More recently, surveys conducted in January 2016 revealed a lower number of observed individuals, as well as, the absence of individuals in previously occupied ponds because of the trampling and defecation by cattle (V. Corbal√°n pers. comm. September 2017). Between March 2017 and January 2018, 88 dehydrated, dead individuals have been recorded along National Route 145 and inside percolating chambers (W. Prado pers. comm. March 2017, V. Corbal√°n pers. comm. February 2018, BIOTA 2018).Correa et al. (2013) surveyed Chilean sites. These authors observed c. 20 adults in the space of one hour over 30 m of stream in one locality, and six individuals over the space of 15 min and 40 m of stream in the second locality they surveyed (Correa et al. 2013). In 2017, 25 adults and a few tadpoles of medium and small sizes were observed in a stream near Paso Pehuenche (Correa&#160;et al.&#160;2018). However, in the three streams close to Laguna del Maule, no more than 10 adults and/or tadpoles per site were observed (Correa&#160;et al.&#160;2018). In the two new sites in Caj√≥n Lo Aguirre, over 25 adults, many juveniles and numerous tadpoles of different sizes were observed per site (Correa&#160;et al.&#160;2018). Also, the second locality from Correa et al. 2013 was visited and 20 adults and a few tadpoles were observed (Correa&#160;et al.&#160;2018). All sites were explored in 2017, with a sampling effort of up to three hr/site. It is important to note that these observations were made at night, when the activity of the species is greater (D.V√°squez and C. Correa pers. comm. December 2017).The population is considered to be severely fragmented on the basis that at least 50% of the population is in isolated and fragmented patches and the species has a low capacity for dispersal, assumed from its small size, alleged site fidelity, strong dependence on water, such that it is not possible to move between patches (V. Corbal√°n pers. comm. September 2017).&#160;Population genetics analyses were conducted in 2017, at seven sites in Chile (including localities reported in Correa et al. 2013), with a total of 152 non-invasive individual samples (DNA from buccal swabs). Two different genetic markers were used (from both portions of the genome): mitochondrial DNA (control region) and 26 microsatellite fragments (D. V√°squez et al. unpubl. data). The mtDNA analysis shows extremely low values of genetic diversity at the intrapopulation level. The mtDNA data show only three haplotypes (variants) and suggest that all known localities of the species in Chile can be considered as one biological population. The microsatellite analysis supports the hypothesis of low genetic diversity at the intrapopulation level found with mitochondrial data and analysis suggest two genetics units, the stream of Caj√≥n Lo Aguirre and the streams near the Laguna del Maule and Paso Pehuenche (Correa&#160;et al.&#160;2018).&#160;It remains to be assessed whether there is genetic separation between localities in the western Andean slopes (Chile) and eastern Andean slopes (Argentina). Therefore, it is necessary to compare these results with subpopulations of this species in Argentina, and to carry out more explorations to the north and south of their distribution to identify additional subpopulations (D. V√°squez pers. comm. December 2017).",Decreasing,"This species is known from several streams in the Pehuenche Valley near National Route 145, in Malarg√ºe Department, Mendoza Province, Argentina, close to the international border with Chile (Corbal√°n et al. 2010), between 2,000-2,523 m asl, and from two geographical localities in the Regi√≥n del Maule, Chile,&#160;one of them near the localities from Argentina and the other one near the Laguna del Maule,&#160;within 5 km in a straight line from the border with Argentina (Corbal√°n et al.&#160;2010, Correa et al.&#160;2013,&#160;V. Corbal√°n pers. comm. September 2017). It has recently been reported in six other streams: one near Paso Pehuenche (Corbal√°n et al. 2010) and five new sites, three of them near Laguna del Maule and two not connected directly to Laguna del Maule (Caj√≥n Lo Aguirre), with a range extension of 14.5 km to the west from the second locality reported in Correa et al. 2013 (Correa et al. 2018). All streams inhabited by the species on&#160;the Argentinean side are crossed by the National Route N. 145 highways (Corbal√°n et al. 2010).However, the known range of this frog remains extremely restricted. This species, due to its aquatic habits, only occupies streams and contiguous swamps (Corbal√°n et al. 2010, C. Correa and D. V√°squez, pers. comm. December 2017), so its Area of Occupancy (AOO) is probably much less than its Extent of Occurrence (EOO). Its AOO is currently estimated at c. 32 km2, based on number of locality data points overlapping with cells of a 4 km2 grid,&#160;although this is likely to be an over-estimation.Also, it is important to note that there is ongoing decline of its AOO and loss of occupied ponds associated with a decrease in water quality where the species inhabits (V. Corbal√°n pers. comm. September 2017). While it is possible that it could also be found in streams in relatively inaccessible areas 8 km north and 3 km east of its current distribution in Argentina, its presence there is so far unverified (V. Corbal√°n, G. Debandi and F. Mart√≠nez pers. comm. July 2012). Therefore, based on the current known distribution, its EOO is 95 km2.",There are no records of this species being utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation ActionsThis species does not occur in any protected area. From 2007 to date the Argentinean environmental authorities have been informed about this frog's risk of extinction as a result of paving the road, and mitigation actions have been proposed (Corbal√°n et al. 2010). A monitoring programme was set up to control water quality, as well as the regular screenings for chytrid fungus to determine its potential effect on this species (Corbal√°n&#160;et al. 2010), however this program was discontinued due to the lack of funds and commitment of the authorities of Mendoza Province (V. Corbal√°n pers. comm. September 2017).&#160;During 2016-2017, a study focusing on geographic distribution, pathogen presence and population genetics was undertaken to identify research and conservation actions needed (D.

The establishment of an outreach program to increase knowledge of this species and its habitat in both Chile and Argentina is needed.Among the most important recommendations are the need to create and/or maintain: 1) the unaltered flow of water in the existing streams, 2) build wildlife passages below the route in order to promote connectivity for the frogs and other wildlife; 3) an effective drainage system to prevent salt and pollutants from draining into and altering the water quality of the streams, while also preventing frogs from becoming trapped in chambers, 4) a wire around the perimeter of ‚Äã‚Äãthe streams to prevent access of livestock to breeding sites, and 5) improved regulation of waste in the area, especially after binational meetings (BIOTA 2018).Research NeededBi-national collaborative research is needed to investigate questions relating to population size, dispersal ability, potential impact of livestock impact, chytrid fungus and climate change.",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

In previous decades sulfur mining was a threat within the area, but that has since ceased (C. Soto pers. comm. March 2017). It is possible that the water rights belong to a mining company (as happens with all water rights in the area), and one of the largest copper mines in Chile (second producer in the world - Company Collahuasi) is located 20 km northwest from the site that this species occurs, so it is possible that water extraction occurs (C. Soto pers. comm. March 2017). Water is extremely scarce in the area, and there has been observations of crude water abstraction equipment in this locality although not in use (C. Soto pers. comm.

An introduced goat population, once estimated at 80,000 animals, caused major degradation of tortoise habitat.&#160;Goats were eradicated in 2003 and the vegetation began to recover.&#160;However, the absence of goats resulted in the spread of&#160;invasive non-native vegetation, particularly&#160;blackberry and, to a lesser extent, naranjilla and avocado.

530,South America,Chelonoidis hoodensis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,TESTUDINES,REPTILIA,TESTUDINIDAE,Chelonoidis,hoodensis,A1bde," The Espa√±ola tortoise experienced a historical population collapse primarily caused by targeted exploitation, followed by habitat degradation resulting from introduced goats, within the three most recent generations (generation time 60 years), from an estimated historical population of 2,400 to 14 adults left on the island by the 1960s (a 99% reduction). All 14 adults (plus one male later found at the San Diego Zoo) were taken to the Tortoise Centre on Santa Cruz Island to begin a breeding program. The genetic diversity of the 15 tortoises is lower than that found in other Gal√°pagos tortoise populations, suggesting that the Espa√±ola population had been low for some time and had undergone a previous bottleneck. Following more than 30 years of repatriating juvenile tortoises, the population was estimated in 2007 at 770‚Äì864 tortoises, including both repatriates and their offspring (Gibbs et al. 2014), a ca 67% reduction from historical levels. The population is genetically depauperate, and the effective genetic population size of bottlenecked cohort is less than eight, with all of the tortoises on the island either F1 or F2 offspring of the 15 founders&#160;(Milinkovitch et&#160;al. 2003, 2007, 2013).&#160;In addition, not all of the genetic diversity found in the 15 founders is present in the F1 population. The population change over the past three generations amounts to a &gt; 90% reduction in effective adult population, qualifying the species as Critically Endangered, CR A1bde.&#160;Chelonoidis hoodensis&#160;was assessed (at the subspecies level), as Critically Endangered D (population &lt; 50 mature individuals) on the 1996 IUCN Red List. This assessment also incorporates contributions from&#160;the international workshop on&#160;Gal√°pagos tortoises&#160;convened by the Gal√°pagos National Park Directorate&#160;in July 2012.  &#160; ","Chelonoidis hoodensis&#160;is a saddlebacked tortoise adapted for browsing on cacti and other higher-growing vegetation in drier shrubland ecosystems.&#160;Based on first successful in situ reproduction, in 1990, of reintroduced animals born in captivity as early as&#160;1971,&#160;age at first reproduction is approximately&#160;20 years, and generation time is estimated at 60 years."," Historical overexploitation of tortoises for human consumption has been the most significant impact on the Espa√±ola tortoise. Further impacts were suffered by the introduction of goats (which competed for food with tortoises and affected vegetation regeneration structure). Goats were&#160;eradicated from Espa√±ola in 1978.&#160;Their long-term impact, along with the absence of giant tortoises, however, has resulted in dense thickets of woody vegetation at a level not evident for the last 500-1000 years, making it difficult for tortoises to disperse to all of their historical range (Gibbs et al. 2014). Espa√±ola is a small island, with a small area suitable for tortoises, placing them at risk of weather catastrophes. The island is particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. Espa√±ola has a low cactus population density (a result of the long-term presence of goats), which impacts the tortoises, as&#160;Opuntia&#160;cactus is an important resource for tortoises. The risk of future goat, rat, or other (re-)introductions remains. A second population of Espa√±ola tortoises is currently being established on Santa F√© Island, to replace the undescribed native species that went extinct in the mid-1800s and to recover the ecological functions once provided by giant tortoises there. The Espa√±ola tortoise is the species genetically and morphologically closest to the original Santa F√© tortoise (Poulakakis et al. 2012). This second subpopulation of Chelonoidis hoodensis on Santa F√© will serve as an insurance colony for this species.&#160;"," Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-human population size was estimated to have been about 2,400 adults (J.P. Gibbs unpubl. data). By the 1960s, the total global population was known to be 15 mature adult animals, 12 females and three males (one was located at the San Diego Zoo and returned to Gal√°pagos in 1977). An intensive conservation breeding and re-introduction program has subsequently increased the population: nearly 1,900 have been repatriated and of those approximately 50% survive (Gibbs et al. 2014). &#160;A total of&#160;1,837&#160;animals have been reintroduced to Espa√±ola since 1975; reproduction by the reintroduced animals was first observed on the island in 1990 (M√°rquez et al. 1991). Most recent survey data (2010) estimate about 700 animals at Tunas/Caco in the central part of the island, and an additional 100 animals inland of Gardner Bay, about 800 in total. Given that about half of all repatriated animals survive, many have now reached reproductive age. Estimates for the current population vary from 11-20%comprised of &#160;in situ recruitment, thus repatriated animals make up 80-89% of the&#160;in situ&#160;population.&#160;The success of this program is also demonstrated by genetic&#160;analyses which indicate that while none of the tortoises sampled in 1994 had hatched on the island, of those tested in 2004 and 2007, 3%&#160;and 24% were&#160;in situ hatchlings , respectively (Milinkovitch et al. 2013).&#160;The recovery of this population despite its extremely low effective population size is probably due to Espa√±ola tortoises having been subjected to population bottlenecks at different points in time prior to the arrival of humans in the Archipelago, rather than a single drastic reduction in recent times (Garrick et&#160;al. 2012). These declines may have been related to environmental fluctuations, which may have led to purging of deleterious recessive alleles improving the long-term survival prospects of the repatriated population (Milinkovitch et al. 2013). Nearly 400 juvenile Chelonoidis hoodensis have also been introduced to the island of Santa F√© [Barrington], previously inhabited by an undescribed extinct tortoise species. ",Increasing,"Chelonoidis hoodensis occurs on Espa√±ola Island [formerly Hood Island] in the&#160;Gal√°pagos&#160;Islands of Ecuador. Espa√±ola has a total surface area of 60.5 sq.km, of which 6 sq. km (10%) is currently occupied by tortoises and 24 sq.km (40%) could potentially sustain tortoises.","Completely overexploited for human consumption in the 19th century.

It has been included in Appendix I of CITES since 1975, prohibiting all forms of commercial international trade. All of Espa√±ola Island, and thus the entire&#160;native range of&#160;C.&#160;hoodensis, is protected as part of the Gal√°pagos National Park. Continued efforts are needed to manage and monitor the recovery of the&#160;population&#160;in situ.&#160;Genetic research has demonstrated that the diversity of the repatriates could be increased through selected mating pairs/groups; new breeding groups were established in 2017 for this purpose.&#160;The genetic diversity among the 15 breeders is low (compared to other Gal√°pagos tortoise species), i.e., the population has been inbred for a long time already and probably experienced repeated population fluctuations (Garrick et al. 2012;&#160;Milinkovitch et al. 2013). Effective genetic population size is 5-8 animals. Improved genetic management of P1 is needed.&#160;Goats were eradicated from Espa√±ola in 1978. However, as a result of the goats and the concurrent absence of tortoises, there is need for habitat management (reducing dense thickets of woody vegetation and expanding the cactus population). Therefore, tortoise repatriations have been suspended for the next ten years.&#160;During that time, juvenile Espa√±ola tortoises produced in the Tortoise Centre on Santa Cruz Island have been released onto Santa Fe Island, where tortoises (similar in morphology and genetics) went extinct in the mid-1800s.&#160;Not only does this restore a tortoise population on Santa F√©, it provides a back-up population of Espa√±ola tortoises in case of some catastrophe on Espa√±ola.

531,South America,Chelonoidis porteri,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,TESTUDINES,REPTILIA,TESTUDINIDAE,Chelonoidis,porteri,A2bde," The historical population estimate is 35,000 animals for the western Santa Cruz population (within and surrounding the current Tortoise Reserve, or ‚ÄúLa Reserva‚Äù) (J.P. Gibbs unpubl. data), before the extensive exploitation in the 19th&#160;century (less than three generations ago, at generation length of 60 years). This&#160;population is currently estimated at about 3,400 animals (Gibbs, unpubl. data, 2010), indicating a three-generation decline rate of over 90%, and its ongoing recovery remains&#160;compromised&#160;by the impacts of introduced predators (pigs, black rats, fire ants), invasive vegetation, agricultural land use, barriers to migratory routes, and occasional human-related mortality (consumption, roadkill). For the Western&#160;Santa Cruz tortoise population,&#160;a historical decline of over 90% is realistic, and the population qualifies as Critically Endangered, CR A2bde. ""Chelonoidis nigra&#160;ssp.&#160;porteri""&#160;was previously assessed in the 1996 IUCN Red List&#160;as Endangered C2a (&lt;2,500 adults, in decline, fragmented, no subpopulation larger than 250 adults), but at that time also included the eastern Santa Crux population at Cerro Fatal, now separated as the newly described species C. donfaustoi (Poulakakis et al. 2015). This assessment also incorporates knowledge contributions from&#160;the international workshop on&#160;Gal√°pagos tortoises&#160;convened by the Gal√°pagos National Park Directorate&#160;in July 2012. ","Chelonoidis porteri&#160;is a large tortoise with a dome-shaped carapace; it feeds predominantly on low-growing vegetation. As occurs in other Gal√°pagos tortoise taxa, first reproduction likely occurs after 20 years of age, and a generation time of 60 years is estimated.&#160;Higher elevation areas are dominated by males and some females, middle elevation areas by males, females and some juveniles, and lower elevation areas by females and juveniles. Adult tortoises migrate up and down the elevation gradient, with movements timed to short, rainfall-driven bursts in lowland plant productivity. Nests occur between 6-149 m above sea level, in the hottest, driest and least productive part of the tortoise range. Nest temperature and egg survival declines with increasing elevation whereas hatchling survival and growth are highest at intermediate elevations. Hatchlings disperse between 100-600 m from their nests before becoming sedentary in ranges typically &lt;0.04 ha (Blake et al. 2012, unpubl. data).","As well as the severe declines suffered as a result of historical overexploitation for consumption by sailors and later settlers,&#160;the Chelonoidis porteri&#160;population has also been impacted by the effects of introduced vegetation, introduced goats, donkeys and other herbivores competing with it for food and altering vegetation dynamics, and introduced rats, cats, dogs, pigs, and ants preying on its eggs, hatchlings, and juveniles. Much of the upper sector of the species‚Äô current range has been converted to agriculture and pastureland.&#160;While pastures may provide tortoises with nutritious forage, human encroachment, particularly where tortoise migration routes are disrupted by fences and roads, remains a cause for concern (Blake et al. 2015). As the population expands into new areas, there are more tortoises entering roadways and there have been several instances of tortoises being hit by cars. A potential future threat could arise due to current demands by some local stakeholders to open more trails into the park on the western side of Santa Cruz (for example an alternative trail to Tortuga Bay and a possible trail from the highlands to the coast near Eden Island). These efforts could cause serious problems for this tortoise population ‚Äì both in terms of an increase of tortoises on the roads and greater access of humans to tortoise areas."," Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-human population size of the population of&#160;Chelonoidis porteri&#160;was estimated as 35,000 adult animals (J.P. Gibbs unpubl. data). Following historical depletion, the&#160;population was estimated at 2,000-3,000 animals in the early 1970s (MacFarland et al. 1974) and 3,400&#160;in 2010 (J.P. Gibbs unpubl. data). Based on these estimates, the Western Santa Cruz Tortoise population currently&#160;comprises less than 10 percent of its original size, with a population decrease of &gt;90%.&#160; Recruitment and population growth continue to be impacted by depredation of nests by pigs, but the work of the Gal√°pagos National Park protecting nests over the last several decades is beginning to show some success. While small tortoises are difficult to find, many young adult tortoises (perhaps 20-30 years old) are beginning to show up in farmlands and alongside roads where they have not been seen in decades. A more complete survey of this apparently expanding population is needed.  ",Increasing,"Chelonoidis porteri occurs on the southwestern slopes of Santa Cruz Island [formerly Indefatigable Island] in the Gal√°pagos Islands of Ecuador. Santa Cruz has a total surface area of 980 sq. km, of which approximately 141 sq. km currently supports the western Santa Cruz tortoise and 500 sq. km. likely could sustain a fully recovered population.",Chelonoidis porteri was historically overexploited for consumption by settlers and sailors (Pritchard 1996).,Terrestrial," Legislation and regulation:&#160;Chelonoidis porteri&#160;is protected under Ecuadorian national law. It has been included in Appendix I of CITES since 1975, prohibiting all forms of commercial international trade. Most (84%) of Santa Cruz Island, including much of the&#160;native range of&#160;C.&#160;porteri,&#160;is protected as part of the Gal√°pagos National Park. However, tortoises migrate into the highlands, which is now predominantly an agriculture zone, and sometimes spend months there. Progress has been made with the eradication of goats and donkeys on Santa Cruz, and preventing future increases in these populations is vital. Pigs, the predator that causes the most destruction of tortoise nests, are regularly controlled in the nesting zones, but the population remains a threat. Park rangers also protect nests with fencing to prevent access by pigs.&#160;Recent evidence of fire ants (Solenopsis) preying on tortoise hatchlings is cause for concern. Barriers to tortoise migration need to be reduced while controlling the remaining livestock, by engaging farmers in the use of raised barbed wire and other barrier alternatives to closed fencing. In recent years, as the tortoise population grows, more tortoises are showing up on roads and in farms where they were previously absent; this has resulted in some tortoises being hit by cars. Research needs include understanding the ecological impacts of migrations and human impacts on these migrations; understanding how tortoises contribute to dispersal of invasive plants; developing control of Solenopsis&#160;in tortoise nesting zones, and determining if there are critical areas for habitat management, particularly&#160;removal of&#160;invasive&#160;woody vegetation. Socioeconomic research on how best to mediate human-tortoise conflict is also needed. The resilience of C. porteri&#160; in the face of future environmental change will be maximized by ensuring the quality and connectivity of foraging and nesting areas both within and beyond the current and possible future elevational range occupied by the tortoises.

While there is no direct information available, it is suspected that&#160;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&#160;has caused the declines observed in this species, and if a population still exists it is probably not greater than 50 mature individuals. Furthermore,&#160;its estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 10 km2,&#160;it is only known from one threat-defined location, and there is continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat due to&#160;logging, agriculture activities including illegal crops and mining activities throughout its small range.","This species is from lowland rainforest, occurring in primary forest and found in rocks near brooks and streams. It breeds by direct development.","Major threats include habitat loss and degradation caused by logging, agriculture activities including illegal crops, and gold mining activities throughout its small range. The habitat at the type locality is completely destroyed (G. Gonzalez pers. comm. 2018).&#160;While there is currently no direct information confirming that chytrid has caused declines in this species, the lack of records during the 1990s is consistent with the pattern of decline in many other montane stream-associated anurans (e.g.,&#160;Pristimantis diaphonus,&#160;P.&#160;lichenoides, and&#160;P. bernali), and it is therefore reasonable to infer that the disease might be the cause of past declines in this species.","The species is known from only eight specimens collected 1986. There have been numerous surveys at the type locality and surrounding areas during the 1990s, and also in 2008 and 2010 (G. Gonzalez pers. comm. July 2018), but the species has not been recorded. The area is reasonably difficult and dangerous to access due to the presence of armed groups, illegal crops, and illegal mining (G. Gonzalez pers. comm. July 2018). It is possible that this species is extinct (G. Gonzalez pers. comm. July 2018), however if a population does exist it is likely to be very small and is probably less than 50 mature individuals.",Unknown,"This species is only known from a one threat-defined location in single stream in Alto de Oso, on the western flank of the Cordillera Occidental, in Choc√≥ department, Colombia, at 950 m asl. It is thought that this species is range-restricted and is not likely to have an extent of occurrence greater than 10 km2.",There are no records of this species being utilized.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation ActionsThis species has not been recorded in any protected areas.

The habitat downstream of the reservoir is not suitable for this species, although the reach upstream extends up to 4,300 m asl and could be used by the species for reproduction (Catenazzi et al. 2015).","The population is suspected to be decreasing due to ongoing decline in the quality and extent of its habitat, and there is likely an ongoing decline of mature individuals due to chytridiomycosis.&#160;In October 2012, three observers searched 100 m of a stream reach for 60 min and encountered 43 tadpoles, one juvenile, and seven adults (Catenazzi et al. 2015).",Decreasing,"This species is known only from the type locality: Chicchobamba,&#160;a stream tributary of the Huaytar√° river,&#160;which is in the upper&#160;drainage of the Pisco River watershed, Huaytar√° Province, Region of Huancavelica, in central Peru, where it occurs at 3,900 m asl. In the case of extent of occurrence (EOO), the lower bound is 16 km2, representing a minimum convex polygon of the species' estimated geographic range based on known records and immediate suitable habitat. The valley of the type locality and adjacent valleys are dominated by arid environments that likely limit dispersal of this species, thus it is very likely that it is endemic to the upper Pisco watershed and adjacent river basins (Catenazzi et al. 2015). Hence, it is thought that this species is unlikely to have an EOO greater than 20,000 km2 (A. Catenazzi pers. comm.

This population is currently estimated at about 400 animals (~250 adults), indicating a three-generation decline rate of about 97%; there are also an additional 97 juveniles being reared at the Gal√°pagos National Park Directorate‚Äôs Tortoise Centre on Santa Cruz. The ongoing recovery of this population remains restrained due to impacts of introduced predators (feral pigs, Black Rats), invasive vegetation, agricultural land use, disturbance of migratory routes, and occasional human-related mortality (consumption, roadkill), qualifying it as Critically Endangered, CR A2abce. In addition, its extent of occurrence (EOO) is &lt;100 sq. km in a single population, with an ongoing reduction in area of occupnacy (AOO), qualifying it also for CR B1ab(ii).&#160;Chelonoidis donfaustoi&#160;was considered a part of&#160;C. porteri&#160;before its description as a new species in 2015 (Poulakakis et al. 2015).&#160;Chelonoidis nigra&#160;ssp.&#160;porteri&#160;was assessed as EN C2a on the 1996 IUCN Red List&#160;(&lt;2,500 adults, in decline, fragmented, no subpopulation larger than 250 adults), and the restricted&#160;C. porteri&#160;is currently assessed as CR A2bce.","Chelonoidis donfaustoi&#160;is a large tortoise with dome-shaped carapace. As occurs in other Gal√°pagos tortoise taxa, first reproduction likely occurs after 20 years of age, and a generation time of 60 years is estimated.&#160;Tortoises migrate between higher and lower elevation areas depending on seasonal availability of vegetation and suitable nesting sites in the lower elevation areas near the coast; higher elevation areas are dominated by males and some females, middle elevation areas by males, females and some juveniles, and lower elevation areas by females and juveniles (Blake et al. 2012). In recent years, &#160;due to changes in habitat and migratory routes, some juveniles are being observed in the highlands.","As well as the severe declines suffered as a result of historical overexploitation for consumption by sailors and later settlers,&#160;Chelonoidis donfaustoi&#160;has also been reduced by the effects of introduced vegetation altering its habitat, introduced goats and donkeys competing with it for food and altering vegetation dynamics, and introduced rats, cats, dogs, pigs, and ants preying on its eggs, hatchlings, and juveniles. Much of the upper sector of the species‚Äô current range has been converted to agriculture and pastureland.&#160;While pastures that dominate may provide tortoises with nutritious forage, human encroachment, particularly where tortoise migration routes are disrupted by fences and roads, remain cause for concern (Blake et al. 2015). Moreover this species harbours very low levels of genetic diversity, which severely impacts its capacity to rapidly adapt to changing conditions (Beheregaray et al. 2003, Russello et al. 2005, Poulakakis et al. 2015).","The pre-human population size of tortoises at Cerro Fatal was estimated to have been about 13,500 adults (Gibbs, unpubl. data). None of the estimates made between 1960 and 2000, ranging from 23 to over 600, can be considered accurate. &#160;The current estimate is approximately 400 individuals, with an estimated 250 adults, a 97% decline. A complete population census is planned for 2017 or 2018.",Increasing," Chelonoidis donfaustoi&#160;is only found on the eastern side of Santa Cruz Island (Gal√°pagos Islands, Ecuador) extending from the moist highlands to the dry lowlands with range centred around Cerro Fatal, occupying an area currently estimated at about 40 sq. km. ",The tortoises on Santa Cruz&#160;were historically overexploited for consumption by sailors and early settlers (Pritchard 1996).&#160;Hunting of these tortoises by local residents continued throughout the first half of the 20th century.,Terrestrial,"Legislation and regulation:&#160;Chelonoidis donfaustoi&#160;is protected under Ecuadorian national law. It has been included in Appendix I of CITES since 1975 (as Testudinidae spp.), prohibiting all forms of commercial international trade. Most (84%) of Santa Cruz Island, including approximately 95% of the&#160;native range of&#160;C.&#160;donfaustoi,&#160;is protected as part of the Galapagos National Park. However, tortoises migrate into the agriculture zone and sometimes spend months there. Progress has been made with the eradication of goats and donkeys on Santa Cruz, and preventing future increases in these populations is vital. Pigs, the predator that causes the most destruction of tortoise nests throughout Santa Cruz, are regularly controlled in the nesting zones, but the population remains a threat. Park rangers also protect nests with fencing to prevent access by pigs.&#160;Recent evidence of fire ants (Solenopsis) preying on tortoise hatchlings is of even more concern. Barriers to tortoise migration need to be reduced while controlling the remaining livestock, by engaging farmers in the use of raised barbed wire and other barrier alternatives to closed fencing. Research needs include understanding the ecological impacts of migrations and human impacts on these migrations; understanding how tortoises contribute to dispersal of invasive plants; developing control of&#160;Solenopsis&#160;in tortoise nesting zones, and determining if there are critical areas for habitat management, particularly&#160;removal of&#160;invasive&#160;woody vegetation. Socioeconomic research would also be useful on how best to mediate the limited human-tortoise conflict that occurs in the farm zone; as the tortoise population grows and expands further into farmland, this will become of greater concern. .",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Its small subpopulations are suspected to suffer ongoing declines owing to deforestation within a severely fragmented habitat and increasing impacts of climate change. Consequently it qualifies as Critically Endangered.  ","It inhabits humid and wet cloud forest, and especially high-Andean montane forest, including elfin forest and forest borders at 1,700-3,500 m (Jahn 2008, Jahn &amp; Santander 2008). It is uncertain whether historical records at up to 4,700 m are due to mislabelling or whether they indicate that habitat structure and plant species composition of p√°ramos has considerably changed over the last century (O. Jahn in litt. 2007, Jahn and Santander 2008). Black-breasted Puffleg historically seemed to be most numerous between 2,400-3,050 m from April to September and above 3,100 m from November to February during the presumed breeding season. In recent years, most records were obtained between 2,850 and 3,500 m, with dispersing immatures occurring as low as 1,700 m (Santander et al. 2004, Lyons and Santander 2006, Jahn 2008, Jahn and Santander 2008). It has recently been recorded along bushy forest edges along road sides, steep slopes with stunted vegetation and from taller montane forest interiors and clearings (Bleiweiss and Olalla 1983, Santander et al. 2004, Jahn 2008, Jahn and Santander 2008). However recent research suggests that the species may avoid forest edge habitats; areas where Black-breasted Puffleg were present were typically further from forest edge than plots where the species was absent (Guevara et al. 2015). Although it is more of a generalist than previously reported, seasonal altitudinal migrations are thought to be determined by the seasonal flowering of specific vines and species such as fuchsias and ericaceous trees (Bleiweiss and Olalla 1983). It prefers Palicourea huigrensis flowers (Heynen et al. 2015). It has been recorded using 29 different species of food-plants, thus it is not believed to be restricted in range owing to dietary constraints (Santander et al. 2004, Jahn 2008, Jahn and Santander 2008, Guevara et al. 2015). Eight of the 29 species belong to the Ericaceae family (Guevara et al. 2015).&#160;","The main threat is the felling of forest for timber and charcoal, facilitating the introduction of cattle and the eventual spread of the agricultural frontier for ranching and to a lesser extent production of crops (Phillips 1998, Santander et al. 2004, Jahn 2008). In Canton Cotacachi, Imbabura, 45% of households still use firewood and charcoal for cooking and heating, contributing to the destruction of key habitat (Jahn and Santander 2008). The situation is similar on the west slope of Volc√°n Pichincha, where some families still produce charcoal for auto-consumption and commercialisation in Quito (Jahn &amp; Santander 2008). Suitable habitat on ridge-crests is disappearing more rapidly than surrounding vegetation, because the crests provide flat ground for cultivating potatoes and livestock-grazing within otherwise steep terrain (Bleiweiss and Olalla 1983). The Tois√°n population is threatened by rapid deforestation on the south-west slope of the cordillera, copper mining concessions, and invasions of landless farmers within the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve (Jahn 2008, Jahn and Santander 2008). Some ridges where it formerly occurred are now almost completely devoid of natural vegetation, and even if it still occurs in these areas it is unlikely to be numerous. Around 93 % of the suitable habitat within its probable historic range has been degraded or destroyed (Williams and Santander 2003), with 97 % lost in Pinchincha Province (Santander et al. 2004). Human-induced fires threaten large tracts of forest during the dry season (Jahn 2008). The construction of a pipeline at Cerro Chiquilipe led to habitat destruction for the pipeline itself, an access road and a depressurisation station despite the known presence of the hummingbird (Santander et al. 2004). Volc√°n Pichincha has sporadically erupted since 1999, and ash-fall in the area has been considerable. The impacts of this on the species and its habitat are unknown. Climate change in the future may push the climate zone for this species above the current treeline (Jahn 2008), and could lead to increased competition with Gorgeted Sunangel Heliangelus strophianus as that species expands its altitudinal range (Jahn 2008, Guevara 2013). However, the current treeline is thought to be lower than it was historically owing to centuries of anthropogenic stresses (particularly fire) causing the gradual loss and fragmentation of high altitude forest (Jahn 2008). ","The population is estimated to number 210-268 individuals, roughly equating to 140-180 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is found seasonally on the northern and north-western ridge-crests of Volc√°n Pichincha, Pichincha, and in the Cordillera de Tois√°n above the Int√°g valley, Esmeraldas and Imbabura, north-west Ecuador. The large number of museum specimens (over 100) suggests it was formerly more common, but the only confirmed record between 1950 and 1993 was of three individuals in 1980. It has clearly declined and is now rare within a very limited range (Phillips 1998). On Volc√°n Pichincha, the area of suitable habitat where the species is known to occur has been dramatically reduced to c.34 km2, and supports an estimated 160 individuals. However, it may also occur on the unstudied western slope of the volcano where additional habitat remains. In 2006, a small population was rediscovered in the Cordillera de Tois√°n above the Int√°g valley. It may still occur on Volc√°n Atacazo, but the only confirmed evidence concerns three specimens from 1898, with a possible sighting in 1983. Recent searches on Atacazo resulted in one unconfirmed report (C. Devenish in litt. 2010). Searches in May-July 2013 only located single females at Cuchilla de Verdecocha and Yanacocha, with an additional (unphotographed) record of a male and female at Cascada Guagrapamba (Aves y Conservaci√≥n 2013). Available records suggest that it is an altitudinal migrant, but its movements remain poorly understood and appear to have changed since it was first collected (Jahn 2008). ",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. Media coverage of research on the species and threats to its habitat has encouraged the authorities to control access and forbid charcoal production at Yanacocha (Phillips 1998). The species was designated the 'emblematic bird of Quito' in 2005. The area was subsequently purchased by the Jocotoco Foundation and protects c. 1,000 ha of key habitat for the species. An additional 26 ha has been purchased adjacent to the reserve for reforestation (of native cloudforest) for a carbon offsetting scheme by Bird Holidays, a birdwatching tour company (Anon. 2006). The neighbouring private reserve Hacienda Verdecocha protects an additional 1,200 ha of optimal habitat. A large part of the unexplored primary forest of Volc√°n Pichincha's western slopes are protected by Bosque Protector Mindo-Nambillo reserve (Jahn 2008). Western slopes of the Cordillera de Tois√°n are protected within the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve (Jahn 2008). A Species Action Plan was developed in 2007 and published in 2008 (Jahn &amp; Santander 2008), with a Spanish translation completed by 2012 (Aves y Conservaci√≥n 2012). The Species Guardian, Aves &amp; Conservaci√≥n, have carried out capacity building activities for nature and community tourism in the Alaspungo community since 2008 (Aves &amp; Conservaci√≥n in litt. 2009, 2010, Aves y Conservaci√≥n 2012) including training of community-based guides. Other actions so far have included a community and stakeholder outreach programme in Pichincha province, the formation of a Local Conservation Group, production and distribution of environmental education materials, reforestation activities on cattle pastures and other degraded lands on the Hacienda Verdecocha and Yanacocha Reserves and initiation of a standardised bird monitoring programme. Plans to designate the Alaspungo Community Forest as a protected area evolved into the creation of a larger 8,000 ha municipal protected area (Nono-Pich√°n-Alambi Conservation and Sustainable Use Area), including the Community Forest. The resulting plan was being reviewed by the municipality in 2012, and once approved will pave the way for the formal creation of the reserve (Aves y Conservaci√≥n 2012). Monitoring along set transects at the Community Forest was scheduled to be initiated in August 2013. In May 2013 Aves y Conservaci√≥n initiated a project aiming to document the ecological requirements of the species at landscape and microhabitat level.Conservation Actions ProposedExpand awareness campaigns to other areas, particularly the √çntag valley and the Volc√°n Atacazo (Jahn &amp; Santander 2008). Implement recently-developed management plans to improve protection of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve and the Protective Forest Mindo-Nambillo through law enforcement against illegal logging, hunting, and colonisation inside the reserves, and sustainable management projects in their buffer zones (Jahn and Santander 2008).

Provide local people with alternative incomes that do not damage the species's habitat (Santander et al. 2004, Jahnand&amp; Santander 2008), and develop and implement an endowment fund strategy for conservation easements (Jahn &amp; Santander 2008). Continue to reforest degraded lands and re-establish biological corridors to guarantee connectivity between remnant forest fragments and continuous habitat (Santander et al. 2004, Jahn and Santander 2008), ensuring forest tract connectivity between the altitudinal extremes of the range (Guevara 2013). Pre-emptively restore native woody vegetation in at least 30% of grass p√°ramo within the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve, Volc√°n Pichincha, and Volc√°n Atacazo over the next 25 years in anticipation of future climate change (Jahn 2008, Jahn &amp; Santander 2008). Monitor changes in habitat on a five-yearly basis (Jahn and Santander 2008). Carry out studies on feeder-transmitted diseases (Jahn and Santander 2008). Research minimum forest patch size required by the species and use remote sensing to identify suitable habitat corridors that should be protected (Guevara et al. 2015).

It lays its eggs on the ground, and the males carry the tadpoles to streams (Coloma 1995) or partially drained ponds where they develop further (Y√°nez-Mu√±oz&#160;et al. 2010).&#160;Higher activity has been observed during rainy season between December and May (Y√°nez-Mu√±oz&#160;et al.&#160;2010).","Habitat destruction and degradation is a significant threat to this species, due mainly to agriculture, including livestock ranching, and logging. Destruction of a single marsh could largely destroy the population of this species; the marsh is unprotected (Ecuador Red List Assessment Workshop July 2016). It is possible that this species has been impacted by chytridiomycosis, which has been confirmed in one of the historical samples analyzed (Y√°nes-Mu√±oz et al. 2010).","This is a strongly cryptic species, which makes it difficult to find and capture (Y√°nez-Mu√±oz and&#160;Meza-Ramos&#160;2006).

If a population still exists it is thought to have fewer than 50 mature individuals.","The type locality is a forested ridge, which has a relatively low canopy and is exceedingly dense in most places. This forest is cool and very damp, with a conspicuous moss layer and many epiphytes (bromeliads) on the tree trunks. Specimens have been found by day, on or close to the ground, in the forest and in adjacent recent clearings on the slopes of Volc√°n Reventador. The eggs are laid on the ground, and the tadpoles are carried on the back of the adults one by one to bromeliads (e.g.&#160;Guzmania conifera), where they develop.","Habitat at the type locality has been cleared for agriculture and livestock farming, where pesticides including glyphosate are often used (T.R. Kahn pers. comm. In: Kahn et al. 2016). Oil and gas extraction operations in Napo province promote the building of roads and human settlement (Kahn et al. 2016). The drastic decline in this species in the mid-1980s may have been related to the synergistic effects of habitat loss, chytridiomycosis and climate change. This species is also threatened by volcanic activity from Volc√°n Reventador, where the release of toxic gases and volcanic ash (seen in moderate eruptions) and the potential pyroclastic flow (observed in major eruptions) could result in catastrophic landslides that, depending on their extent, would completely destroy the remaining forested habitat of this frog (Kahn et al. 2016).

Three-dimensional complex microhabitats with vegetated and rocky bottoms are key components for the survival of this species, which rarely uses simple, largely exposed microhabitats, such as sandy bottoms or open waters (Cuello et al. 2017b).&#160;Individuals are found in areas adjacent to the lagoons where it occurs, in aquatic and terrestrial habitat, although most often in aquatic habitat (Fox et al. 2005).&#160;It is not known from degraded habitats.The tadpole was described by Cei (1965) and internal oral features described by Wassertsug and Heyer (1988). Cei (1965) mentioned the omnivorous, probably suctorial habit of the tadpoles.&#160;Breeding is seasonal and takes place within lagoons during the spring.&#160;Tadpoles have been found throughout the year (Cuello et al. 2014), but only when the lagoons retain water all year.&#160;In permanent lagoons, tadpoles present two strategies: seasonal (short larval period; metamorphs in the same growing season) and overwintering tadpoles (long larval period, tadpoles undergoing metamorphosis the following spring). In temporary lagoons, desiccation appears to exert great pressure, with accelerated larval development,&#160;resulting in short larval periods, between spring and early autumn (Cuello&#160;et al. 2014).Postmetamorphic individuals can exhibit two morphotypes: aquatic and littoral (= terrestrial; Cei and Roig 1968). In permanent lagoons, this frog mainly exhibits the aquatic morphotype, while in temporary lagoons individuals are able to change morphology to both aquatic and terrestrial environments in response to environmental changes (Cei and Roig 1968, Cuello et al. 2008).&#160;The diets of the two morphotypes are completely different, although both are carnivorous (Cuello et al. 2006a; 2009c). The most important prey of postmetamorphic individuals in the aquatic environment are amphipods (Hyalella) and Odonata larvae, while in the terrestrial environment the preferred prey are terrestrial insects and arachnids (Cuello et al. 2006a,b; 2009c).","The main subpopulation (Laguna Blanca) was extirpated after the introduction of exotic fishes (Percichthyis sp. and salmonids). The remaining subpopulations are isolated from this lake. Introduction of predatory fishes to the remaining lakes is a potential major threat to all subpopulations.&#160;Salmonids have been found in one lagoon where this frog occurs, while in another lagoon where perch were observed (Laguna El Alamo),&#160;Atelognathus patagonicus was not found (Cuello et al. 2009b).The species is currently threatened by the degradation of its habitat caused by livestock drinking from the lagoons and grazing on the aquatic vegetation (Cuello&#160;et al. 2014, 2017b). Furthermore, the aquatic vegetation on which this species depends was severely deteriorated in all the lagoons as a consequence&#160;of the prolonged drought between 2010 and mid-2016&#160;(M.E. Cuello pers. obs.&#160;January 2017). The dramatic climatic cycles occurring in the region can act synergistically with other risk factors (M.E. Cuello pers. comm. October 2017).Fox et al. (2005) reported that most subpopulations had many dead and moribund tadpoles and frogs, all of which showed clinical signs of disease, and subsequently, ranavirus and&#160;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis were both detected in several subpopulations within Laguna Blanca National Park (Fox et al. 2006, Ghirardi et al. 2014).","The species was very abundant in&#160;Laguna Blanca&#160;until 1983 (P√©faur and Duellman 1980, Administraci√≥n de Parques Nacionales 1993), grew scarce in 1984, and from 1986 on has not been observed at that site.&#160;Hypotheses to explain this drastic population decline and its extirpation from Laguna Blanca include habitat loss, competition, and predation by perch (Percichthys colhuapiensis)&#160;(Fox et al.&#160;2005,&#160;Cuello and Perotti, 2006,&#160;Ortubay&#160;et al.&#160;2006), which were introduced to Laguna Blanca and other small lagoons that are naturally fishless (Ortubay&#160;et al.&#160;2006).&#160;Surveys of this species in 15 lakes in and around Laguna Blanca National Park at various times between 2000 and 2002 revealed relatively high densities of individuals along transects near shorelines (overall average highest density per lake of 0.58 individuals/m2;&#160;Fox et al. 2005).&#160;Subsequently, surveys using underwater traps in Laguna Verde (Laguna Blanca National Park)&#160;during 2004-2009 also revealed high densities of postmetamorphic individuals (3.93 individuals/trap in one night, January 2006) and tadpoles (8.3 individuals/trap in one night, January 2006; Cuello et al. 2017b).&#160;Similar high densities were reported in Laguna Batea (Cuello et al. 2014).Between January 2003 and&#160;March 2006, this species was found in 23 of the 28 lagoons surveyed, including the&#160;14 lagoons where it had been previously documented&#160;by Fox et al. (2005) and&#160;in nine new localities (Cuello et al. 2009b). Given the isolation of each subpopulation, the population is considered to be severely fragmented, such that there is limited or no dispersal between subpopulations. Nevertheless, Martinazzo et al. (2011) found that the diversity index observed in Atelognathus patagonicus revealed low genetic variability from the lagoons of the Laguna Blanca system.&#160;During 2010-mid 2016, all subpopulations suffered a new, drastic population decline caused by a prolonged drought, which suppressed reproduction during six years (Cuello et al. 2015, M.E. Cuello pers. comm. October 2017). Surveys performed in years during the drought did not find any individuals (M.E. Cuello pers. obs.&#160;2011‚Äì2016). Additionally, the aquatic habitat was severely deteriorated in all lagoons as a consequence of the dramatic drought (M.E. Cuello pers. comm. October 2017). By mid-2016,&#160;increased precipitation allowed the water levels to slightly recover, however the habitat was still degraded (M.E. Cuello pers. comm.&#160;October 2017). During 2017, surveys&#160;using subaquatic traps&#160;in Laguna Verde revealed densities of tadpoles and frogs&#160;much lower than those&#160;prior to the&#160;drought, c. 1% of the previous relative abundance (postmetamorphic individuals = 0.07 individuals/trap in one night and tadpoles = 0.1 individuals/trap in one night; M.E. Cuello pers. obs.&#160;January 2017). Similar low densities were registered in Laguna Anti√±ir. While this is likely to be the first stage of the recovery period (M.E. Cuello pers. comm. October 2017), the past population decline, estimated to be more than 90% over the last ten years, inferred from the observed reduction in population size and a decline in the quality of its aquatic habitat as a consequence&#160;of the prolonged drought between 2010 and mid-2016 remains a concern.",Increasing,"This species is endemic to north-western Argentinean Patagonia where it has been recorded from a system of endorreic and isolated lagoons scattered&#160;on the basaltic plateau in and around Laguna Blanca National Park, in mid-western Neuqu√©n Province. Currently, the species is known to inhabit 23 lagoons (Cuello et al. 2009b). Its elevational range is 1,245-1,434 m asl.

A monitoring protocol was developed by H. Pastore and M.E. Cuello in 2011 to guide the survey of natural disturbances in the terrestrial and aquatic habitat of the frog, as well as, disturbances caused by livestock and/or the introduction of exotic fishes. The protocol is applied twice each year (Administraci√≥n de Parques Nacionales 2011). The National Park Administration lists this species as of ‚ÄúSpecial Value‚Äù.Conservation NeededMeasures need to be put in place to prevent the introduction of predatory fishes into the habitat of the remaining subpopulations outside the national park, including in the wetlands areas on private land. Ponds with highly complex vegetation and rocky microhabitats currently without protection because they lie outside Laguna Blanca National Park (in Neuqu√©n Province) should be a high priority for inclusion in a regional system of protected areas (Cuello et al. 2017b).Research NeededThere is a need for studies on some aspects of life history and ecology, such as its reproductive biology.

In southern Brazil the adults migrate to coastal waters with depths of less than 20 m from November to March. At that time artisanal fisheries operate from the beaches, and the guitarfish catches are 98% pregnant females. Adult males reach the beach fishing grounds at the end of February. Parturition and mating take place in March. Soon after, the males and females return to deeper waters and disperse to depths of 40 to 150 m over the continental shelf. Newborn pups and juveniles remain in shallow waters throughout the year. The smallest pregnant females found were 91 cm TL. The proportion of pregnant females increases with size, and 100% pregnancy occurs in females of &gt;119 cm TL. Litter size is 4 to 12 pups, the number increasing with the size of the mother. Pregnancy is divided into two stages: a) Period of dormancy (embryonic diapause). This occurs from April to November, while the pregnant females are in deeper water (40 to 150 m), at temperatures of 13 to 18¬∞C. Ovulation occurs in April when the fertilized eggs are enclosed within a common shell (candle). However, they remain dormant in the uterus with no embryonic development. b) Period of embryonic development. This requires higher summer temperatures in shallow waters and does not start until females return to shallow waters in November. From November to March, bottom temperature at depths of 10 to 20 m near the coast are 20 to 25¬∞C. Embryonic development starts when the common shell (or candle) breaks up in December and ends with birth in February. Embryos are found only from December to late February. Their size increases from 1 cm TL in December to 29 cm TL in February, when birth takes place. A von Bertalanffy growth curve was established on the basis of annuli counts in vertebrae of 289 individuals from 36 to 123.1 cm TL. Annulus formation occurred in September, and growth parameters obtained for observed length-at-age were: L8=135.51 cm TL; K=0.1940 and To=-1.0785. Full maturity is reached at nine years for females and six years for males. The fact that the females grow to a larger size and reach greater ages (longevity 28 years) than the males (longevity 15 years) reflect differences in mortality rates between the sexes. From the analysis of catch curves (Ricker 1975) carried out on a large sample collected in 1983 in southern Brazil, it was observed that females recruited to the fishery from the age of four years, with complete recruitment at the age of nine years. A total mortality coefficient of Z=0.72 was calculated for females. In contrast, males entered the fisheries at the age of four years, and recruitment was complete at the age of six years. A mortality coefficient Z=0.98 was determined for males.","Pseudobatos horkelii was formerly abundant in southern Brazil, where in the 1980s it was the only economically important species of batoid caught in the area. In southern Brazil the main fishery ports are Rio Grande and Itaja√≠.&#160;Pseudobatos horkelii is fished by otter trawl, pair trawl, shrimp trawl, beach seine and gillnet (Klippel et al. 2005). Statistics on the annual catch and effort of the Rio Grande fleet of otter trawl and pair trawl provide a record from 1975 onwards. Total landings at Rio Grande by fishery methods combined increased from 842 t in 1975 to 1,804 t in 1984 and then declined continuously to 157 t in 2001. The average trawl catch per unit effort (CPUE) of P. horkelii in southern Brazil over the years 1993 to 1999 was 17% of that observed during 1975 to 1986, indicating a decline in abundance of &gt;80% since 1986 in southern Brazil (Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren et al. 2005).  Catches increased slightly after 2000 to 0.3 tons/trip in 2002, when trawl fleets from Itaja√≠ and Rio Grande exploited a refuge area for a part of the Rio Grande do Sul population (Martins and Schwingel 2003, Vooren et al. 2005). Following this, CPUE fell again by 31% from 2002 to 2003 and the overall population is still considered to be at critically low levels (Vooren et al. 2005). Monitoring of beach-seine catches and reports from fishers in 2004 confirmed that P. horkelii is now scarce in coastal waters, and in a trawl survey in February 2004 of 62 trawl stations at depths of 7 to 20 m along 700 km of southern Brazil coastline, only 23 individuals were caught, 17 of which were juveniles (Vooren et al. 2005). Across the rest of the species range, where it is scarce, inshore fishing pressure is generally high. For example, a coastal multi-species demersal trawl fishery operates off Quequ√©n, Argentina (38¬∞37'S, 58¬∞50'S), in which bycatch of batoids fluctuates seasonally between 44.5% and 67.5% of total catch (Tamini et. al. 2006).",,Decreasing,"Pseudobatos horkelii was named the Brazilian guitarfish by Bigelow and Schroeder (1953) for its wide distribution along the Brazilian Coast and further south to Mar del Plata (Argentina). These authors recorded the southern guitarfish&#160;Pseudobatos percellens as having the same distribution, but Refi (1973) concludes that P. percellens does not occur on the Argentinean coast, and that these Argentinean records of P. percellens refer to P. horkelii (Devincenzi 1920, Lahille 1921, Devincenzi and Barattini 1926, Lopez 1946 in Refi 1973). Specimens examined by all those authors are deposited at the Museo de La Plata, Argentina. Fishery statistics of P. horkelii show important commercial catches of the species only in southern Brazil between latitudes 28 to 34¬∞S. This is evidence that the species has its centre of distribution in southern Brazil and is scarce elsewhere (Vooren et al. 2005).",,Marine,"Pseudobatos horkelii has been listed as Critically Endangered on the Brazilian federal law of Threatened and Overexploited Aquatic Species since 2004 (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Permits for directed fishing of the species are no longer issued, transport and sale of the species are prohibited, and incidental catches of the species must be discarded at sea. This law is gradually becoming more effectively enforced. Also the prohibition of trawl fishing within three nautical miles from the coast of southern Brazil is now being enforced satisfactorily. However, the species is still caught as bycatch in the legally permitted coastal gillnet fisheries and offshore trawl and gillnet fisheries. For the conservation and recovery of the stocks of P. horkelii and several other critically threatened elasmobranchs, Vooren et al. (2005) recommend fishery exclusion areas (no-take areas) on the continental shelf of southern Brazil (latitudes 28¬∞30'S to 34¬∞30'S) as follows: one continuous area along the entire coastline, within 5 to 10 nautical miles from the coast, for the protection of the coastal nursery; three large shelf areas, one starting from the coastline, two from mid-shelf, and all three extending to the shelf edge. The latter three protected shelf areas are critical wintering areas of P. horkelii. The four proposed no-take areas constitute 46% of the total shelf area. The Law of Threatened and Overexploited Aquatic Species determines that actions for the recovery of these species must be taken. In this context, steps will be taken towards implementing the proposed no-take areas on the shelf of southern Brazil.",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

At ca 60 years generation length, these declines would have occurred over the past three generations.&#160;The species, and particularly its recruitment and recovery, remain restrained by introduced predators (pigs and ants) and competitors (feral cattle), invasive plant species, and illegal slaughter and poaching of adults and juveniles.&#160;This collapse from historical levels in conjunction with ongoing threats qualifies C.&#160;guntheri&#160;for Critically Endangered under criteria A2bde. The various populations of the&#160;C. vicina&#160;species complex were previously assessed as subspecies in 1996, with&#160;C. nigra guentheri&#160;(with an unwarranted emended spelling) listed as&#160;Endangered C2a,&#160;but the previous assessment did not reflect the historical population declines that this recent assessment incorporates.This assessment incorporates contributions from&#160;the workshop on&#160;Gal√°pagos giant tortoises&#160;convened by the&#160;Gal√°pagos&#160;National Park Directorate&#160;in July 2012.","While detailed life history data are not available for the wild populations of&#160;Chelonoidis guntheri, observations on long-term captive animals indicate that the species matures at about 20-25 years of age and longevity of 100 years or more is not unusual; generation time is estimated at ca 60 years. The species is characterized by two distinct morphotypes: animals with domed shells, and some with flattened shells, known as 'aplastados'. The domed shell tortoises primarily graze on low-growing herbaceous vegetation, while the aplastado types often feed on shrubs.","Tortoises on Isabela, especially the southern populations, notably Chelonoidis guntheri on Sierra Negra Volcano, were subject to extensive over-exploitation for food by sailors and settlers in the 18th and 19th centuries, from which they still have not recovered (Pritchard 1996). Following this, large numbers of tortoises, especially C. guntheri, were rendered onsite for their oil. Further impacts were suffered from the introduction of a wide range of predators and ecological competitors, as well as introduced invasive vegetation changing nutrient and shelter dynamics for the tortoises. Significant introduced species include goats, pigs, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, ants (Solenopsis), blackberry, and guava. Goats have been eliminated from Isabela in recent years and some of the other invasives are subject to ongoing management programs, but the risk of (re)introductions of problem species remains. Ants are currently the greatest problem in tortoise nesting zones. Poaching remains a significant problem and, along with ant predation on nests, can be considered a limiting factor. Poaching also has a direct impact on conservation actions, as the repatriation of tortoises must be to inaccessible areas where poaching is improbable to ensure survival of the young. Additional information is needed on the impacts of ongoing human activities (farming, poaching) on C. guntheri population dynamics. Volcanic eruptions represent a long-term risk factor, not only from direct mortality but also by lava flows cutting off migration routes between feeding and nesting areas.

618,South America,Squatina argentina,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,SQUATINIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,SQUATINIDAE,Squatina,argentina,A2bd,"The Argentine Angelshark (Squatina argentina) is a small (to 138 cm total length) demersal shark species that occurs in waters in the Southwest Atlantic from Santa Catarina, Brazil, south to Buenos Aires, Argentina. This species inhabits sandy substrates at depths of 51-320 m. The species has a relatively slow life history, giving birth to 7-11 pups with a biennial or possibly triennial reproductive cycle. The Argentine Angelshark is targeted and/or caught as bycatch in demersal trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries, and is sold and utilized for human consumption (although angel sharks are protected in Brazil). Angel sharks are notoriously difficult to identify, and catches are typically reported at the generic level and therefore include at least three species that are native to the region (the Argentine Angelshark, the Hidden Angelshark (S. occulta), and the Angular Angelshark (S. guggenheim)). Declines in CPUE during research trawls in southern Brazil indicate that the population declined substantially in the mid-late 1990s. Further research data corroborates this, indicating the equivalent of a reduction of more than 90% over three generation lengths (46.5 years). There is also heavy fishing pressure in Uruguay and Argentina, where the Argentine Angelshark is caught alongside the Hidden Angelshark and the Angular Angelshark. Landings data indicate a reduction of angel sharks in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone of over 70% over three generations, and datasets further south in Argentina indicate a reduction of over 90% over a similar timeframe (although these landings likely consist mostly of Angular Angelshark). Due to heavy fishing pressure across its range, reported declines in landings and research surveys, and the species' low productivity, it is inferred that this species has undergone, on balance, a population reduction of at least 80% over the past three generations (46.5 years). Therefore, the Argentine Angelshark is listed as Critically Endangered A2bd. Strict regulations for limits to fisheries catch are needed, as is the identification and protection of critical habitat.","The Argentine Angelshark is a demersal shark that inhabits shelf and upper slope waters between 51 and 320 m depth (Ebert et al. 2013). The species is an ambush predator and prefers soft substrates, especially sand. Like other angel sharks, the Argentine Angelshark is lecithotrophic viviparous with two functional ovaries (Vooren and Klippel 2005). This species gives birth to 7-11 pups (Vooren and da Silva 1991), with most females carrying 9 or 10 young (Vooren and Klippel 2005). The reproductive cycle is two to three years. This species reaches a maximum size of 138 cm total length (TL) and matures at approximately 120 cm TL for both sexes (da Silva 1996). Argentine Angelsharks are estimated to have a generation length of approximately 15.5 years, based on the similarly-sized and closely-related Hidden Angelshark (Vooren and Klippel 2005).","The Argentine Angelshark is threatened by being caught as bycatch in demersal trawl and gillnet fisheries, and it was also previously targeted. In southern Brazil, directed fisheries using bottom-gillnets on the outer shelf and upper slope developed rapidly between the 1990s and early 2000s and depleted this species (Vooren and Klippel 2005). At the beginning of the 2000s, another fishery developed in the area for the anglerfish&#160;Lophius gastrophysis with bottom gillnets at depths of 130 to 600 m, and this species was caught as bycatch (Perez and Wahrlich 2005, Mafra Pio et al. 2016). Since 2004, both of these fisheries have been closed, but angel sharks are still captured illegally by trawl and gillnet fisheries and landed without skins in clandestine ports (Montealegre-Quijano unpubl. data 2017).The nocturnal habits of angel sharks render them susceptible to bottom gillnets which are set at night, and increases in captures during the 1990s are attributed to the introduction of this gear on the shelf and slope off southern Brazil at that time. Gillnets were reported as six times more effective at catching angel sharks than trawling alone (Vooren and Klippel 2005).Part of this species' southern distribution in the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone overlaps with the Patagonian scallop (Zygochlamis patagonica) bottom trawl fishery, which is likely to catch this species as bycatch.","Angel shark identification in the Southwest Atlantic is difficult, and therefore catches are typically reported for the genus rather than at the species level. There are three species with overlapping ranges, depths, and habitat types in the region (Angular Angelshark, Argentine Angelshark, and Hidden Angelshark), and all are likely to face similar threats and fishing pressure.Southern BrazilAngel sharks are heavily fished in southern Brazil and significant reductions have been documented there. In the mid-1980s, the Argentine Angelshark was common and abundant in scientific research trawls on the outer shelf and upper slope of Rio Grande do Sul (Vooren and Klippel 2005). During this period, commercial fishing in the area had not yet begun, and a resident population of this species with high natural abundance existed. Annual catches of angel shark (Squatina spp.) peaked at about 2,000 t in 1986-1989 and again in 1993, and then decreased to 900 t in 2003 (equivalent to a reduction of 93% over three generations). Angel shark CPUE by otter trawl and pair trawl during research cruises on the continental shelf decreased by about 85% from 1984 to 2002 (CEPERG 2003, Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren and Klippel 2005). An angel shark bottom gillnet fishery commenced around 1990 and angel sharks used to be caught in the 2000s in large amounts by this gear (Miranda and Vooren 2003). Detailed analysis of two independent sets of scientific fishing data at depths of 100-500 m constitutes evidence that between 1986 and 2002 the abundance of both Hidden and Argentine Angelsharks experienced a reduction of around 80% on the shelf and upper slope in the area between Cabo de Santa Marta Grande (28¬∞40‚ÄôS) and Arroio Chu√≠ (33¬∞50‚ÄôS), which is equivalent to a reduction of &gt;98% over three generations. Data on scientific fishing and commercial fishing together are evidence that between 1986 and 2002 there was a reduction of about 80% for angel sharks on the southern Brazilian slope (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Another dataset indicates that there was an 86% reduction in Argentine Angelshark between 1986 and 2001 (R. Barreto unpubl. data 2018).Research trawl surveys of the outer shelf in the years 1986/87 and 2001/02 confirmed that in southern Brazil the abundance of Angular Angelshark has decreased to 15% of its original level and this is attributed to recruitment overfishing primarily due to the bottom gillnet fishery (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ)The Argentine Angelshark is uncommon in Uruguay and Argentina in commercial landings but is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In Uruguay, angel sharks are caught by trawling on the platform and declared as ‚Äúangelito‚Äù. Annual catches of Angular, Argentine, and Hidden Angelsharks together in Uruguay were about 300 t in the years 1998-2001 (Paesch and Domingo 2003). The estimated capture has been 200 to 400 metric tons (MT) per year between 1997 and 2005. Between 1997 and 2010, the average declared landings of angel sharks was 277 t and decreased to less than 50 t in 2011 and 2012 to rise again to 170 t in 2013 (Domingo et al. 2015). There is no clear trend in the landings data from Uruguay from 1996 to 2018 (CTMFM 2018). There are no statistics by species, but during research surveys in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ), Milessi et al. (2001) found that Angular Angelshark was the dominant species in the catch.Argentinian landings in the AUCFZ declined by 51% between 1996 and 2017, equivalent to a 78% reduction over three generation lengths (CTMFM 2018).Argentina (south of the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone)In Argentina, the three species of the genus are landed together as ‚Äúpez √°ngel‚Äù and it is probable that more than 90% of the landed angel sharks are Angular Angelshark (G. Chiaramonte unpubl. data 2018). The declared landings of all angel sharks in Argentina decreased by 45% from 2007-2016 with a total of 39509.7 MT and an average of 3950.8 MT (J.-M. Cuevas unpubl. data 2018), which is equivalent to a reduction of 95% over three generations. Again, it is stressed that these landings trends are probably not appropriate to assign to this species, as most of the landed angel sharks have been Angular Angelshark.Overall, given documented declines in landings and research trawls, the presence of heavy fishing pressure across its range, and its relatively low productivity, it is inferred that this species has undergone a population reduction of at least 80% over the past three generations (46.5 years). ",Decreasing,"The Argentine Angelshark is endemic to the Southwest Atlantic and is found from Santa Catarina State in Brazil to 39¬∞S off Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (Vaz and Carvalho 2013). There is also an unconfirmed report of the species from Rio de Janeiro (Vooren and Klippel 2005).","Although this species is officially protected in Brazil, it is still retained and sold in markets (Almer√≥n-Souza&#160;et al.&#160;2018). It is used for its meat, which is known locally as ca√ß√£o anjo, which is more valuable than other shark meat marketed simply as ca√ß√£o (Vooren and Klippel 2005, Barreto et al. 2017, Almer√≥n-Souza et al. 2018). In Uruguay, the species is targeted for its meat in gillnet and bottom trawl fisheries and is also caught as bycatch on demersal longlines (Domingo et al. 2008).&#160; In Argentina, this species is not targeted directly in fisheries, but is caught as bycatch in demersal trawl and gillnet fisheries. Angel sharks are sold locally and consumed fresh (pollo de mar) and/or salted and dried (bacalao argentino) (Chiaramonte 1998).",Marine,"In Brazil, trawling in inshore waters is prohibited and all angel sharks are protected, but enforcement of this regulation has been and still is not sufficient (Vooren and Klippel 2005, Montealegre-Quijano unpubl. data 2017). The conservation status of this species will rely heavily upon the successful implementation of these management arrangements. Full observer coverage onboard domestic vessels should provide accurate monitoring of trends in the future. Molecular markers of Squatina spp. have been determined for future identification of these species in local markets (Falc√£o et al. 2014).In September 2018, the government of the state of Rio Grande do Sul approved a law that extends the range in which fishing with trawls is prohibited. With the sanction and regulation of the law, the protected area will be increased from 3 nautical miles (5.5 km) offshore to 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore. The Argentine Angelshark is classified as Critically Endangered (A2bd+4bd) in Brazil (ICMBio 2016). The Angular and Hidden Angelsharks are also both classified as Critically Endangered there, and all three of these species are fully protected in Brazil as of 2014 by the normative instructions numbers 5 and 445.&#160; The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for chondrichthyans in the Argentina and Uruguay Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ) is regulated by the Binational Technical Comision (Comisi√≥n T√©cnica Mixta del Frente Mar√≠timo). Only 3 groups are regulated by a TAC limit each year: the smoothhound Mustelus schmitti, the angel sharks Squatina spp. and skates (Rajiformes). The TAC for angel sharks was constant between 2012 and 2016 (2,600 tonnes) and only in 2012 was this exceeded, with a total catch of 2709.2 t for Argentina and 27 t for Uruguay. There is only one specifically managed fishing area for chondrichthyans in the Argentine Sea and is located inside the Argentina and Uruguay Common Fishing Zone between 36¬∞ and 37¬∞S. This coastal area of about 4,562 km¬≤ is closed from October to March and protects diverse species and reproductive stages of demersal and benthic chondrichthyans (Colonello et al. 2014), including angel sharks. The total amount of days changes between years and it is applied to all type of vessels using bottom net trawling.Nursery areas of the species have not been found in southern Brazil and may exist further south off Uruguay and/or Argentina. A new abundance estimate in southern Brazil is urgently needed after almost a decade of no take protection in the country. At the same time an assessment of the relative composition of each species in commercial landings in each country is needed.The species was assessed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to determine whether its status warranted listing under the US Endangered Species Act (Casselberry and Carlson 2015).

It has a gregarious behaviour. Larvae feed on ostracods, chironomid larvae and acari. Juveniles and adults with a grinding feeding apparatus, feed on perophitic algae (Escalante and Menni 1999). Ortubay (1998) observed a narrow range of feeding temperatures, concluding that individuals cannot feed at waters of less than 17¬∫C. Maturity is reached at 37 mm TL in males and 38 mm TL in females. The breeding season occurs during late winter and early spring (August-October). Females present up to 200 oocytes (1.4 mm) rich in yolk (Ortubay and Cussac 2000). "," The greatest known threats come from the presence of introduced salmonids (i.e., Oncorhynchus mykiss) that directly predate on Naked Characin (Ortubay and Cussac 2000, Quiroga et al. 2017) and an introduced characid (i.e., Cheirodon interruptus) that is assumed as a strong competitor for food and space (P√©rez et al. 2015), showing similar diet patterns (Escalante and Menni 1999). Other threats are the impact of cows, horses, sheep and goat livestock, that promote changes in environmental conditions given by water quality changes, change in meso-habitat structures, modification of riparian condition including bank erosion and vegetation removal and water pollution. In addition, sites where the fish was not recorded or it was recorded in low densities, were found to have exotic trees, whose roots reach the springs and stream shores, causing a change in the original habitat (Velasco et al. 2016). Other threats are related to water pumps, channelizations and dam development for water storage that could modify the geomorphic and hydrological conditions of the stream. Also, increasing temperature and decreasing snow in Patagonia as predicted by climate change for the current century (Core Writing Team et al. 2014) could promote a reduction in flow.","  Although some sites still exist at the Valcheta Stream, where it is possible to find shoals of up to 300 individuals, they are isolated from other shoals distributed along the restricted range of this species. The lack of accurate density estimations precludes an estimate of the current population size. However, a decline in the distributional range of the species can be inferred when comparing previous and current surveys, suggesting a population decline. Moreover, observations made by Quiroga and Povedano (pers. obs.) confirm a change in the proportion of individuals of Naked Characin and Cheirodon interruptus, indicating that the Naked Characin is declining while Cheirodon interruptus is thriving. Given that the species has a very low dispersal ability, and the fact that it is restricted to only certain parts of the stream, its population is considered to be severely fragmented following IUCN definitions. The species is currently restricted to seven known subpopulations (five of them are very small, occupying an area of less than 0.5 km¬≤). The flow of individuals between these subpopulations is very low or even absent, since the branches of the stream that could connect them are occupied by high densities of trout.",Decreasing,"This species is known only from the headwaters of Arroyo Valcheta in the Somuncur√° Plateau, an isolated basaltic plateau in the R√≠o Negro Province, Argentinean Patagonia. Given exhaustive and extensive surveys conducted between 1993-1997 (Ortubay 1998) and between 2013-2017 (Kacoliris et al. 2015, Quiroga, M.Sc. in prep), its distribution is considered as genuinely micro-endemic. This restricted range is in agreement with habitat preferences of this species. Since the headwaters of the Valcheta Stream originate from thermal springs, the water of the first 10 km approximately has high temperatures ranging, through the year, between 18 and 26¬∫C. The Naked Characin is adapted to live in this type of environment, which is uncommon in Patagonian streams. Past and current observed occurrence for this species shows a decline in its range to less than a half of its historical known distribution, with an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of less than 40 km¬≤ and an area of occupancy (AOO) of less than 10 km¬≤. This decline is in coincidence with the increasing expansion in range of the exotic salmonid, the Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), towards the headwaters of the stream since its introduction at the beginning of the 20th century (Macchi and Vigliano 2014). Such behaviour could be related to a rapid local adaptation and heritability for higher temperatures in juveniles of this population of Rainbow Trout (Crichigno et al. 2015, Quiroga et al. 2017). The Naked Characin is considered to occur in one threat-defined location, based on the ubiquitous presence of introduced salmonids in the basin that predate on this endemic fish (Quiroga et al. 2017), and a recently introduced species of characid (Cheirodon interruptus) that is thriving in the stream and is assumed to be a strong competitor for food and space with the Naked Characin (Perez et al. 2015).

However, since 2013 the Wild Plateau Initiative has been working on in-situ efforts aimed at protecting this species and it has an agreement in place with the local protected area authorities (F. Kacoliris, S. Quiroga, pers. comm). A management plan for exotic fishes from the headwaters of the Valcheta Stream is currently being discussed and preliminary actions are planned to start at the end of 2017. In addition, a change in the legal framework is required to avoid new exotic species introductions and to support the removal of all exotic species.Conservation Actions NeededAdditional recommendations include adopting urgent and concrete conservation measures that encompass the regulated use of streams, removal of exotic fishes, and protection of headwaters in the plateau. It is suggested that the existing management plan for the area be implemented, as well as the continuation of the activities of the Wild Plateau Initiative, inclusive of the development and implementation of a Species Action Plan.Research NeededMore information is needed on this species' response to specific threats and a Population Viability Analysis (PVA) would be helpful for management purposes.",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

The 2004 assessment reported that chytridiomycosis was probably the major threat, leading to a catastrophic population decline. While there is currently no direct information confirming that chytrid has caused declines in this species, the lack of records in the 1990s is consistent with the pattern of decline in many other montane Atelopus species, and it is therefore reasonable to infer that the disease might be the cause of declines in this species (Colombia Red List Assessment Workshop August 2016).","It is not a common species, and recent surveys have not found any specimens at the type locality. A decline has also been observed at Belmira. The most recent record of the species was apparently in 2001 (Museo Historia Natural Universidad de Antioquia). There have been recent survey efforts both at the type locality (2007 and 2009‚Äì2014) and Belmira (2012), but the species was not recorded (Colombia Red List Assessment Workshop pers. comm. July 2016).",Decreasing,"This species is known from its type locality of Serrania Las Baldias, and from one other locality of Belmira in Paramo Morron, both of which are in Antioquia Department, Colombia, between 2,800‚Äì3,100 m asl. There is now also a photographic record of the species in a third locality (El Retiro) from 2010, but it needs confirmation and has been coded as ""Presence Uncertain"" in the distribution map (and is therefore not included in the calculation of EOO). It is unlikely that the species occur in between the known localities, as there is extensive livestock raising. Its EOO is 550 km2.",There are no records of this species being utilized.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),Conservation ActionsThis species has not been recorded in any protected

632,South America,Paraclaravis geoffroyi,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,COLUMBIFORMES,AVES,COLUMBIDAE,Paraclaravis,geoffroyi,C2a(i),"The combination of specialised ecological requirements, and the loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat severely threaten this species. The paucity of records in the last decade suggests that this species now has an extremely small population that is highly fragmented and declining owing to continuing habitat loss. It is therefore listed as Critically Endangered. ","It inhabits humid Atlantic forest, apparently with a preference for edge habitats in rather hilly, broken terrain. Records range from near sea-level to 2,300 m. All known records of the species in Argentina coincide with flowering events of only two species of bamboos: takuarusu Guadua chacoensis and yatevo G.trinii (Areta et al. 2009). Since it depends on bamboo seeds, and most species of bamboos produce seeds synchronously over large areas and only after many years of vegetative growth, the species must travel widely between patches of seeding bamboo (Bodrati 2009). Its Andean relative Maroon-chested Ground-dove C. mondetoura is rarely found away from patches of flowering or seeding bamboo where it gathers to forage and breed, sometimes semi-colonially (Tobias et al. 2006). Assuming their ecological requirements are similar C. goeffroyi&#160;probably undertakes irregular nomadic movements following bamboo flowerings, but it has been recorded eating other seeds (including those of sedges and grasses) and fruit. Breeding apparently occurs in the austral summer, with birds calling from November to February (Naka et al. 2000). Historically it was reported in flocks of up to 100, but no recent records have involved more than five individuals (Baptista et al. 2015).&#160;","The clearance and fragmentation of Atlantic forest for colonisation and the expansion of plantation agriculture (Dinerstein et al. 1995) have increased the physical and temporal distances between bamboo flowerings. Given its apparently highly specialised requirements, it is not inconceivable that this fragmentation is already too extensive to ensure the long-term survival of the species. It is uncommon in trade, but the taking of additional birds from the wild must have a considerable impact on such a small population. ","The species has been recorded across a large area, but the paucity of recent sightings suggests that the population size may now be very small. The population is therefore placed in the band 50-249 mature individuals. Dedicated surveys and quantified population estimates would be desirable to confirm this.",Decreasing,"Claravis geoffroyi was fairly common at the beginning of the 20th century, judging by the wide scatter of specimen records and reports of flocks of up to 100 birds. At that time it occurred from Bahia (Brazil), south through eastern Brazil to northern Argentina and eastern Paraguay, from sea-level to 2,300 m. In the last thirty years there have been a small number of reports of up to five individuals, including one from eastern Paraguay in 1994 (Lowen et al. 1996) and a few from Brazilian sites such as Itatiaia (Rio de Janeiro; 2004, possible in 2006); Ubatuba (S√£o Paulo; 1997 and 2004), Intervales (S√£o Paulo; 2003 and 2007) and Urubici (Santa Catarina; 1997), as well as&#160;from coastal Paran√° and Espirito Santo (Naka&#160;et al. 2000, Carrano&#160;et al.&#160;2004, Simon 2004, Mazar Barnett&#160;et al. 2005, G.

These reports are almost certainly reliable, but none are documented.&#160;The paucity of recent records suggests that extremely severe declines have occurred and it has been suggested that the species may now be extinct (Lees &amp; Pimm 2015), however there is an unconfirmed record from San Ignacio, Misiones Province, Argentina in 2017 (eBird 2018). The species was recently designated Possibly Extinct in Brazil (MMA 2014).&#160;Its range is now highly fragmented; this coupled with its specialised habitat requirements appear to render the species highly vulnerable to extinction.",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions Underway It is considered Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) in Brazil (MMA 2014). It is protected by Brazilian law, and has been recorded in a number of protected areas in Brazil, including the Floresta Estadual do Palmito (Paran√°), the Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve (Espirito Santo), and several sites in the Serra do Mar. It is also reported from Iguaz√∫ National Park, Argentina. However, numbers observed are small and no population is known to be adequately protected. The small captive population held by a few Brazilian aviculturists has apparently died out.Conservation Actions ProposedUrgently survey to locate additional populations, using tape-playback if possible, and focusing search on bamboo flowering events. Record and document its vocalisations. Develop a CMS agreement for this and other bamboo specialists.

This is a precautionary listing as the species seems to be declining at known localities, but further, targeted surveys are required to confirm the population trend, and there remains a degree of uncertainty around the identity, extent, and virulence of the observed disease. However, the potential effect of this disease could be devastating if it behaves similarly to known amphibian pathogens, such as chytridiomycosis, in Latin America.","This species has only been found in rocky streams on the slopes of Itoup√© massif (Fouquet et al. 2018).&#160;Males call from the banks of these streams during the day and, like other species in the genus, endotrophic tadpoles are carried on the back of the males until metamorphosis (Fouquet et al. 2018).","While there is no direct confirmation, the prevalence of the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd),&#160;in Dendrobatoidea is particularly high in French Guiana (Courtois et al. 2015) and the decline observed in this species is similar to other species in the genus with similar ecology (namely Anomaloglossus tepequem - Fouquet et al. 2018), as well as following the pattern of Bd-related declines seen in other stream-dwelling species across South America. There is no significant habitat disturbance or degradation within this species' range that is likely to have caused the observed population declines and, combined with the observations of morphological abnormalities, chytridiomycosis (caused by Bd) or another pathogen is likely to be the cause.","Many individuals of this species were observed on the first expedition to Itoup√© massif in 2010, however&#160;only four individuals were detected in 2016 despite eight days of searching by four herpetologists (Fouquet et al. 2018).

It consequently qualifies as Critically Endangered. ","It inhabits remnant native forests, on which it appears to be completely dependent for breeding (there is a strong negative correlation between the presence of non-native vegetation and the location of nests [Hodum in litt. 2007, 2008]), but also utilises non-native plant communities during the non-breeding season, feeding on introduced plants, such as Eucalyptus globulus and garden flowers. This usage of non-native plants is especially common in the austral autumn and winter when only one native species (Raphithamnus venustus) flowers (Roy et al. 1999). It feeds on the endemic Cabbage Tree (Dendroseris litoralis) in late summer (Hahn et al. 2015). It is mostly nectarivorous, but small insects are taken from leaves or in flight. The proportion of insects in the diet increases during the chick-rearing period. The sex ratio is heavily skewed, with three males to every female (Roy et al. 1999). It may experience competition with S. sephaniodes, especially over access to Dendroseris litoralis flowers post-breeding (L√≥pez-Calleja et al. 2006). ","The clearance and degradation of vegetation by humans since the late 16th century and the impacts of herbivorous mammals (especially rabbits introduced in the 1930s) has limited the availability, quantity and quality of food resources. Wood harvesting at lower altitudes has contributed to the loss of native habitat (Roy et al. 2013). Habitat quality is also being degraded by the spread and dominance of invasive plants, most prominently by Elm-leaf Blackberry Rubus ulmifolius, Maqui Aristotelia chilensis and Murtilla Ugni molinae (Anon. 2005). Introduced predators, such as rats, cats and coatis, have been implicated in the mortality of some birds and may be responsible in part for its decline (Roy et al. 1999, Hahn and R√∂mer 2002). Cats have been documented killing firecrowns in town during the non-breeding season (Hodum in litt. 2007, 2008). Austral Thrush Turdus falcklandii has been observed predating firecrown nests and may represent a threat (Hahn et al. 2011a). As is true with many island species, firecrowns are easily approached, thus rendering them highly susceptible to predation. Additionally, during its nocturnal torpor, this species is presumed to be very vulnerable to predation (Hahn and R√∂mer 2002). Males are able to defend territories with highly productive resources, but the smaller females are possibly being indirectly outcompeted by S. sephaniodes (Roy et al. 1999, Wolf 2008). Observations of interactions between the two species in 2006-2007 found no evidence that male fernandensis were negatively affected by S. sephaniodes, but that female fernandensis may suffer from interference competition and may be marginalised from high quality foraging habitat (Wolf and Hagen 2012). S. sephaniodes prefers sites with denser vegetation, higher species diversity and located less high off the ground, and therefore may not constrain nesting habitat use by S. fernandensis; alternatively competitive displacement for nest site choices may already have occurred (Hahn et al. 2011a). A study in 2016 found a negative association between the abundance of the two species in the post-breeding season, with individuals of both species tending to congregate in area where the other was less abundant (Vizentin-Bugoni et al.&#160;2017).Preliminary analyses of the population revealed some genetic variation, but significantly less than in S. sephaniodes (Roy et al. 1999). A devastating tsunami in February 2010, which destroyed the only town on Robinson Crusoe had a significant impact on the species, reducing the population to 740 individuals in March 2011 (I. Hahn in litt. 2015). Seasonally important populations of the endemic Cabbage Tree (Dendroseris litoralis)&#160;in the coastal zone were lost as a result of the tsunami which resulted in a reduction in the local abundance of Juan Fernandez Firecrown (Hahn et al. 2015). The disaster likely also reduced cat predation. ","A survey in 2011 using line transect and banding counts estimated the population at 740 individuals, equating to 490 mature individuals, this figure is considerably lower than previous estimates as a result of the tsunami in 2010 (Hahn et al. 2015) and the population is likely to have recovered slightly since (I. Hahn in litt. 2015).&#160;The population was previously estimated to number 2,500-3,000 individuals in total, roughly equating to 1,700-2,000 mature individuals (P. Hodum&#160;in litt.&#160;2007).&#160;The current population is therefore estimated at a 490-2,000 mature individuals, or 740 - 3,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"Sephanoides fernandensis is endemic to the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, Chile, where the nominate race is confined to c. 11 km2 on Isla Robinson Crusoe (Hahn et al.&#160;2005).

Historical records indicate that densities on Robinson Crusoe were formerly much greater than the 684 individuals (varying between 804 birds in the austral summer and 445 in autumn) estimated in 1988-1989. Direct count surveys in 1995-1997 indicated that the population was in the low hundreds (Roy et al. 1999), and transect counts were used in 2001-2002 to estimate a total population of 1,258 individuals (Hahn et al. 2006). However, more thorough surveys conducted in 2005 and repeated in 2006, coupled with quantitative modelling, estimated population densities in different habitats and concluded that the global population is considerably larger: c.2,500-3,000 individuals (P.

Torres-Mura in litt. 1999), and the islands have been nominated for World Heritage listing (Hulm 1995). Conservation is being led by Oikonos (Oikonos n.d.). Key activities which have already taken place are (Hodum and Tom√© 2005, Hodum in litt. 2007, 2008): the hiring of two island residents as project coordinators; control of invasive plants and herbivores (including volunteer programmes for island residents to participate in invasive plant removal), which appears to increase nesting success of the species; invasive predator control (including cat control in the town on Robinson Crusoe); habitat restoration in native forest; a community outreach programme aimed at engaging local people (Anon 2005) and including environmental education programmes for local schoolchildren; as well as population surveys and monitoring of active nests, phenology and reproductive success. The endemic plant&#160;Dendroseris litoralis has been planted in settlement areas to provide nectar resources for the species (Hahn et al. 2011b). The population has been monitored since 2006, and a workshop on terrestrial bird census techniques was organized for local people in October 2011, aimed at forming a local team that can carry out regular bird censuses; a pilot project was implemented to test the capacity of the trained team of local fieldworkers to gather data by using a monitoring protocol. Ongoing and planned work includes further invasive plant control, the planting of native plant species, carrying out environmental education workshops in the local high school and the development of a programme of cat control (Oikonos n.d., Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund 2017).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor the population using a quantitative census methodology that allows for statistical comparisons between surveys. Ensure that Cabbage Trees that were destroyed by the 2010 tsunami are replanted (Hahn et al. 2015). Enforce grazing restrictions on national park land (Roy et al. 1999).

It is therefore listed as Critically Endangered.  ","This gleaning insectivore is found primarily in Dicksonia externa fern forest, and has a strong association with canelo Drimys confertifolia, an endemic species of tree. It also regularly occurs in Lophosauria quadripinnata dominated slopes in the upper elevations of the island (P. Hodum in litt. 2012). It is most common along stream courses where luxuriant Dicksonia grows to a height of 5 m. There are records at elevations as low as 600 m, but it occurs primarily at 800-1,300 m in the austral summer (Hahn and R√∂mer 1996). The species has a minimum territory size of 4 ha per pair in optimal habitat, although most are larger due to poorer habitat quality, and it nests in natural and man-made cavities, particularly in small natural holes in steep rocks (Hahn et al. 2004, P. Hodum in litt. 2007, 2008, Hahn et al. 2010, 2011). Nesting occurs from late November to early February (Hahn et al. 2011) and fledglings have been noted in January and February (P. Hodum in litt. 2006, 2012). Only four natural nests have ever been found (Hahn et al. 2010), but three complete and four incomplete nests were constructed in nest boxes (Tomasevic et al. 2010). All known nest sites have shown a strong association with canelo (Hahn et al. 2010, Tomasevic et al. 2010). The nests found in nest boxes had a supporting structure of canelo and tree-fern Dicksonia externa rootlets and a soft cup of petrel (Pterodroma externa and P. longirostris) feathers (Tomasevic et al. 2010). Adults fed nestlings with arthropod prey, particularly lepidopteran larvae (Hahn et al. 2010). It is typically skulking and found in pairs, or family groups during the summer months (P. Hodum in litt. 2012).","It is probably secure as long as mature tracts of the ferns Dicksonia and Lophosauria remain intact, but a large proportion of natural vegetation on the island has been degraded and fragmented by goat-trampling, fire and timber-cutting (I. Hahn in litt. 2004, Hahn et al. 2004, Anon. 2007). Mature trees are important for foraging, roosting and probably provision of nesting cavities (P. Hodum in litt. 2007, 2008, 2012). Introduced mammalian predators are thought to have a significant impact on the population, with rats (Rattus spp.) and possibly mice (Mus musculus) impacting on brood survival, and feral cats impacting on juvenile and adult survival (Hahn and R√∂mer 2002, Tomasevic et al. 2010). Significantly, it is absent from the lowlands, where the forest understorey has already been destroyed. An unusual increase of native Red-backed Hawk&#160;Geranoaetus polyosoma&#160;during the last decade, as illegal hunting of this species by fishermen has ceased and the hawk population has benefited from preying upon introduced mammals (Hahn et al. 2004), may have contributed modestly to any recent declines, with several cases noted of hawks preying on rayaditos (I. Hahn in litt. 2004, Hahn et al. 2004). Having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is also potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International unpubl. data).

Fjelds√• in litt. 1999, Estades 2007). It migrates altitudinally and may require fairly continuous vegetation along rivers to undertake such movements (Howell and Webb 1995). Estades et al. (2007) observed woodstars feeding on the flowers of native trees like the cha√±ar (Geoffroea decorticans)  and pimiento (Schinus  molle), as well as ornamentals like Lantana camara, Pelargonium spp. and Bougainvillea sp. and crop plants such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa), garlic, onion (Allium spp.), and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). They noted that the favoured species have entomophyllous flowers rather than typical ornithophyllous flowers (Estades et al. 2007). The species has often been reported feeding in gardens, particularly on Lantana and Hibiscus flowers (Fjelds√• and Krabbe 1990), but it is comparatively rare in such habitats (Howell and Webb 1995). It uses fruit groves for feeding (Citrus spp.) and nesting (olive trees) (C. Estades in litt. 2007). Despite the large numbers formerly seen feeding in flowering trees, it is usually a solitary feeder. Active nests have been found in April, May, late August and September and there appear to be two annual peaks in breeding activity (Estades 2007, Estades et al. 2007). It is likely that males display at leks. Courtship territories are placed above dense thickets which are now scarce in Azapa and V√≠tor (Clark et al. 2013).","Remaining native habitat in the narrow and heavily cultivated valleys inhabited by the species is confined to small patches, and the indigenous plants favoured may be severely threatened. Dense thickets, possibly used as courtship territories, are now scarce due to the spread of agricultural activities in Azapa and V√≠tor (Clark et al. 2013). Although it has adapted to use introduced plants, the presence of certain native species may still be a limiting factor (Estades 2007). The cha√±ar tree Geoffroea decorticans may be an important food resource, but is often destroyed by farmers who consider it invasive and believe it attracts mice (Estades 2007). Pesticides began to be heavily used in the Azapa valley in the 1960s in order to control the Mediterranean Fruit-fly and other crop pests, but as the Peruvian Sheartail Thaumastura cora has not suffered similar declines, this may not be the primary cause of this species's decline (Estades 2007). Competition with Peruvian Sheartail has been suggested as a potential threat (Estades et al. 2007, C. Estades in litt. 2007, S. N. G. Howell in litt. 2007, Clark&#160;et al. 2013). A recent study which examined interactions between the two species found that food niche overlap is relatively low and that&#160;E. yarrellii&#160;dominates T. cora in male‚Äìmale territorial interactions. However, potentially increased energetic costs for E. yarrellii associated with frequent territorial chases and courtship displaying with sheartails may exacerbate the effects of other threats on E. yarrellii (van Dongen et al. 2013). Hybridisation is also a potential threat; a male hybrid of the two species was found in the Azapa valley where Peruvian Sheartail is common and Chilean Woodstar rare, and a low level of hybridisation has been found among the two species (Clark et al. 2013, van Dongen&#160;et. al.&#160;2013). The various threats of habitat destruction, pesticide use and competition with other hummingbirds are likely to be synergistic in their impacts on the species (P. L. Gonzalez-Gomez in litt. 2014).","Recent counts from 2010-2015 have produced estimates of between 405 and 592 individuals (Lazzoni Traversaro 2015, Ya√±ez 2016), which roughly equates to 270 - 395 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Eulidia yarrellii is only known to breed regularly in the Azapa, Chaca (Vitor) and Camarones valleys, Arica department, extreme northern Chile (Estades 2007, A. Jaramillo in litt. 2014). Stragglers have been found north to Tacna and possibly Moquegua departments, southern Peru, and there is a historical record as far south as northern Antofagasta province; yet, there are no recent records for Peru (Estades 2007). It was described as very common in the first half of the 20th century, with over 100 individuals seen feeding together. In the late 1980s, the species was noted as common in gardens in Arica and regular in the Lluta Valley; however, it has since disappeared from these areas, and it is now rare in the Azapa Valley, where it was once regular and common (Estades 2007, A. Jaramillo in litt. 2014). In 2003, the Azapa valley held around 75% of the total population, which was estimated at around 1,500 individuals (Estades 2007), while in 2007 the total population was estimated at around 1,200 individuals (55% in Azapa and 45% in Chaca) (C. F. Estades in litt. 2007). Recent counts from 2010-2015, however, suggests that the population has since declined to around 500 individuals (D. Lebbin in litt. 2012, Lazzoni Traversaro 2015, Ya√±ez 2016). Population estimates have shown that the Azapa and Chaca populations have reduced by 15.6% annually (81.6%) in 10 years (C. F. Estades in litt. 2013). Although the rate of decline appears to have lessened over recent years, population counts from between 2003 and 2015 (Lazzoni Traversaro 2015, Ya√±ez 2016) indicate that the population has likely undergone a reduction of approximately 80% across the past three generation lengths. Monthly searches for the species in all Tacna valleys (southern Peru) during 2008-2009 did not yield any records of this species (N. Hidalgo in litt. 2013).

A ten-year species recovery plan was approved in 2004 and included plans for a public awareness campaign, a study of competition between the woodstar and Peruvian Sheartail, a permanent population monitoring programme, restoration of natural vegetation in the Azapa and Lluta valleys, incorporation of its conservation into the agenda of the local Good Agricultural Practices committee, and a study of the feasibility of an ex-situ conservation project and reintroduction into suitable areas within the historical range (Estades 2007, Estades et al. 2007). Attempts have been made to provide artificial feeders for the species; however, it proved reluctant to use them and other hummingbird species displaced E. yarrellii through their monopolisation of the new resource (P. L. Gonzalez-Gomez in litt. 2014). There are plans to create a network of small reserves to protect the habitat used by the species for lekking and breeding; two small reserves have now been created:&#160;the Chaca Biologic Station in the Valley of Vitor and El Rapido Biologic Station in the Azapa Valley&#160;(Lebbin 2013, Ya√±ez 2016, Almendras undated). Trial habitat restoration at a site in the Chaca valley was successful, with the species using the restored habitat for breeding (Ya√±ez 2016).

Road-building and associated rural development have a negative impact and inhibit dispersal (Herzog and Kessler 1998, Fjelds√• in litt. 1999). Hunting for its meat seems to be by far the biggest threat and is likely to be having a serious negative impact in all parts of its range (Gasta√±aga 2006, R. MacLeod in litt. 2014). Human encroachment (for the growing of coca and other farming) and severe hunting pressure is increasing throughout the range, including in national parks, which lack effective protection, and effective extinction in the wild may take place within 20-30 years unless massive conservation action can be achieved (R. MacLeod in litt. 2014). The Bolivian government recently announced a plan to build a highway through half of the (TIPNIS) (Programa Paujil Copete de Piedra, n.d.). Climate change may also pose a threat to the species; modelling of the change in the species's range in response to climate change alone projected a 55-85% reduction between 2014 and 2080 (del Rosario Avalos &amp; Hern√°ndez 2015).","This species is poorly known; the total population is estimated to number 1,000-4,999 mature individuals, roughly equivalent to 1,500-7,500 individuals in total.",Decreasing,"Pauxi unicornis is known to occur only in central Bolivia. It is known from the adjacent Ambor√≥ and Carrasco National Parks (Cox et al. 1997, Herzog and Kessler 1998, Mee 1999, R. MacLeod in litt. 2000. Maillard 2006) and has more recently been found in Isiboro-Secure Indigenous Territory and National Park (TIPNIS) and along the outer edge of the Cordillera Mosetenes, Cochabamba, Bolivia (R. MacLeod in litt. 2007). It was formerly found along the length of Carrasco's northern boundary (R. MacLeod in litt. 2000), but recent surveys found it in very few locations here (R. MacLeod in litt. 2007). Extensive searches over several years have failed to locate the species in Madidi National Park, La Paz, Bolivia (R. MacLeod in litt. 2003, Hennessey 2004a, A. MacCormick in litt. 2004), in the rio Tambopata area near the Peru/Bolivia border (R.

Its diet consists of fruit, seeds, soft plants, larvae and insects. Display songs seem to peak in February and March (R. MacLeod in litt. 2007, Gasta√±aga et al. 2011). In common with other cracids the species is likely to have a low reproductive rate (Banks 1998, Cox et al 1997, Renjifo 1997). Breeding males may engage in an 'exploded lek' display system during the peak of breeding season calling, possibly gathering in ridge top forest away from the noise interference of watercourses in the valleys below (Gasta√±aga et al. 2011). However this system has not been adequately shown for congeneric taxa, and the species may simply be patchily distributed within the ecologically diverse landscape they inhabit (del Hoyo &amp; Motis 2004). ","Continuing hunting by local communities is the single greatest threat to the species and is likely to be having a serious negative impact (Gasta√±aga 2006, Gasta√±aga et al. 2011). It was rediscovered due to reports from hunters, and there are reliable reports of a hunter trying to sell the species to local restaurants as bush meat in 2008 (R. MacLeod and M. Gasta√±aga in litt. 2014). Although the species is legally protected there is no concerted effort to educate the local population as to the global importance of the species and no formal infrastructure in place to establish protection (Gasta√±aga et al. 2011). Road-building and associated rural development have a negative impact and inhibit dispersal (Herzog and Kessler 1998, Fjelds√• in litt. 1999). Subsistence agriculture threatens its habitat (R. MacLeod in litt. 2000), as does opening up the foothills to colonisation and hunting. New gold mining developments and conversion of patches of forest to pasture have been recently recorded in and around the&#160;El Sira Communal Reserve (Novoa&#160;et al.&#160;2016). Oil exploration and illegal logging are potential future threats in El Sira, as well as forest clearance by colonists.","A potential population of up to 400 individuals was estimated based on the assumption that the species might eventually be found throughout the Cerros del Sira at appropriate altitudes (Gasta√±aga in litt. 2007, Gasta√±aga et al. 2011). Local knowledge surveys and field visits since then suggests this is unlikely, so a population estimate well below 250 mature individuals seems appropriate (R. MacLeod and M. Gasta√±aga in litt. 2014).",Decreasing,"Pauxi koepckeae is restricted to&#160;the Cerros del Sira in Hu√°nuco, central Peru. Previously considered a subspecies of P. unicornis, this taxon had gone unrecorded since its description in 1969 but its continued presence was established by local knowledge surveys in 2003 and observations in 2005 (Gasta√±aga 2006). Surveys in 2006 and 2008 found the species at four locations, all located within 30 km of each other in the Cerros del Sira (Gasta√±aga et al. 2011). A density of 8.3 singing males per square kilometer was calculated, suspected to reflect an exploded lek of the species rather than the typical density throughout the suitable habitat given the very low encounter rates in all other surveys (Gasta√±aga et al. 2011). An estimate of less than one individual per square kilometer was considered to be the likely density within the identified range (Gasta√±aga et al. 2011). This is consistent with previous field surveys' very low encounter rate and local reports suggest that it is very rare here (Mee et al. 2002, A. MacCormick in litt. 2004, R. MacLeod in litt. 2004). An expedition to the Cerros del Sira in 2010 recorded up to four individuals (Socolar et al.&#160;2012), and a further expedition in 2015 made 19 independent detections of the species with camera traps, resulting in an overall occupancy estimate of 25% across the study transect and 55% across the current known elevational range (Bierne&#160;et al.&#160;2017). The total population for the species is estimated to be less than 400 individuals (Gasta√±aga in litt. 2007), with evidence that its numbers are declining (Gasta√±aga and Hennessey 2005).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation and research actions underwayThe species' range is theoretically protected by the El Sira Communal Reserve, although hunting still takes place here (Gasta√±aga and Hennessey 2005, Gasta√±aga in litt. 2007, Graham 2009). Extensive surveys have been conducted in recent years but have met with little success in locating the species in many areas (Mee et al. 2002, R. MacLeod in litt. 2003, Hennessey 2004, A. Maccormack in litt. 2004, R. MacLeod in litt. 2004). An education project to combat hunting and raise awareness was carried out in the Sira mountains in 2005 (Gasta√±aga 2005). Conservation and research actions proposedConduct field studies of the species's distribution, population density and ecology in order to estimate the size of the surviving population, determine its conservation requirements and vulnerability to human encroachment. Continue working with communities around Cerros del Sira in conducting local knowledge surveys about the distribution of the species and in raising awareness of its unique status. Identify and implement measures that will measurably improve the livelihoods of the local indigenous communities in return for their essential assistance in conserving the species through a community enforced hunting ban.

","It is apparently restricted to foothill forest, but tolerates secondary habitats, and the 1996 birds were in secondary growth (Lambert 2007). However, secondary growth supports far fewer epiphytic plants and bromeliads (which retain quantities of suspended water that significantly alter the microclimate within a forest); hence large areas of secondary forest may be unsuitable for the species (Lambert 2007). Seasonal altitudinal movements are suspected, which might explain the lack of post-1996 records in the Serra dos √ìrg√£os. This tiny, inconspicuous species is probably easily overlooked, perching in the canopy where it actively explores clumps of bromeliads, apparently avoiding treetops. It has been recorded eating fruit, seeds and insects, though the 1996 sightings suggest that it may specialise on mistletoe (C. E. Carvalho verbally 1998). ","Deforestation appears to have brought this species to the brink of extinction - historically driven by gold and diamond mining and the creation of coffee plantations in areas where the species was initially collected (Lambert 2007). If it is an altitudinal migrant, the lack of remaining forest below 1,000 m is likely to be a particular threat. Development within forest around the edges of the Serra dos √ìrg√£os National Park, particularly at the site of the 1996 rediscovery, is concerning (C. E. Carvalho verbally 1998). The harvesting of bromeliads, mistletoes and orchids from the forest of the region may further threaten the species by reducing food supply, but also by altering habitat structure and microclimate (Lambert 2007). Climate change could also have an impact on the species, particularly through habitat shifting (≈ûekercioƒülu et al. 2012).","The single known remaining population, rediscovered in 1996 after more than 100 years, is assumed to be tiny (fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals).",Decreasing,"Calyptura cristata has apparently declined to near-extinction within a very restricted range to the north of Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil. From the evidence of skins and one sight record, it was not uncommon, even in secondary habitat, in the mid-19th century. However, although there have been several rumours and unverified reports, the species was unrecorded during the 20th century until two birds were observed in the Serra dos √ìrg√£os on several days in October 1996 (Pacheco and Fonseca 2001). There have been no reliable records of the species since 1996 despite searches in the Reserva Ecologica Guapia√ßu, the Teresopolis area, the foothills of the Serra do Mar, Ubatuba and between Nova Friburgo and Soumidoura in September to November 2006, which investigated several unconfirmed reports (F. Olmos in litt. 2003;&#160; Lambert 2007, Lambert and Kirwan 2010). A specimen of this species, purported to have been collected somewhere in the state of S√£o Paulo between May 1819 and April 1820, was discovered in the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin, in 2007 and could potentially extend the area over which the species is known to have at least formerly occurred (Stopiglia et al. 2009); however, its true provenance has not been satisfactorily established (R√™go et al. 2013).

It is projected that it could undergo an extremely rapid population reduction given increased access and hunting, and therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered.  ","It inhabits humid forest up to 1,200 m, but there is at least one record from tropical dry forest (Strewe et al. 2010). It has been recorded in secondary growth forest and forest where timber extraction has occurred (see Ochoa et al. 2016). A GIS study of the species's distribution and habitat in the north of Cordillera&#160;Central in&#160;Antioquia found that the species required forest patches of at least 3km2&#160;(Melo&#160;et al.&#160;2008). It breeds in the dry season, nesting in December-March, with parties of adults and chicks observed in March-August (Cuervo and Salaman 1999, A. Cuervo in litt. 1999, P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999, 2000). Two breeding seasons have been recorded in the El Pauj√≠l Bird Reserve, one from December to March and another from July to September (Urue√±a 2008b). It feeds on fruit, shoots, invertebrates, and perhaps even carrion (Cuervo and Salaman 1999, Quevedo et al. 2005, A. Cuervo in litt. 1999, P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999, 2000). One recent survey recorded the consumption of seeds from a total of 15 different plant species. A terrestrial crab was also consumed. The species forages directly on the forest floor, and has never been observed foraging in a tree (Urue√±a 2008a). Roost sites, situated in foliage in trees, are near feeding areas and are used for several days (Hirschfeld 2008). ","This species may be tolerant of low levels of habitat degradation (Strewe et al. 2010); however, its range is affected by outright habitat loss and severe degradation. Vast areas of forest have been cleared since the 17th century, and are used for livestock-farming, arable cultivation, cotton and illegal drug plantations, oil extraction and mining (Dinerstein et al. 1995, Cuervo and Salaman 1999, Stiles et al. 1999, Strewe et al. 2010, L. G. Olarte in litt. 1993, L. M. Renjifo in litt. 1993, A. Cuervo in litt. 1999, L. D√°valos in litt. 1999, P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999, 2000, J. D. Gonz√°lez in litt. 2005, J. M. Ochoa in litt. 2005). Severe deforestation has taken place in the lower part of Paramillo National Park, the middle Magdalena valley and in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Ochoa et al. 2016). A GIS study of an area representing 16.5% of the species's range in 2002 estimated that 39% of the species's potential distribution within this area was lost between 1986 and 2002, with a deforestation rate of 2.4% per year (Melo&#160;et al.&#160;2008).&#160; Deforestation outside of the El Pauj√≠l Bird Reserve was previously found to be accelerating at an annual rate of 2.1-7% (Machado and Salaman 2008/2009). There are fears that deforestation may increase in areas such as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Serran√≠a de San Lucas now that conflict has subsided (Negret et al.&#160;2017, Shanahan 2017). Cultivation (notably of coffee), logging and marijuana-plantation expansion and subsequent government spraying with non-specific herbicides affect the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Dinerstein et al. 1995, Strewe et al. 2010, L. G. Olarte in litt. 1993, L. M. Renjifo in litt. 1993). Colonisation and deforestation for coca farming are the principal threats acting around the El Pauj√≠l Bird Reserve (Quevedo et al. 2005). In 1996, there was a gold rush in the Serran√≠a de San Lucas and most of the eastern slopes have since been settled, logged and converted to agriculture and coca production (A. Cuervo in litt. 1999, L. D√°valos in litt. 1999, P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999, 2000).&#160;Few individuals are thought to remain in this area due to hunting (D. Caro in litt. 2009). Hunting and egg-collecting for food have contributed to past and present declines, and a recent survey of villages surrounding the Paramillo National Park suggests these activities will continue into the future unless the economic situation of the villagers improves (Cabarcas et al. 2008, A. Cuervo in litt. 1999, P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999, 2000). A study of hunting in three municipalities in Antioquia estimated that 57 individuals were caught by hunters between 2002 and 2003 (Melo&#160;et al.&#160;2008).&#160;The species is also threatened by infrastructure development, as exemplified by the Santa Marta-Riohacha Highway, which acts as a barrier between populations in Tayrona National Park and the foothills of the Sierra Marta de Santa Marta (Strewe et al. 2010).","The population has been estimated at around 2,200 individuals, based on a population density estimate of 1.1 individuals/km2&#160;and an estimated extent of remaining habitat of 2,000km2&#160;(Renjifo&#160;et al.&#160;2016). This roughly equates to 1,467 mature individuals, placed here in the band&#160;1,000-2,499 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species historically occurred in northern Colombia, from the base of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta west to the Sin√∫ valley and south in the Magdalena valley to northern Tolima. &#160;Relatively recent records have been obtained from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, the Serran√≠a de San Jer√≥nimo, the Serran√≠a de San Lucas, the northeast of Antioquia, the north of the Cordillera&#160;Central and the&#160;Serran√≠a de las Quinchas. The largest number of recent records have come from the region of the northeast of Antioquia, the north of the Cordillera&#160;Central and the&#160;Serran√≠a de las Quinchas&#160;(Stiles&#160;et al.&#160;1999; Carillo et al. 2015). Surveys conducted in 2003 suggest that the latter area holds the population stronghold of this species, which contributed to the establishment of El Pauj√≠l Bird Reserve (Quevedo&#160;et al.&#160;2005). The species has been recorded at two sites on the west slope of the Serran√≠a de San Lucas, Antioquia (Cuervo and Salaman 1999,&#160;A. Cuervo&#160;in litt. 1999, L. D√°valos&#160;in litt. 1999, P. G. W. Salaman&#160;in litt. 1999, 2000) and evidence was found of the existence of populations on both sides of the Serran√≠a (Salaman &amp; Donegan 2001). Records were obtained in 2009 from the northern end of the Western Cordillera on the Serran√≠a de San Jer√≥nimo, within the buffer zone of the Paramillo National Park (Mayorquin 2010). Records have also been made in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in recent years, with important populations in the Buritaca, Guachaca and Frio river basins, as well as inside Tayrona National Park and its buffer zone (Strewe&#160;et al. 2010; Pineda-Guerrero&#160;et al.&#160;2012). A density of 1.1 individuals/km2&#160;was found in the Besotes Eco-Park, on the southeastern slope of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, in 2006-2007 (Mendoza&#160;et al. 2008). The species was last recorded in the Serran√≠a de San Jacinto, Bol√≠var and at La Terretera near Alto Sin√∫&#160;in 1993 (R. S. R. Williams&#160;in litt.&#160;1999; Carrillo&#160;et al.&#160;2015).&#160;Since the 1980s, the species has undergone a rapid population reduction across its range (Cuervo and Salaman 1999, A. Cuervo&#160;in litt. 1999, L. D√°valos&#160;in litt. 1999, P. G. W. Salaman&#160;in litt. 1999, 2000, Salaman &amp; Donegan 2001; Cabarcas&#160;et al.&#160;2008; D. Caro&#160;in litt.&#160;2009; Caramillo&#160;et al.&#160;2015). An estimated 7.84% of forest within the species's range was lost between 2000 and 2010 (Renjifo&#160;et al.&#160;2016), which is equivalent to a 25% reduction across three generations, but the rate of population decline is likely to be higher than this due to hunting. Local people around the Serran√≠a de San Lucas have recorded steep declines in this population and few individuals are thought to remain at Serran√≠a de San Lucas&#160;(Salaman &amp; Donegan 2001; D. Caro&#160;in litt.&#160;2009). Interviews with people in several villages in the buffer zone of Paramillo National Park found that the majority considered the species's population to have decreased (Cabarcas&#160;et al.&#160;2008). Numbers within El Pauj√≠l Bird Reserve&#160;have increased and the density of individuals has increased from 2.1 individuals/km2&#160;to 4.7 individuals/km2&#160;in 2009&#160;(D. Caro&#160;in litt.&#160;2009) but remains far below the projected carrying capacity of 1 in 10 acres.&#160;The population in El Pauj√≠l Bird Reserve&#160;was estimated at 254 individuals in 2009, and based on the same density estimate the population in the surrounding area (including the reserve) was thought to be 509 individuals&#160;(D. Caro&#160;in litt.&#160;2009). The total population has been estimated at around 2,200 individuals, based on a population density estimate of 1.1 individuals/km2&#160;and an estimated extent of remaining habitat of 2,000km2&#160;(Renjifo&#160;et al.&#160;2016).&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on CITES Appendix III. El Pauj√≠l Bird Reserve was established in 2004, covering 848 ha in the Magdelena Valley, Serran√≠a de las Quinchas, and local authorities have introduced penalties for shooting or trapping the species (R. S. R. Williams in litt. 1999). Fundaci√≥n ProAves continue to purchase land to expand the reserve and are also engaging in habitat restoration within its boundaries (D. Caro in litt. 2009). Paramillo National Park is vast and holds this species, but no protective measures have been implemented (P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999, 2000). The large Bajo Cauca-Nech√≠ Regional Reserve probably holds the species (A. Cuervo in litt. 1999, P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999, 2000). Los Colorados Sanctuary protects part of the Serran√≠a de San Jacinto (R. S. R. Williams in litt. 1999). It occurs in Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and Tayrona National Parks (Fundaci√≥n ProAves 2009), and in the Ca√±on del R√≠o Alicante and Los Besotes reserves (Quevedo et al. 2006; Ochoa et al.&#160;2016). Of all of the reserves listed above, only El Pauj√≠l Bird Reserve is thought to receive adequate protection to safeguard this species (Quevedo et al. 2006). A new national park at Serran√≠a de San Lucas is planned for designation in 2018 (Shanahan 2017). Studies of population density and structure, as well as habitat use and behaviour of the species have been ongoing at the El Pauj√≠l Bird Reserve since 2004 (Urue√±a et al. undated)&#160;A project to evaluate the species's ecology and threats is underway in the buffer zone of the Paramillo National Park (Ochoa et al.&#160;2016).&#160;Further surveys are planned in the south-western limits of the species's range in order to delimit additional IBAs for its conservation. Since 2006, ProAves has been engaged in a variety of awareness-raising initiatives in three villages within the Serran√≠a de las Quinchas buffer zone, including training courses on bird monitoring and for park rangers and the annual Paujil Festival (Urue√±a&#160;et al. undated, Quevedo et al. 2008). Education materials have been distributed and talks have been given in schools in northeast Antioquia (Ochoa&#160;et al.&#160;2016). Fundaci√≥n ALPEC is working to create a habitat corridor to connect protected areas in the lowlands to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta through a network of private reserves (Strewe et al. 2010). Captive populations are held in several zoos and a reintroduction programme was initiated in 2011 with the intention that when captive breeding is successful individuals will be reintroduced (Fundacion ProAves 2011). The species bred in captivity in Colombia for the first time in 2014 (Shanahan 2017).Conservation Actions ProposedDetermine its population and distribution more accurately and confirm its persistence in the Serran√≠a de San Jacinto and the upper Sin√∫ drainage (Cuervo and Salaman 1999, Stiles et al. 1999, A.

The area of occupancy (AOO) has not been calculated as detailed locality records are not available, but will be very much less than 500 km2. The species mainly occurs in remnant forest patches within an agricultural landscape, and although it also occurs in low alpine vegetation, the species is considered to be severely fragmented as its primary food plant occurs in small isolated forest patches. Survival of the insect is low in coffee plantation boarder hedges and other agricultural areas, and it cannot survive in pasture land.The species is assessed as Critically Endangered (CR B1ab(ii,iii,v)) as a result of its highly restricted EOO, severe fragmentation, and continuing decline in AOO, area and quality of habitat, and in the number of mature individuals. Further resources and education efforts are required to protect the remaining habitat of this species, and survey work to confirm its restricted distribution.","The range of P.&#160;schultei&#160;is related to the distribution of Excidobates mysteriosus&#160;in a transition zone from the Mara√±on&#160;Central Dry forest (Mattoral del Mara√±on) and a higher humid montane forest above 1,400 m.&#160;The species is also present on the summits of Cerro Casapita in low alpine grassland vegetation. The primary food plant of the species is a shrub in the genus&#160;Schinus, although in captivity the insect can feed on the leaves of other plants (e.g.,&#160;Liguster spp.). Reproduction is prolific around the food plants, but individual density is low. Survival is low in coffee plantation border hedges and other agricultural areas, and they cannot survive in pasture land.","Remnant forest habitat&#160;outside reserves is impacted by conversion for agriculture (coffee plantation, cattle pasture, and more recently, banana plantation development) and fire. Local areas are subject to set bushfires by campesinos and fire impacts in two reserves that may have killed such insects which cannot escape by flying.","The population size of this species is not known, but it is suspected to be restricted and declining as a result of habitat loss. The population is inferred to be severely fragmented as a result of the occurrence of its primary wild food plant Schinus sp. in remnant shrub forest amongst coffee and banana plantations and cattle pasture.&#160;The size of the remaining habitat fragments is unlikely to sustain viable subpopulations in the longer term.",Decreasing,"Peruphasma schultei is only known from a tiny range on the southern spur of the Cordillera del C√≥ndor&#160;close to the town of Santa Rosa de la Yunga in Cajamarca Department,&#160;northeastern Peru (Conle and Hennemann 2005).

652,South America,Cinclodes aricomae,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PASSERIFORMES,AVES,FURNARIIDAE,Cinclodes,aricomae,C2a(i),"This species qualifies as Critically Endangered because its extremely small population is restricted to a severely fragmented and rapidly declining habitat, from which equivalent declines in population size are likely. Furthermore, all subpopulations are thought to be tiny. ","It was thought to be confined to tiny, humid patches of Polylepis woodland and montane scrub, mainly at 3,500-4,800 m (Parker et al. 1996), but has recently been recorded in Gynoxis woodland in Jun√≠n (D. Lane in litt. 2008). Its patchy distribution may result from a requirement for high altitude forests below glaciers (D. Lane in litt. 2013).&#160;However the 2012 discovery in the √Årea de Conservac√≠on Regional Huaytapallana, Jun√≠n was not in&#160;Polylepis&#160;or&#160;Gynoxys&#160;habitat and had limited tree cover (Aucca&#160;et al. 2015). Instead the species was observed foraging on moss-covered boulders, however it is not known whether the species breeds successfully in this habitat; and the species has been observed to move through and feed in non-forest habitat (Benham et al. 2011).&#160;It forages, presumably for invertebrates, in moss, leaf-litter and decaying wood, descending temporarily to lower elevations during periods of snow (Engblom et al. 2002). The breeding season probably begins in December but, in the Cordillera Vilcanota, pairs are territorial during the austral winter (G. Servat in litt. 1999), and have been seen carrying nesting material into a hole in a cliff face in September (H. Lloyd in litt. 2004). In Bolivia, one individual was seen carrying nesting material and an active nest was observed in November (J. Mobley in litt. 2010), and fledglings and juveniles have been observed in January and March (I. Gomez in litt. 2003, 2008, 2009;&#160; J. Mobley in litt. 2010). A study of one nesting pair suggested that the care of juveniles is biparental (I. Gomez in litt. 2003, 2008, 2009). ","The main threats are the uncontrolled use of fire and heavy grazing, which combine to cause the degradation and loss of understorey moss cover, and prevent Polylepis regeneration (Fjelds√• and Kessler 1996). Cutting for timber, firewood and charcoal is locally destructive. Afforestation with exotic species, burning vegetation to generate new pasture and trampling of vegetation and littering by visitors are all threats in Huaytapallana where the species was recently discovered (Aucca&#160;et al. 2015). As a high altitude species it may also be vulnerable to the effects of climate change.","A range-wide conservation plan for the species that was being drafted in 2010 estimates the total population at 231-281 individuals (D. Lebbin in litt. 2010), thus there are likely to be fewer than 250 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Cinclodes aricomae occurs in the Andes of south-eastern Peru (Cuzco, Apur√≠mac, Puno, Ayacucho and Jun√≠n) and adjacent La Paz, Bolivia (C. Aucca Chutas in litt. 2012). Historically, it was probably common, at least locally, and distributed along the entire Cordillera Real. Its scarce and patchy habitat now occupies c. 10% of the estimated potential cover in Bolivia, and possibly less than 3% in large parts of Cuzco (Fjelds√• and Kessler 1996), where natural habitat halved in extent during the 1980s. The majority of Peruvian records are from near Cuzco city, in Cuzco and Apur√≠mac (Fjelds√• and Kessler 1996), including the Cordillera Vilcanota (H. Lloyd in litt. 2004), with numbers estimated at 100-150 individuals in 1990 (Fjelds√• and Krabbe 1990). It was recently recorded in the Pariahuanca Valley, Jun√≠n, a significant northwesterly extension (D. Lane in litt. 2008, Witt and Lane 2009) and in 2012 it was recorded in the √Årea de Conservaci√≥n Regional Huaytapallana, Jun√≠n (Aucca et al. 2015). Surveys in three river valleys of the Cordillera Vilcanota in 2003-2005 confirmed the species's presence at only one of ten sites visited and estimated just two birds in 1.71 km2 of Polylepis habitat (Lloyd 2008). A record in 1997, in the Cordillera Apolobamba, La Paz (Valqui 2000), was the first in Bolivia since 1876, but it has since been recorded in the Ilampu Valley in 2000 (Vogel and Davis 2002) and near Sanja Pampa in 2003 (I. Gomez in litt. 2003, 2008, 2009), and subsequent surveys have found it at 14 localities in the country (J. Mobley in litt. 2010): eight in the Cordillera Apolobamba and six in the Cordillera la Paz, with the Bolivian population estimated at 50-100 individuals (D. Lebbin in litt. 2010, J.

High-resolution satellite imagery has also allowed for the identification of further areas of Polylepis habitat, which can contain this species (e.g. Benham et al.&#160;2011). An international conservation plan for the species that was being drafted in 2010 estimates the population in Peru at 181 individuals, suggesting a total population of 231-281 individuals (D. Lebbin in litt. 2010). ",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayLocal successes include the Runtacocha Highland near Cuzco, where local people are reacting positively towards better environmental control. High-altitude habitats have been surveyed and conservation measures proposed (Fjelds√• and Kessler 1996). The 1997 Bolivian record was within Madidi National Park, but Polylepis is threatened at the site (Valqui 2000). The Ilampu Valley is in the south-west corner of Cotapata National Park (Vogel and Davis 2002). Since 2004, there has been a Polylepis conservation programme working with local communities at the known sites for Royal Cinclodes. The project began with detailed mapping of Polylepis forest and key biodiversity areas within the nearly 250,000 ha of land owned by the Keara and Puina indigenous communities, and is now working to protect the forests in this area by implementing community-based conservation activities, including the establishment of communal greenhouses, plantations of native tree species for alternative firewood, and environmental education workshops in local schools and communities (I. Gomez in litt. 2003, 2008, 2009); and providing more than 400 people with new technologies, such as fuel-efficient stoves that dramatically reduce the demand for Polylepis trees as firewood (ABC 2007). This work includes efforts by the Instituto de Ecolog√≠a, with the American Bird Conservancy (ABC) providing support (B. Skolnik in litt. 2010). In Bolivia, research has been carried out to assess the feasibility of long-term Polylepis reforestation through studies into the germination and growth rate of P. pepei and the use of dendrochronology to date the frequency of destructive fires. As a result of this research, reforestation nurseries have been started ready for replanting. Work in local communities has involved sustainable income development through the support of textile trading and development of tourism infrastructure, along with improved medical provision (MacLeod 2009). As part of BirdLife's Preventing Extinctions Programme a number of actions are being implemented through Species Guardian Isabel G√≥mez (Asociaci√≥n Armon√≠a: BirdLife in Bolivia): research on the species's status and distribution has been carried out, including collating all known published and unpublished records as well as spatial modelling and on-the-ground surveys, followed by a second phase of fieldwork to study the species's reproductive biology, territory size, habitat use and movements; a socioeconomic study has been carried out for two local communities; a National Strategy for conservation of Polylepis forest has been developed; a workshop to determine human impacts on Polylepis forests and formulate the possible solutions at the regional level was held which involved the Vice-ministry of Biodiversity, Forestry Resources and Environment as well as members of local communities; and environmental education workshops have been held in three local schools to raise awareness of the birds that live in the Polylepis forest and importance of their conservation. Much of the work carried out in Bolivia between 2004 and 2009 was implemented in conjunction with the Threatened Birds of Bolivia Project, run in partnership by Asociaci√≥n Armon√≠a and the University of Glasgow (MacLeod 2009). In the Cordillera Vilcanota (Peru), ECOAN, with the support of the ABC, has established nine private reserves on community-owned land totalling over 3,600 ha (D. Lebbin in litt. 2010, C. Aucca Chutas in litt. 2012). In addition, since 2004, fencing has been put in place to protect Polylepis saplings from grazing cattle, and reforestation efforts have so far seen the planting of over 480,000 Polylepis trees and over 150,000 trees of other species since 2002, with some of the latter planted as alternative fuelwood resources. Almost 6,000 fuel-efficient ovens were supplied to 20 communities between 2002 and 2008. Further work has been carried out with local communities to improve people's health and encourage sustainable livelihoods through tourism, textile trading and improved livestock and pasture management. In 2010, a range-wide conservation plan for the species was being developed (D. Lebbin in litt. 2010). ABC and ECOAN were planning improved monitoring efforts in 2013 to collect better information on populations (D. Lebbin in litt. 2013). Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to survey remaining habitat in the relatively inaccessible Cordillera Vilcanota, to determine the species's distribution and investigate its ecology (Fjelds√• and Kessler 1996, G. Servat in litt. 1999). Implement further surveys in the&#160;√Årea de Conservac√≠on Regional Huaytapallana, Jun√≠n&#160;to assess the species's status (Aucca&#160;et al. 2015).&#160;Protect Yanacocha Forest and other Polylepis habitat in the Cordillera Vilcanota (G. Servat in litt. 1999). In the Cordillera Vilcanota, prioritise habitat restoration efforts at five localities - Mantanay, Pumahuanca, Abra M√°laga, Yanacocha and Cancha-Cancha. Habitat restoration strategies should focus on patch size maintenance/enlargement, enhancement of within-patch habitat quality, and efforts to safeguard connectivity of suitable habitat. Management of habitat quality in remnant patches should focus on maintaining necessary conditions for resource partitioning amongst insectivorous guilds, which dominate the threatened Polylepis bird community. Improve traditional land-use management by segregating agricultural, grazing and forest areas. Expand Polylepis planting programmes and plant buffer zones below Polylepis woodland to provide an alternative firewood source. Evaluate conservation problems and socioeconomic issues. Encourage local people to develop land-use management and restoration schemes (Fjelds√• and Kessler 1996). Establish private nature reserves in key sites. Encourage creation and participation of PES (Payment for Environmental Systems) schemes with local hotel owners/tour companies in Yanahuara/Urubamba.

Pritchard (1996), Fritz and Havas (2007), TTWG (2007, 2014), and TEWG (2015) have all listed the species as either Extinct or ""perhaps Extinct"".However, circumstantial evidence indicates that there may be a very few tortoises still extant on Fernandina, probably representing the same species (but possibly representing transplanted specimens from other islands). In 1964, helicopter-assisted surveys of remote interior areas on Fernandina found several large tortoise scats and a few Opuntia&#160;cactus pads with fresh tortoise bite marks (Hendrickson 1965, AKiester, unpubl. data). A brief airplane survey in 2009 of the relatively inaccessible interior upper montane mesic forest habitats on Fernandina indicated the possible sighting of a tortoise (V. Carri√≥n pers. comm.), and in 2013, during vegetation monitoring, a likely scat and some footprints were found (J. M√°laga and P. Jaramillo pers. comm.),&#160;indicating that the species may remain extant, especially since no exhaustive surveys have been undertaken of the exceedingly difficult and extensive terrain on Fernandina. Potential remaining tortoise habitat is only about 39-137 sq. km, with most of the island (642 sq. km) covered in lava flows. The possible sighting and various signs require further verification and we cannot with certainty determine that the species is Extinct, especially since individual longevity for Gal√°pagos tortoises is at least 100 yrs; therefore we assess C. phantasticus as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) under criterion D (&lt; 50 animals known) as based on the IUCN Guidelines for reaching a Possibly Extinct determination.

These factors result in its classification as Critically Endangered.  ,"This is a poorly-known inhabitant of cloud-forest at elevations of 2,610-3,600 m, but mostly 3,300-3,500 m. The species is restricted to mature montane cloud forest with a high occurrence of mistletoe (berries are a key food source of the species). Studies since 2003 have gathered extensive information on the species's breeding and feeding ecology, with the nesting period taking place from January to May. The average clutch size is three eggs. Incubation is conducted solely by the female, although post-hatching care is biparental (D√≠az 2006). ","Clearance of forest in the region of the type-locality was already extensive in 1911, and very little habitat now remains. The species remains highly threatened by forest loss for cattle pasture and selective logging of mature trees (vital for nesting) for timber and firewood. A large gold reserve was discovered close to a key population, however, the threat of deforestation was mitigated by a group of conservation organisations who purchased the area of critical habitat which is now a reserve (Anon. 2012). Most mature trees with natural cavities have been selectively logged, creating a shortage of natural nesting sites. ","The total population is estimated to number less than 250 mature individuals (Renjifo 2002, 2014) and is placed here in the band 50-249 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species has a highly restricted range on the west slope of the Central Andes of Colombia in the departments of Quind√≠o, Risaralda and Tolima. Until 2002 it was known with certainty only from the type-series collected at Laguneta and Santa Isabel in 1911. There were several possible sightings between 1980 and 2000. In 1980 a group of Hapalopsittaca presumed to be of this species were observed at Santa Rosa de Cabal, Risaralda, and an individual was later reported in the same area in 2000 (Renjifo 2002). From 1989-1991 there were reports from Alto Quind√≠o Acaime Natural Reserve and&#160;in the nearby Ca√±on del Quind√≠o Natural Reserve, Quind√≠o. In 2000 there was a reported sighting between Ibague and Cajamarca, Tolima (Renjifo 2002).&#160;In July 2002, the first confirmed sighting was made in Cajamarca, Tolima, when 14 birds were located in a small area of forest&#160;(Parr and Gilardi 2002, Anon 2010).

It is protected in Alto Quindio Acaime and Ca√±on del Quind√≠o Natural Reserves, Los Nevados National Park and El Mirador municipal reserve. It occurs in the Paramos y Bosques Alto Andinos De Genova IBA, which was designated as a regional reserve in 2008 (Tovar-Martinez 2014). An area of 631 ha of core habitat was acquired by Fundaci√≥n ProAves with the support of Fundaci√≥n Loro Parque, American Bird Conservancy and IUCN Netherlands and is now managed as Loro Coroniazul Bird Reserve: surrounding municipality land is also being managed for the species (P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999, 2008). Another protected area, the Giles-Fuertesi Bird Reserve located in Cajamarca, was recently created with the support of Fundaci√≥n Loro Parque and comprises nearly 300 ha at 3,200-3,700 m, including areas of cloud-forest (Anon. 2010, ABC 2012). This reserve will become a centre for research focussed on this species, including studies into its habitat use, behaviour and reproduction (Anon. 2010).The Threatened Parrots of the Cordillera Central project has been working with local communities to restore degraded forest habitats and protect existing habitat (Anon. 2014a).

Recent surveys suggest that the number of locations and mature individuals are both declining, and consequently it qualifies as Critically Endangered. ","It inhabits dense mangrove swamps, where it feeds on insects, larvae, spiders and some vegetable matter (Dvorak et al. 1997, Vargas 1997, Dvorak et al. 2004, Fessl et al. 2011). Its breeding season coincides with the beginning of heavy rainfalls, normally in December and January, and generally lasts until the end of the rainy season, around May, although successful nesting has been recorded as late as September (G. Young in litt. 2011). Nests are placed in tall trees within patches of high mangroves that are often flooded at high tide, a habitat that is rare on the Gal√°pagos (Fessl et al. 2011). Mangroves used by the species in the north-west appear to be structurally different from areas where it is absent suggesting it has subtle habitat preferences and suffers from habitat degradation (Dvorak et al. 2004,&#160;Fessl et al. 2011). It appears to favour mangroves with tall trees, relatively low canopy cover and abundant leaf litter and dead wood (Dvorak et al. 2004,&#160;Fessl et al. 2011). A separation of the mangroves from the sea seems to be crucial as this prevents the washing out of leaf litter etc., which represents the species's preferred feeding substrates (Dvorak et al. 2004,&#160;Fessl et al. 2011). ","This species is declining owing to predation and disease as a result of the presence of invasive species. Rattus rattus abundance is high at both breeding sites and is believed to be the major reason for the high nesting failure due to predation (70% in 2007) and low fledgling success (Fessl et al. 2010). Other possible introduced predators include feral cats (especially important during the post-fledging phase), Smooth-billed Ani Crotophaga ani and fire ants Solenopsis spp., although fire ants seemed to have been successfully exterminated in 1997 (Grant and Grant 1997, Vargas 1997, 1999). The blood-sucking nest parasite Philornis downsi represents a significant threat, as it is present in all nests and infestation is high (with a mean of 42 parasites per nest). The first case of nesting mortality due to Philornis parasitisation was recorded in 2007, and this threat is becoming relatively more prominent as invasive rodents are now controlled (G. Young in litt. 2012). Avian pox may also represent a significant threat to the species. Moreover, due to the low population size, the species is inherently susceptible to the effects of inbreeding (Fessl et al. 2010), loss of genetic diversity and hybridization with the congeneric Woodpecker Finch Geospiza pallida (Lawson et al. 2017). Research has shown that the species favours structurally distinct mangroves and hence may be susceptible to human modification of this habitat, and it may be especially susceptible to sea level rise driven by climate change (D. Wiedenfeld in litt. 2012). Habitat loss through the felling of large trees and collection of wood for fires may be a threat near Puerto Villamil (Young et al. 2013).",The population is estimated to number 50-100 individuals (G. Young in litt. 2013) and 40-80 mature individuals (F. Cunninghame and G Young in litt. 2013).,Decreasing,"This species is restricted to the Gal√°pagos Islands, Ecuador. Historically, it was known from at least six mangrove patches on east Fernandina and east, south and west Isabela (Vargas 1997). In 1974, the population was estimated to comprise 100-200 individuals (R. Naveen in litt. 1988). Recent surveys have failed to record the species on Fernandina, and it seems likely that it is now extinct as a breeding bird on the island - the last reported sighting may have been in 1971 (Grant and Grant 1997). In 1997 and 1998, surveys on Isabela found breeding populations in only two areas, Playa Tortuga Negra and Caleta Black on the north-west coast of the island, with estimated populations of 37 and 21 pairs respectively (Grant and Grant 1997, Vargas 1997). Subsequent surveys have estimated the population at 36 and 16 pairs in 1999 (Vargas 1999), 24 and 14 pairs in 2007 (B. Fessl in litt. 2007), and perhaps the most thorough surveys to date recorded c. 40 pairs in each in 2009 (Fessl et al. 2010). Surveys in the fairly extensive mangroves on the south-east coast of Isabela found three to five territories which probably contained breeding birds, but further areas of potentially suitable habitat remain unsurveyed (Dvorak et al. 1997, Dvorak et al. 2004). In 2008, several other historical sites were surveyed including Punta Espinoza (Fernandina), Bahia Elizabeth, Punta Moreno and Bahia Urbina, but the only site at which birds were located was Cartago Bay (Fessl et al. 2010, G. Young and B. Fessl in litt. 2008), from which the species is now thought extirpated, with no records from the area since 2009 (G. Young in litt. 2012).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayThe habitat of this species is protected within the Gal√°pagos National Park and, in 1979, the islands were declared a World Heritage Site, although this was classified as threatened in 2007. An action plan was published 2010 (in English and Spanish) following a workshop in 2008. Predator control is ongoing as are studies into the control of Philornis downsi, with a workshop on this specific subject held in early 2012 (G. Young and B. Fessl in litt. 2008, G. Young in litt. 2011, Fessl et al. 2010, Charles Darwin Foundation 2014). A study of breeding biology commenced in 1999 (Vargas 1999) and a follow up study started in 2006. Blood samples are being analysed to investigate the genetic structure of the remaining population and to clarify whether hybridisation is occurring, although preliminary results for the latter are negative (H. Vargas and F. Cruz in litt. 2000). Preliminary results, however, do appear to indicate that the species is highly inbred (Fessl et al. 2010). A Darwin Initiative funded Mangrove Finch project coordinated by Gal√°pagos National Park, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Charles Darwin Foundation began in 2007 (G. Young in litt. 2007) with the aim of clarifying the need and proceedings for a breeding or translocation project. Possible sites for reintroduction have been visited on Isabela and habitat suitability assessments undertaken. Remote mapping of mangrove has taken place throughout Isabela with the aim of locating suitable sites, and captive trials have used Woodpecker Finch in order to train personnel and develop husbandry techniques that were then transferred to Mangrove Finch (G. Young and B. Fessl in litt. 2008). The first trial translocation took place in May 2010 when nine wild-trapped birds were taken to Bahia Urbina (25 km south of Playa Tortuga Negra) following intense rat control at this site (Cunninghame et al. 2011). Translocated birds proved hardy and, while able to find sufficient food and habitat at release site, may have returned to their source site (where one male was recorded after c.6 months). A conservation education programme has engaged local schoolchildren, and produced a film highlighting the species's importance. A course has been run for local guides (G. Young in litt. 2011). In 2014, the head-starting of young was trialled, when 15 hand-reared fledglings could be released in Playa Tortuga Negra, followed by another 8 juveniles released in 2015 (Cunninghame et al. 2015).Conservation and Research Actions ProposedContinue to survey for further populations. Establish yearly monitoring at Playa Tortuga Negra and Caleta Black. Continue control measures for rats, wasps, ants, cats and fire ants at Playa Tortuga Negra and Caleta Black, and monitor effects on the population (Grant and Grant 1997). Further study the impact of Philornis downsi on adults and nestlings, and develop effective control methods, which may include application of control agents directly into nests (D. Wiedenfeld in litt. 2012), pheromone disturbance, or the release of sterile males (Charles Darwin Foundation 2014). Study the impact of Galapagos Hawk Buteo galapagoensis. Facilitate printing of the species action plan in Spanish and English (G. Young in litt. 2011). Restore the Ramsar site at Vilamill. Establish translocation techniques to re-establish individuals at former sites following rat control, using head-started young birds less likely to return to their natal site (G. Young in litt. 2012). A recent study found that some species of Darwin's finches can be encouraged to 'self-fumigate' their nests through the provision of permethrin-treated cotton fibres, resulting in the significantly fewer Philornis downsi and more successfully fledged offspring. It is suggested this may be an effective method of reducing nestling mortality for the Mangrove Finch (Knutie et al. 2014). ",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

","It inhabits montane evergreen and tropical deciduous forest, and Scalesia-zone humid scrub (Stotz et al. 1996) mainly at elevations of 300-400 m (O'Connor et al. 2010a). Territory densities amount to 1.7-2.9 territories per ha (Dvorak et al. 2017). It feeds on insects, nectar, young buds and leaves, probing crevices in the bark of trees and searching under twigs and foliage (Castro and Phillips 1996). ","The most significant threat is from the introduced ectoparasite Philornis downsi, which occurs in finch nests on Floreana (Wiedenfeld et al. 2007), and is responsible for 41% of nestling mortality (O'Connor et al. 2010a, S. Kleindorfer in litt. 2008). In 2004-2008 nesting success was extremely low in all years (4-8 % of all nests producing fledglings), 28% of nestlings were predated, and parasite intensity from P. downsi was second highest of any bird species studied so far on the Gal√°pagos archipelago (O'Connor et al. 2010a). It is thought to be at elevated risk from fly parasitism because its only extant habitat is adjacent to cleared agricultural land with fruiting trees which are favoured by the adult fly (S. Kleindorfer in litt. 2008). Floreana has a suite of introduced predators and herbivores including cattle, donkeys, pigs, cats, dogs and rats (Jackson 1985), and suffers from extensive habitat destruction and degradation as a result of agriculture (Cruz and Cruz 1996), habitat alteration by invasive plant species, and free-ranging domestic livestock (H. Vargas and F. Cruz in litt. 2000). Avian pox (Avipox virus) occurs on the island and infects a significant proportion of individuals. Predator marks from invasive rodents increased threefold between 2004-2008, and tourist visitation to favoured Scalesia habitat has increased more than tenfold since 2004 (S. Kleindorfer in litt. 2008). Having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International unpublished data). The species also appears to be at risk from hybridization with Geospiza psittacula and Geospiza parvula, which may have already resulted in the local extinction of G. psittacula on Floreana (Kleindorfer et al. 2014).","The maximum size of the population was estimated at 1,660 individuals in 2008.

Recent estimates put the total population at not more than 1,660 individuals, and it has recently begun declining rapidly owing to the effects of the introduced dipterid parasite Philornis downsi (O'Connor et al. 2010ab). Its largest population can be found around the base of the volcano Cerro Pajas, where its preferred nesting tree Scalesia pedunculata is dominant (O'Connor et al. 2010a). ",,Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayThe Gal√°pagos National Park was gazetted in 1959, and includes almost all the land area of the islands. Although the park incorporates most of Floreana, it does not include the agricultural zone of the island, an area which was the prime habitat for Medium Tree-finch. In 1979, the islands were declared a World Heritage Site (Jackson 1985). In December 2006, the Gal√°pagos National Park began the eradication of goats and donkeys on Floreana which successfully reduced their population to negligible numbers (J. O'Connor in litt. 2010). The Gal√°pagos National Park places rat baiting stations around the Critically Endangered Gal√°pagos Petrel&#160;Pterodroma phaeopygia&#160;breeding colony in the centre of Cerro Pajas, which may also reduce nest predation of Medium Tree-finches in the immediate area (J. O'Connor in litt. 2010). Methods to control or eradicate Philornis downsi are currently being trialled by researchers and visiting scientists at the Charles Darwin Research Station (J. O'Connor in litt. 2010). Conservation and Research Actions ProposedInvestigate methods to control or eradicate Philornis downsi. Continue to monitor the population size.

Individual birds have been observed apparently acting as sentries for conspecifics within a flock (Venturini et al. 2005). The diet is reportedly arthropods (Bauer et al. 2000). Nest-building has been observed in late November (Venturini et al. 2002). It has been recorded living to over six years of age (Venturini et al. 2005).","Extensive deforestation within its range must have had a severe impact on this species. Forests within Itarana, where the species was recorded in 1941, have since been reduced to a number of small fragments. However, the species has been recorded in Eucalyptus spp. and Pinus spp. plantations using this suboptimal habitat while moving between fragments. Threats associated with the loss of forest include quarrying of limestone, granite and marble, illegal palm extraction, the expansion of coffee plantations, small-scale firewood-cutting, and larger-scale timber-cutting, including for charcoal production (Hilty 2011).","This species has now been recorded from three locations with a minimum of 14 individuals known from Pindobas IV and Mata do Caet√©s, and confirmation that it occurs in Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve.

The species's habitat is under severe threat from sand mining activity and other developments, such as for housing or fish farming. Additionally, the invasion of the marsh by the introduced grass&#160;Urochloa arrecta and ginger lily Hedychium coronarium appears to render the marshes unsuitable for the species, and represents a considerable threat (Buzzetti&#160;et al.&#160;2013, Del-Rio et al. 2017).","Current threats arise from anything affecting the tiny patchwork of marshes that form the entire range of the species. Within the last 100 years, the marshlands around Sao Paulo have been almost completely lost (Del-Rio et al. 2015). In particular, sand mining activity, agriculture and other developments such as for housing or fish farming have been identified (Buzzetti et al. 2013). The invasion of marshes in the species range by two invasive plants, the grass&#160;Urochloa arrecta and the ginger lilly Hedychium coronarium, appears to render the marshes unsuitable for the species, and is a considerable threat (Buzzetti&#160;et al.&#160;2013, Del-Rio et al. 2017).","The population was initially estimated at between 250 and 300 individuals, but genetic analysis demonstrated an effective population size of approximately 50 birds in each of the three largest populations, estimated to represent a census size of between 220-582 individuals within approximately 60% of the total area of marsh habitat within the sites where the species has been recorded (Camargo&#160;et al.&#160;2015). Accordingly, the population of the species can be placed with good confidence in the band 250-1,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 166-667 mature individuals which is rounded here to 150-700 mature individuals. The genetic structure of the subpopulations has been investigated and suggests that even though the species is highly restricted in range, there is a considerable degree of genetic differentiation between the three sites holding the largest number of individuals, indicating a minimum of three subpopulations within the species (Camargo&#160;et al.&#160;2015).

It is usually seen following mixed-species flocks, even during the breeding season, but isolated pairs have been observed. The diet includes insects such as beetles and cockroaches. Breeding probably occurs from November-February. A nest has been found in the dense foliage of a middle-stratum tree, c.10-12&#160;m above the ground. ","There has been massive clearance of Atlantic forest in Alagoas and Pernambuco, largely as a result of logging and conversion to sugarcane plantations and pastureland.

For these reasons it qualifies as Critically Endangered.  ","The species occurs in the understory of dense cloud-forest at elevations of 1,800-2,100 m. ","In 1990, habitat at the type-locality was reportedly undisturbed above 1,150&#160;m, but deforestation was proceeding rapidly in the area (M.&#160;Pearman in litt. 1995).

It has a very small known range, within which its extremely small population is subject to continuing pressure from agriculture and the development of recreational facilities. It is consequently listed as Critically Endangered.  ","It inhabits the lower and middle strata of tall, second growth forest (especially where there is an abundance of vines), edge and adjacent clearings, preferring more humid areas of moist forest near springs and streams (Coelho and Silva 1998, J. Mazar Barnett and G. M. Kirwan in litt. 2000). It reportedly feeds on small fruits of Clidemia biserrata (Gaiotti et al. 2017), Cordia spp. (Coelho and Silva 1998) and Cecropia spp. Recently studies have already identified 21 other plant species (Linhares in litt. 2007, Aquasis in litt. 2010), but also arthropods (beetles, spiders and ants; Gaiotti et al. 2017) as part of its diet. It typically occurs in pairs and breeds in November-April (Aquasis 2006); immature males have been found in March and January (J. Mazar Barnett and G. M. Kirwan in litt. 2000, J. Minns in litt. 2000). Vocal activity among males is thought to peak between 10h00 and 14h00, and be at its highest during September and October, when rainfall is at its lowest; breeding follows during the wet season when c.76% of tree species bordering gallery forests occupied by Araripe Manakin are fruiting (Gir√£o and Souto 2005, K. V. Linhares in litt. 2007). Until recently, all nests discovered had been in vegetation overhanging watercourses (K. V. Linhares in litt. 2007, Linhares et al. 2010), but the recent discovery of a new location in dense forest away from running water suggests this species may not be as reliant on springs and streams as was previously thought (Aquasis 2012). Surveys in 2004-2007 recorded nests in 11 plant species belonging to eight families, most frequently Melastomataceae, Rubiaceae and Piperaceae (Linhares et al. 2010). Most of the plants used were shrubs (c.36%) or trees (c.46%), although few trees were in their adult phase (Linhares et al. 2010). A clutch of two eggs was observed being incubated solely by the female, while the male vocally defended the territory (Albano and Gir√£o 2009). Despite the ongoing loss and fragmentation of the habitat, there is no evidence of genetic substructuring, and the genetic diversity seems to be fairly high (R√™go et al. 2010).","Lowlands adjacent to the Chapada have been largely cleared for agriculture (especially banana, maize, beans and tomatoes), cattle raising and the construction of homes (Aquasis 2006). There are several recreational facilities along the slopes of the Chapada do Araripe. These include large open parks and swimming pools, which have involved deforestation in their development, particularly in areas where there is spring water. A large recreational water-park was built at the type-locality in 2000 (Aquasis 2006), but a small patch of habitat is being conserved there, and the species persists despite the disturbance (A. B. Hennessey in litt. 2005). Fires in 2004-2005 largely destroyed an area of forest known to contain seven active nests of the species. Another fire in September 2010 affected the same area, as well as other areas where the species is known to occur (Aquasis in litt. 2010). The springs that supply the streams which support the moist forest habitat of the species have shown an average reduction of 75% in their outflow over the past hundred years, possibly due to deforestation on the slopes and plateau of the Chapada do Araripe, posing a long-term threat to the species's remaining habitat. Diversion, channelling and piping of the springs and streams are also reducing the area of available gallery forest habitat (Aquasis 2006). The species is not known to be trapped either by wildlife traders or by the local population for pets (Aquasis 2006). ","In 2006, population size was estimated at 800 individuals based on two consecutive years of auditive censuses. A census at the end of 2010, which visited 93% of the known water springs, represents the most comprehensive survey of the species ever, and resulted in an estimate of 779 individuals (Aquasis in litt. 2011). It is placed in the band 250-999 individuals to account for uncertainty; this equates to 167-666 mature individuals, rounded here to 150-700 mature individuals. Following detailed survey work, Aquasis (2014) estimates that there are as many as 279 adult males in the population.",Decreasing,"This species was described in 1998 and has been recorded from three municipalities (Crato, Barbalha and Missao Velha), all on the north-eastern slope of the Chapada do Araripe, south Cear√°, Brazil (Coelho and Silva 1998, Aquasis 2006). Surveys conducted in 2005-2006 and 2010 have led to a population estimate of c. 800 individuals, which is higher than previously thought (Aquasis 2006, Aquasis in litt. 2011), within a remaining area of suitable habitat estimated at 28 km2 (Aquasis 2006). The breeding area is estimated at 10 km2 (Aquasis 2014). A total of 46 nests were located in 2004-2007 (Aquasis in litt. 2010). The discovery of the species at a new locality on the top of the Araripe plateau, in January 2012, suggests that its population size and distribution may be slightly greater than previously estimated (Aquasis 2012).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIn December 2014 two reserves were established for the species. A 140 acre area, the Oasis Araripe Reserve, was acquired by Aquasis (a local NGO) with support from the American Bird Conservancy (Anon. 2015), whilst a neighbouring land owner designated 27 acres as a fully protected area (Anon. 2014). The 140 acre area borders the Araripe National Forest and is connected to the Sitio Fund√£o State Park (230 acres, fully protected and managed by the state government) (Anon. 2014). In 2016, the reserve was expanded by an additional 170 acres (American Bird Conservancy 2016). Aquasis&#160;are in discussions with other landowners concerning the protection of 50-60 ha areas within the species's range (Aquasis 2014, Panela 2015).&#160;Aquasis, working in partnership with the American Bird Conservancy, have also conducted a programme of reforestation in the Chapado do Araripe with more than 4,500 native tree seedlings planted as of December 2014 (Panela 2015). Plans are in place to plant 5,000 saplings of 15 native tree species in the newly acquired Oasis Araripe Reserve in 2015 (Anon. 2015). The type-locality is within the Chapada do Araripe Environmental Protection Area, which is adjacent to Araripe National Forest, but both are designated ""sustainable use"" and consequently fail to prevent exploitation or disturbance of habitat (Aquasis 2006). The owner of the land adjacent to the type-locality decided to protect the remaining forest following the discovery of this species (A. G. Coelho in litt. 1997,&#160;Coelho and Silva 1998,&#160;J. Mazar Barnett and G. M. Kirwan in litt. 2000). Progress is ongoing to develop a network of protected areas in the Araripe Plateau area: the Ara√ß√° Private Reserve was created in October 2014 and is likely to become a Private Reserve of Natural Heritage (RPPN) (Aquasis 2014). The Conservation Leadership Programme (CLP) has supported the Conservation of the Araripe Manakin Project in the Chapada do Araripe region since 2004, conducted by Aquasis. In 2007, the project was granted a new award after several years of intensive research into the species's ecological requirements and conservation status, and the development of a conservation plan for the Araripe Manakin; the project team is now focusing on establishing a fully protected area in the Chapada do Araripe that encompasses the remaining moist forest habitat and other areas deemed suitable for habitat restoration (Aquasis 2006, Aquasis in litt. 2010). This process is on-going, and collaborations have been established with several local stakeholders to address various aspects of sustaining long-term conservation actions, including raising awareness and initiating habitat restoration (Aquasis in litt. 2010). Ministry of Environment representatives made a preliminary visit to the site in October 2011 (Aquasis in litt. 2012). The CLP was supporting the Araripe Manakin conservation project again in 2010, with the main objectives of establishing a visitor centre, facilitating and monitoring the process of establishing a fully protected area in the Chapada do Araripe, and encouraging and supporting the formation of local birdwatching groups (Aquasis in litt. 2010). The Araripe Manakin Conservation Project Visitor Center is now established and efforts are ongoing to develop new exhibits and educational campaigns (Aquasis 2014). In addition to the local fire service and a specially trained fire brigade that responds to fires in conservation areas, a new fire brigade was being established in the municipality of Crato during 2010 to further increase the response capacity (Aquasis in litt. 2010). The species conservation plan for&#160;the species was revised in April 2010, together with ICMBio (a Brazilian environmental organisation), and the federal government is expected to publish a decree recognising its legality (Aquasis in litt. 2010). Activities are now underway for the development of an update to the National Action Plan (Aquasis 2014). With support from BirdLife International's Preventing Extinctions Programme the most thorough census yet of the species's known population began in 2012 (Aquasis&#160;2014).&#160;Surveys were&#160;carried out at sites around Crato in 2013/2014, with more surveys in the municipalities of Barbalha and Miss√£o Velha planned for 2014/2015 (Aquasis 2014). This work has identified new sites where the species is present and areas to target in future surveys but because the methods used are different to previous surveys, assessing population trends is not yet possible (Aquasis 2014). The survey data have been made available to protected area managers in order to inform management decisions (Aquasis 2014). Aquasis (2012, 2014) is involved in a number of local environmental discussion forums.Conservation Actions ProposedSurvey similar habitats throughout north-east Brazil during September and October between 10h00 and 14h00 when male calling activity is at its peak (Coelho and Silva 1998, Gir√£o and Souto 2005, J. Mazar Barnett and G. M. Kirwan in litt. 2000) to locate additional populations.&#160;Formally protect remaining habitat as a national wildlife refuge or national park. In 2010, Aquasis led a group of stakeholders in a formal request for the creation of a strict protected area along the slopes of Chapada do Araripe. After a brief field visit in 2011 by government officials, no further action was taken by environmental authorities, and by early 2016 the process was still pending at the Brazilian Ministry of Environment (Aquasis in litt. 2016). Provide incentives for landowners to establish a network of private reserves as a buffer zone (Coelho and Silva 1998). Work with environmental and water management authorities to protect springs and streams along the slopes of the Chapada, and their associated gallery forests (Aquasis 2006). Conduct awareness campaigns in the Araripe region to engender pride in biodiversity and water resources, using the species as a symbol for the conservation of the entire Chapada (Aquasis 2006). Promote and facilitate research on humid forest ecosystem services, as well as species composition and ecology, in order to support future conservation actions related to habitat recovery and restoration (Aquasis 2006, Aquasis in litt. 2010). Minimise or eliminate disturbance and clearance of vegetation along watercourses during the species's nesting season (Linhares et al. 2010).

Pre-montane forest cover is estimated to be 3-4% of its original extent (Cuervo et al. 2001). The species is presumed to have been extirpated from a large part of its range (Renjifo et al. 2002), with almost 9% of habitat lost between 2000 and 2010 (Cuervo 2014). Forest loss is driven by mining and agriculture, in particular coffee, plantain and cattle (Cuervo et al. 2001, Renjifo et al. 2002). While until recently political instability hampered human activities in the area, the current stability favours high rates of colonization, which likely increases deforestation in the area (Fundaci√≥n ProAves 2011). Construction of several major hydro-electric dams within the species's range threatens remaining habitat as does the development of road networks and gold mining and exploration (Fundaci√≥n ProAves 2011). High acidity and poor soil drainage reduce vegetation succession and accentuate problems of soil erosion (Renjifo et al. 2002). Afforestation with exotic species is an increasing problem in the area (Cuervo et al. 2001). The species can only tolerate habitat fragmentation if the remaining fragments are large (&gt; 70 ha) and interconnected (Cuervo et al. 2008). Climate change is feared to put another strain on the species, as its climatically suitable range is projected to disappear by the year 2050 (Vel√°squez-Tibat√° et al. 2012).","The population size has not been quantified however estimates range from fewer than 2,500 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 2004) to fewer than 250 individuals (Cuervo 2014). It is precautionarily placed in the band 50-249 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;is confined to a small area of forest (c. 800 km2) on the northern slope of the Central Andes in Colombia (Cuervo et al. 2001), it had been known from just five locations (Renjifo et al. 2002) however it is now known from 16 sites (Cuervo et al. 2008, Cuervo 2014, Sharpe 2015, Snow and Sharpe 2015). The area lies between the Porce and Nech√≠ river valleys, where it is presently known from four localities in the Municipality of Anor√≠ (Cuervo et al. 2001). The species was considered to be locally common at the known localities in Anor√≠, especially between 1,600 and 1,750 m&#160; (Cuervo et al. 2001, Renjifo et al. 2002). It is much less common near Amalfi, presumably because the forests in this area have been subject to exploitation for a longer period of time (Renjifo et al. 2002). ",,Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayThe species is classified as Critically Endangered in Colombia and listed as the eighth most threatened species in Colombia (Cuervo 2014, Fundaci√≥n ProAves 2014, D. Lebbin in litt. 2015). La Reserva Natural La Forzosa, a fragment of pristine forest of 4.5 km2 between 1,500 and 1,820 m, has been designated following an ornithological exploration of the area (Cuervo et al. 2001, Renjifo et al. 2002). 1,310 acres of forest were purchased by the American Bird Conservancy to be managed by Fundaci√≥n ProAves as the Arrierito Antioque√±o Bird Reserve in 2006 (Anon 2006/2007). It is also found in La Serrana and Caracol√≠-Guayabito reserves (Cuervo 2014). These reserves protect a suite of bird species of conservation concern in addition to L. weberi (Sharpe 2015).Conservation&#160;and Research&#160;Actions ProposedConduct detailed surveys to determine the extent of its distribution, population status, and genetic variation and exchange between the Amalfi and Anor√≠ populations (Renjifo et al. 2002). Develop a management plan for the species. Pursue the protection of remaining pre-montane forest fragments in the region, particularly those persisting in the Riach√≥n river valley in Amalfi (Renjifo et al. 2002). Control exploitation of palms and other forest resources. Encourage the local government to acquire land between 1,200 and 1,600 m for future protected areas. Encourage alternative technologies for the use of the land, and campaign to prevent the conversion of forests to pastures (Renjifo et al. 2002). There remain some large intact and potentially suitable subtropical forest areas in eastern and southeastern Antioquia. Conservation efforts in these areas may prove more practical and probably reveal healthy populations of this and other threatened species (Salaman in litt. 2003, Sharpe 2015). Protect Bosque El Guayabito from deforestation (Fundaci√≥n ProAves in litt. 2012).

666,South America,Cinclodes palliatus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PASSERIFORMES,AVES,FURNARIIDAE,Cinclodes,palliatus,C2a(i),This species is now thought to have an extremely small population which is assumed to be in continuing decline owing to habitat destruction and degradation (Collar et al. 1992). Further surveys of suitable habitat have failed to find the species at any additional localities. It is therefore considered Critically Endangered. Urgent conservation action is required to preserve and restore remaining habitat. ,"It inhabits boggy terrain from 4,430 m to the snowline at c.5,000 m (G. Engblom in litt. 2003, J. Barrio in litt. 2012, Remsen and Sharpe 2015). It appears to have very specific habitat requirements: mineral-rich, well-watered cushion-plant (e.g. Distichia) bogs with rocky outcrops and stony slopes nearby, often below glaciers (Fjelds√• and Krabbe 1990). Birds are usually seen in pairs or small groups of 3-4 individuals (Fjelds√• and Krabbe 1990), with a maximum of 6-7 birds in a group, rarely up to 12&#160; (J. Barrio in litt. 2012). When feeding, it probes vegetation for ""worms"", small frogs and insects (Remsen and Sharpe 2015). Its breeding ecology is unknown, except that the nest is placed in a crevice or under rocks (J. Barrio in litt. 2012); nests have been found in November, and fledglings in December and January (Remsen and Sharpe 2015).","Suitable habitat was previously subjected to relatively little human disturbance owing to its high altitude. However, the use of peat for mushroom-growing, private gardening and public parks in Lima has increased in the past ten years, and bogs are rapidly destroyed as their soil is transported to Lima (G. Engblom in litt. 2003). Some suitable habitat is apparently being overgrazed by alpacas, llamas and sheep (J. Barrio in litt. 2009). Mining operations are also causing habitat degradation through the dumping of deposits in bogs and lakes, and through the deliberate draining of some bogs, an activity that is estimated to be affecting over 50% of suitable sites (J. Barrio in litt. 2012). In addition, wetland areas in its range are threatened by water extraction for agriculture (C. Aucca Chutas in litt. 2008). The chances of this species surviving will greatly diminish if peat extraction and habitat alteration continue. Furthermore, having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International unpublished data). ","The population was estimated at between 200 and 1,000 individuals in 2003 (G. Engblom in litt. 2003). Further surveys have failed to find records of the species at additional localities, hence the population is thought to be at the lower end of this estimate or perhaps even lower (J. Barrio in litt. 2009; R. E. Gibbons in litt. 2009). Therefore, the population is best placed in the band 50-249 mature individuals. This equates to 75-374 individuals in total, rounded here to 70-400 individuals.",Decreasing,"Cinclodes palliatus is rare and very local in the high Andes of Peru in Jun√≠n, immediately adjacent Lima and (at least formerly) Huancavelica. Between 1952 and 2008, the majority of records came from six sites, confined within an area of c.24 km diameter, with a specimen from the Cordillera de Huayhuash, Lima (L. Salinas per J. Barrio in litt. 2012) and a single sighting of a stray bird near Lago de Jun√≠n (Jun√≠n) in 1978 (Harris 1980, Fjelds√• and Krabbe 1990). The type-specimen was collected at Monta√±a de V√≠toc in the large massif west of La Oroya, Jun√≠n, drained by the r√≠o V√≠toc. There have been no subsequent records in the localities in Huancavelica where specimens were collected in the 1930s and 1940s (Harris 1980), despite detailed surveys in 2009 (J. Barrio in litt. 2012), and further searches of suitable habitat have failed to find any record of the species between Huancavelica and Ayacucho departments, where it was incorrectly reported (J. Barrio&#160;in litt. 2012).&#160;A large survey from 2008 to 2011, throughout the distributional range, indicated that a 40 km strip in the central area of the distribution is the stronghold for the species, with 75% of the bogs there inhabited by White-bellied Cinclodes (J. Barrio in litt. 2012).&#160;It is rare and local, being absent from large areas of apparently suitable habitat, and may be declining. In 2003, 28 individuals were counted at six known sites (G. Engblom in litt. 2003), and given the number of suitable bogs within its range it was suggested that the global population may potentially number as many as 200-1,000 individuals (G. Engblom in litt. 2003), but is probably closer to the lower figure (J. Barrio in litt. 2009, R. E. Gibbons in litt. 2009). During the surveys from 2008 to 2011, 104 bogs were searched yielding 113 individuals at 18 of these (J. Barrio in litt. 2012). Given the number of suitable bogs within its range it is now believed that the global population may number less than 300 individuals, which would include fewer than 250 mature individuals (J. Barrio in litt. 2012).&#160;",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species's distribution and population dynamics were studied between 2008 and 2010 (J.

Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to conduct surveys to better determine its current distribution and population size, especially in the highlands north central Huancavelica (J. Barrio in litt. 2012). Assess its precise ecological requirements to determine reasons for this species's apparently restricted range and rarity.

However, it has now also been found in Bandeira county, in the border of the Pardo and Jequitinhonha valleys, Minas Gerais and Bahia, where its extremely small range and population, at a single location, is declining owing to fires, logging and the clearance of steep humid valley-floor forest for cattle-ranching and agriculture. The entire population may now number just 10-15 individuals. For these reasons it is classified as Critically Endangered. ","Very little is known, but its behaviour and habitat preferences appear similar to those of M. ater (Baudet 2001). The male in 1995 was observed foraging on the ground and on fallen tree trunks in an area of drier forest between two humid valleys (Baudet 2001). The species is found in the understorey of mature humid forest, often comprised of Cecropia spp., at 600-930 metres along the Jequitinonha and Pardo River valleys (R. Ribon in litt 2007, Damasceno 2011). The species has been observed apparently feeding on insects on dry litter and under fallen logs (Funda√ß√£o Biodiversitas in litt. 2010). Birds are very responsive to play-back, approaching the observer to 2 m (R. Ribon in litt 2007), and move mainly by walking or short-distance flights (Damasceno 2011). The average territory size of three birds was 2.36 ha, based on initial studies, but more data are required (Funda√ß√£o Biodiversitas in litt. 2010). The first known nest site was found in 2012, and consisted of a tennis-ball sized hole c.3 feet above the ground in an exposed dirt bank with overhanging vegetation, with a nesting tunnel estimated to be c.6 feet deep (ABC 2013).","Most humid forest in Bahia has been cleared or converted to cacao plantations, and remaining patches are disappearing very rapidly. Forest in the Minas Gerais and Bahia border area is being cleared for small (mostly in Jord√¢nia county, Minas Gerais) and large scale cattle ranching (R. Ribon in litt 2007). Forest is also degraded by loggers from Bahia state (R. Ribon in litt 2007). Intentional or accidental fires are set every year, degrading the border of the remaining pristine forest (R. Ribon in litt 2007). ","In the Jequitinhonha valley (the sole currently known population), at least four birds were found in a 100 ha area, but it was thought unlikely that this density could be extrapolated for the whole 5,000 ha partly fragmented patch of forest (R. Ribon in litt. 2006). Surveys of the Macarani / Bandeira area near Balbina (Sossego do Arrebol Forest) found just six individuals: five females and a single male (Funda√ß√£o Biodiversitas in litt. 2010). Three males were recorded in 2012 (WikiAves 2013) but there are likely no more than 10-15 birds in total and none have been found in other forest fragments surveyed (R. Ribon in litt. 2011). It is therefore now suspected that there may be fewer than 50 birds remaining, and the population is placed in the band 1-49 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Merulaxis stresemanni was known until relatively recently from just two specimens, the type, collected near Salvador in the 1830s, and a second taken near Ilh√©us in 1945, in coastal Bahia, Brazil. In 1995, it was rediscovered in the wild when a male was observed and tape-recorded at Fazenda Jueirana, near Una Biological Reserve, Bahia (Baudet 2001). Subsequent searches there have failed to produce further records (Baudet 2001, F. Olmos in litt. 2003). However, the species was subsequently found in the Jequitinhonha valley, Minas Gerais, near the border with Bahia (Ribon et al. 2004). Here, too, the future of the species seems to hang in the balance: it lives in a strip of humid valley-floor forest, much of which has recently been cleared to make room for agriculture (F. Olmos in litt. 2006) and pasture (R. Ribon in litt 2007). ",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIt is considered Critically Endangered at the national level in Brazil (MMA 2014), and protected by Brazilian law. The sighting in 1995 was in a privately-owned fazenda adjacent to the 5,400 ha Una Biological Reserve. A reforestation project aiming to create a biological corridor between Una and Serra das Lontras is planned (F. Olmos in litt. 2003). Ten percent of the forest tract where the species was discovered in Macarani County in 2005 (the 400 ha Mata da Balbina in Jequitinhonha valley, Bandeira and Macarani municipalities) was purchased by the Funda√ß√£o Biodiversitas, a local NGO from Minas Gerais, with funds from the American Bird Conservancy, and is managed as Reserva do Passarinho, a Private Natural Heritage Reserve (P. Develey in litt. 2007, Anon 2008, Whitehouse and Ribon 2010). Within an initial three-year period targets were to create an initial infrastructure, investigate the conservation status of M. stresemanni, and enhance the institutional presence in the area (Anon 2008). A further 194 ha section of forest was purchased in March 2009, along with infrastructure improvement and the hiring of a reserve manager (American Bird Conservancy 2009, SAVE Brasil in litt. 2010). All the remaining forest (c.4,300 ha) is virtually unprotected and needs urgent protection (R. Ribon in litt 2007).

668,South America,Ara glaucogularis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PSITTACIFORMES,AVES,PSITTACIDAE,Ara,glaucogularis,A2bcde,"This species qualifies as Critically Endangered because, overall, it is likely to have undergone an extremely rapid population reduction over the past three generations, such that the remaining population is likely to be tiny. However, there are some signs of recovery now. ","It utilises forest islands and gallery forest found fragmented throughout the Beni Savannas at an 80:20 ratio. Motac√∫ palm Attalea phalerata is a principal food of all macaws in the area, with abundances ranging from 0-100% in forest islands in the savannas, and borders of gallery forest. It nests in cavities, hatching 1-3 eggs. Birds living in the north of the&#160;Llanos de Mojos breed around the end of the dry season (September and October) whilst birds in the south breed at the beginning of the wet season (November onwards) (Berkunsky et al. 2014).&#160;Preferred nesting cavities typically have a diameter of 30 cm or more and are found in trees with a diameter at breast height of 60 cm or more (Gould 2013a). The species is most frequently found in pairs, but small groups (7-9) do occur and one large roosting group of 70 is known, thought to be made up of non-breeding birds (I. Berkunsky in litt. 2012, J. Gilardi in litt. 2012). ","It was severely threatened in the past by legal and illegal exploitation for the national and international cage-bird trade (A. Hesse in litt. 1999, I. Berkunsky in litt. 2012), although this has been radically reduced since 1984 (I. Berkunsky in litt. 2012). However in 2010 illegal trading of two recently-poached wild juvenile Blue-throated Macaws was uncovered&#160;(Berkunsky&#160;et al. 2011). The juveniles were eventually released into the wild, however this demonstrates that illegal poaching does still occur. All known breeding sites are on private cattle-ranches, where burning and clearing for pasture and tree-felling for fuel and fence posts have reduced the number of suitable nest trees and inhibited palm regeneration (Duffield and Hesse 1997, Hesse 1998, J. Gilardi in litt. 2012). However, cattle-rearing has occurred in the region since the 17th century (A. Hesse in litt. 1999); thus, the preferred food, the motac√∫ palm Attalea phalerata, has been substantially reduced and is only regenerating slowly (B. Hennessey in litt. 2016). Nest-site competition from other macaws, toucans, bats and large woodpeckers is significant, and disturbance from mammals, birds and human activity may reduce the reproductive output of some pairs (J. Gilardi in litt. 2012). Between 2007 and 2012, 30 nests were monitored. Of these nests, 57% failed, with most failures occurring during incubation (Berkunsky et al. 2014). Reasons for nest failure were diverse but included disease, predation and abandonment. Botfly (Philornis spp.) infestations have been responsible for nest failures as have bees colonising nest sites, extreme weather events and parental neglect (Gould 2013a). Nestlings are vulnerable to predation from: Toco Toucan Ramphastos toco, Crane Hawk Geranospiza caerulescens, Great-horned Owl Bubo virginianus&#160;and Southern-crested Caracara Caracara plancus (Gould 2013a). Hunting to provide feathers for indigenous headdresses probably has an important impact in some areas (I. Berkunsky in litt. 2012). There are fears that inbreeding within an increasingly fragmented population is resulting in reduced fertility (Loro Parque Fundaci√≥n 2003). This is compounded by a lack of recruitment to the breeding population; during a five year study, no new breeding pairs were recruited (Berkunsky&#160;et al. 2014).&#160;Disease also represents a significant threat, particularly in areas where the species shares water sources with other bird species (Gould 2013a). A Population Viability Analysis found that changes in adult mortality had the greatest impact on estimates of extinction probability and population growth rates and that habitat loss and poaching also affected these estimates (Strem and Bouzat 2012).",In 2007 the population was estimated at 250-300 individuals including 70 birds discovered at a dry season roost site&#160;(Waugh 2007). Given the uncertainty over the number of mature individuals this is placed in the band 50-249 until better data are available.,Stable,"Ara glaucogularis is known from the Llanos de Mojos in north Bolivia. There are two subpopulations: the northern subpopulation is found from west of Santa Ana eastwards across the upper r√≠o Mamor√©, Beni, where the wild population was discovered in 1992 (Duffield and Hesse 1997,&#160;Yamashita and Barros 1997), to the eastern savannas; the southern subpopulation is found mostly in the Maraban province in Beni, close to the town of Loreto. In 2007, the total population was estimated to number 250-300 individuals occupying a range of c.4,000 km2, with 70 individuals discovered at a dry season roost site that year (Waugh 2007). An estimated 1,200 or more wild-caught birds were exported from Bolivia during the 1980s, suggesting that the population was formerly much higher (Yamashita and Barros 1997).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I. Officially considered Critically Endangered at the national level in Bolivia (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Agua 2009). Asociaci√≥n Armon√≠a/Loro Parque Fundaci√≥n produced a Blue-throated Macaw Recovery Plan in 2003. It was listed as endangered under the U.S.A. Endangered Species Act in November 2013 (Gould 2013b). Live export from Bolivia was banned in 1984, although illegal export was still evident in 1997 (Duffield and Hesse 1997). The Asociaci√≥n Armon√≠a/Loro Parque Fundaci√≥n parrot trade monitoring project has recorded reduced levels of trade in the species (B. Hennessey in litt. 2008), but the large scale illegal trade infrastructure in Bolivia means there is the potential to start trapping again if there is the demand. Agreement has been reached with some landowners to control access and deter potential trappers, and negotiations with other landowners continue (Hesse 1998, A. Hesse in litt. 1999). Based on field surveys, recommendations have been made that the Paraparau region, Beni department, be given greater conservation priority (Tobias 2003). Much of the remaining population occurs on private ranch-lands. Many landowners are sympathetic to conservation work on their lands and continued support will benefit the species's recovery. Local conservation work has involved planting trees that provide food for the species (Gould 2013a) and a&#160;nest box campaign which has been run since 2004 and has found that there is a great demand for suitable nesting cavities. The active management and monitoring of nest box use has helped to reduce the incidence of nest failure (Berkunsky 2010). A recent study found that birds more readily used nest boxes that were placed in the same tree, or very near to a nest site used in previous years (Berkunsky et al. 2014). Asociaci√≥n Armon√≠a, with the help of the American Bird Conservancy and World Land Trust, completed the purchase of a 3,555 ha private reserve protecting at least 20 Blue-throated Macaw in November 2008&#160;(BirdLife International 2008). The Barba Azul Nature Reserve protects important foraging and roosting sites for over 100 Blue-throated Macaw individuals from March to early November (Asociaci√≥n Armonia in litt.&#160;2016). With additional land purchases, the Barba Azul Nature Reserve was expanded to 5,000 ha (Anon. 2012) and in 2014 was expanded to almost 11,000 ha (Anon. 2014b). The reserve will be used for education, research and tourism and, with the support of Bird Endowment, an additional 100 nest boxes were due to be put in place for the 2008/2009 breeding season&#160;(B. Hennessey&#160;in litt.&#160;2008). In 2017, another 80 nest boxes were added (Asociaci√≥n Armonia 2018). The Loreto population fledged 71 chicks under the Armonia / Loro Parque Fundacion nest box program since 2006 (Asociaci√≥n Armonia 2018). The World Land Trust also carries out nest-box provision, as well as the feeding of nestlings and other manipulations. Nest guarding and monitoring has also been introduced at nests that are particularly vulnerable to predation (Gould 2013a). Other measures include on-going surveys of potential areas where populations may persist; a pet trade monitoring programme in two main Bolivian cities, land acquisition programmes conducted in order to protect key habitat and populations, as well as reforestation programmes for the Motac√∫ palm. There has been a widespread education programme, including pamphlets, posters, T-shirts, presentations, short-wave radio spots, video programmes, TV interviews, travel to the most remote ranches giving presentations on laptops, and creation of interpretation centres in the bottle-neck towns of Trinidad, Santa Rosa and Santa Ana. Artificial feathers have been successfully produced and marketed to local people to replace authentic Blue-throated Macaw feathers used in traditional headdresses (Anon. 2014a). The population in captivity (some of which is held in captive-breeding facilities) is many times larger than the wild population.&#160;In 2009 a formal agreement was signed between the Loro Parque Fundaci√≥n, Asociaci√≥n Armon√≠a, the Zoo Fauna Sudamericana and the Noel Kempff Mercado Natural History Museum which formalises the initiation of a managed cooperative breeding programme in Bolivia (Anon. 2008). Modelling the effect of different management strategies on the population dynamics showed that the reintroduction of 50 adult individuals would double the wild population within 10 years (Maestri et al. 2017).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue nest guarding and monitoring. Expand, monitor and improve nest boxes and the captive-breeding programme. Develop a reintroduction programme. Continue illegal pet trade monitoring and confiscations of all native parrots from traders. Lobby local and national government regarding illegal pet trade. Research and promote the acquisition of land for the species's long-term conservation, studies into habitat requirements and restoration, and sustainable tourism support. Conduct research on Motac√∫ palm to understand how to manage and regenerate the habitat (Gould 2013a). Continue wide-ranging education programmes, especially in Santa Rosa and Santa Ana area - supported by interpretive centres. Promote alternatives to macaw feather head-dress usage. Develop tourism infrastructure on private reserve lands. Maintain a low level of population monitoring and occasional new surveys. Implement field research to identify principal health threats. Further research needed into post-breeding behaviour; a study from 2007 to 2012 suggested that successful pairs do not breed the following year and more work is needed to ascertain how common this behaviour is (Berkunsky et al. 2014). A monitoring project is planned to track movements during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. It is not possible to follow flocks during the non-breeding season due to flooding, so tracking work will provide important information on the species's movements during this period (Berkunsky&#160;et al. 2012).",Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Conservative estimates of numbers suggest that all subpopulations are extremely small. It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered. ,"Its original natural habitat is inter-Andean dry forest, but this has been degraded to thorn and cactus scrub by centuries (if not millennia) of human activity (S. K. Herzog in litt. 2007) and it now inhabits subtropical, xerophytic thorny scrub with many cacti and scattered trees at 1,100-2,700 m, dispersing locally to 3,000 m. It nests and roosts on undisturbed, steep-sided river cliffs, with a small population breeding in palms (Rojas et al. 2012). Its diet includes seeds and fruit, but natural food sources are often scarce and birds feed extensively on crops, particularly groundnuts and unripe maize (Kyle 2005). Egg-laying takes place in February and March, with pairs fledging one, two or occasionally three offspring annually (Juniper and Parr 1998, S. K. Herzog in litt. 2007, A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012, Collar et al. 2015). Adults and their young remain on the breeding grounds until May, after which they congregate in a few large flocks in agricultural areas and roost communally in large trees (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012). Even though the breeding sites are separated by only 10-60 km and individuals from different colonies forage together outside of the breeding season, the species shows a clear genetic sub-structure with almost no gene flow between colonies, which has been attributed to a strong natal phylopatry (J. L. Tella in litt. 2017). ","Its original natural habitat is inter-Andean dry forest but this has been degraded to thorn and cactus scrub by centuries (if not millennia) of highly unsustainable human activities, nowadays mainly overgrazing by goats, firewood cutting and charcoal production (S. K. Herzog in litt. 2007). An estimated 40% of natural vegetation in valleys within its range had been converted to agriculture by 1991, with other areas degraded by intense grazing. Several important food trees are harvested for fuel and charcoal. As food plants are lost, agricultural land is used more, thereby increasing the species's exposure to persecution as a crop-pest, and the use of firearms for pest control has been recorded (Brace et al. 1995). Macaws are also potentially threatened by pesticides applied to crops where macaws forage mostly during the non-breeding season (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012). Illegal trapping continues, but has been reduced as a result of legal protection (Pitter and Christiansen 1995,&#160;Juniper and Parr 1998, Herrera and Hennessey 2007, A. Rojas in litt. 2007). The majority of the Bolivian parrot trade is domestic, but more valuable threatened species end up in Peru or further afield. 26 Red-fronted Macaws were recorded passing through the Los Pozos pet market, Santa Cruz between August 2004-July 2005, and there are four other wildlife markets in the city and others in Cochabamba, suggesting this figure may only represent a small proportion of birds illegally trafficked in the country (Herrera and Hennessey 2007). In 2011, 45 Red-fronted Macaws were recorded in houses; some had been taken from nests as nestlings, but most of them were trapped when foraging in crops. In 2017, more than 100 individuals were found as cage birds in local communities (J. L. Tella in litt. 2017). Most were kept as pets, but some were to sell to in major cities (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012). The two main threats appear to be nest-poaching and trapping for local pet supply, and persecution as crop pests (especially in corn and peanut cultivations), and possibly contamination by pesticides applied to crops (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012, J. L. Tella in litt. 2017). ","The population is estimated to number at most 600 individuals. Taking the most precautionary approach, including only the currently-breeding individuals results in a population estimate of approximately 134-272 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Ara rubrogenys is endemic to a small area on the east Andean slope of south-central Bolivia, from south Cochabamba and west Santa Cruz through north Chuquisaca to north-east Potos√≠. It is principally found in the valley systems of the r√≠os Grande, Mizque, Caine and Pilcomayo. It is locally common but declining, with the population variously estimated at 2,000-4,000 individuals in 1991-1992 (Pitter and Christiansen 1995), or as few as 1,000 in 1991 (Clarke and Duran Pati√±o 1991). In the Caine valley (Cochabamba and Potos√≠) 40-100 individuals were considered resident and secure in 1989-1992, but only one was seen during five days of fieldwork in 1995 (Pitter and Christiansen 1995, Herzog et al. 1997). Conservative estimates in 2007 indicated there were fewer than 500 breeding pairs, although not all nesting colonies had been found, and there were additional non-breeding adults in any given year (S. K. Herzog in litt. 2007). A survey conducted in 2011 (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012) attempted to cover the entire range of the species, locating 34-35 occupied nesting sites in cliffs, of which 16 were previously unknown, as well as a small population breeding in palms (Rojas et al. 2012). The survey counted 130 pairs, of which 67-86 were breeding and the rest probably did not attempt to breed (immature pairs). Non-breeding individuals were aggregated in 7 localities during the breeding season and consisted of 545 individuals, giving a total population (including pairs) of 805 individuals (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012). This survey also showed that 5 out of 28 (18%) of breeding locations known from the previous five years were unoccupied in 2011 (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012). In a precautionary approach including only the currently-breeding individuals, the number of mature individuals was estimated at 134-272. ",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I and II. It is considered nationally Critically Endangered in Bolivia (Rojas et al. 2009). Its capture, transport and export is prohibited under Bolivian law (Fuller and Gaski 1987), although this is not effectively enforced (Herrera and Hennessey 2007). In 1992, 5,000 posters urging the protection of macaws and their habitat were made and apparently well received throughout the region. Non-breeding birds occur in the southern edge of Amboro National Park (S. K. Herzog in litt. 2007, A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012). Two municipal protected areas have been created at Pasorapa (1,796 km2) and Mollepampa-Lagarpampa (303 km2) (J. Cahill in litt. 2012). Armon√≠a has a long-term conservation project on the Rio Mizque working with three subsistence farming communities to protect a breeding cliff with 11-13 active nests (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012). An ecotourism lodge was inaugurated here in 2006 with proceeds going to the local communities, and it is planned to establish a protected area at this site (S. K. Herzog in litt. 2007). There are significant numbers of the species at the Santa Cruz Zoo in Bolivia and at zoos and in private holdings outside Bolivia (J. D. Gilardi in litt. 2012), but no formal management plan for these birds.Conservation Actions ProposedContinue surveying and monitoring (Clarke and Duran Pati√±o 1991, Snyder et al. 2000). Fence key patches of gallery forest to limit cattle-grazing and permit vegetation to regenerate (Snyder et al. 2000). Effectively enforce trade laws (Herrera and Hennessey 2007). Organise awareness campaigns (Clarke and Duran Pati√±o 1991). Identify suitable sites for protected areas throughout the species's range (Kyle 2005, A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012). Establish education programs to reduce nest-poaching and trapping. Assess the costs of compensating crop damage to avoid persecution of macaws in agricultural areas, and investigate alternatives to resolve the conflict between agriculture and macaw conservation as the main threat for the species (A. Rojas, F. Hiraldo and J. L. Tella in litt. 2012). Create a management plan for captive birds in ex-situ conservation, involving Bolivia and foreign countries, and incorporate pets and illegally traded birds into this programme (J. D. Gilardi, A.

Ongoing deforestation is suspected to be driving a population decline outside adequately protected areas. ","This species appears to be restricted to primary and secondary oak-dominated montane forest at 2,500-3,300 m (Barrera et al. 2010,  Carant√≥n 2010) on the less humid east-facing or sheltered valleys of the Western Andes (Barrera et al. 2010). It has been suggested that the species could range lower in elevation, below 2,500 m (Barrera et al. 2010,  Carant√≥n 2010); however, the majority of humid montane forest below that elevation on the eastern slope of the Western Andes has been cleared (Barrera et al. 2010). It inhabits the forest understorey and its territories are largely restricted to Chusquea bamboo thickets (Barrera et al. 2010). The stomach contents of specimens contained insects, mostly beetle (Coleoptera) remains, but they have been observed to take worms (Annelida) both in natural situations and at a feeding station (Barrera et al. 2010,  Carant√≥n 2010, Fundaci√≥n ProAves in press). Breeding is probably concentrated during the first half of the year (Carant√≥n 2010). ","The species has lost 19.5% of its original habitat however forest cover was stable between 2000 and 2010 (Renjifo et al. 2014). The species's habitat is threatened by on-going moderate levels of deforestation for pasture and cultivation, and is potentially threatened by mineral extraction (Barrera et al. 2010,  Carant√≥n 2010), which has so far been limited by local political instability (Carant√≥n 2010), but has seen a recent increase in interest as public order has improved  (Barrera et al. 2010). The threat of forest conversion is exacerbated by the largely private ownership of land in the P√°ramo de Sol massif and the low level of habitat protection in the region  (Barrera et al. 2010). Forests in the region are also affected by timber extraction and hunting (Carant√≥n 2010). In 2010 a fire caused by tourists burned approximately 110 ha of p√°ramo habitat (Carant√≥n 2014).","The known population numbers only 24 territories; however, an extrapolation of habitat preferences across the reserve and adjacent suitable areas, based on contour maps of the eastern and south-eastern slopes of the P√°ramo del Sol massif, gives an estimated known range size of potentially only 5.8 km2 and thus a cautious estimate of 57-156 territories. Each territory refers to a singing adult male, so this figure does not necessarily translate to an estimate of the number of pairs, and hence there are estimated to be fewer than 250 mature individuals, with the population placed in the band 50-249 mature individuals. This equates to 75-374 individuals in total, rounded here to 70-400 individuals.",Decreasing,"Grallaria fenwickorum was recently described from the P√°ramo de Frontino massif in the Western Andes of Colombia (Barrera et al. 2010, Carant√≥n 2010).

The known population numbers only 24 territories; however, an extrapolation of habitat preferences across the reserve and adjacent suitable habitat, based on contour maps of the eastern and south-eastern slopes of the P√°ramo del Sol massif, gives an estimated known range size of potentially as low as 5.8 km2 and thus a cautious estimate of between 57-156 territories (Barrera et al. 2010). Each territory refers to a singing adult male, so this figure does not necessarily translate to an estimate of the number of pairs (Barrera et al. 2010). The total range of G. fenwickorum is suspected to exceed that which is currently known (Barrera et al. 2010, Carant√≥n 2010); however, surveys in suitable areas have failed to locate the species (Barrera et al. 2010).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayConsidered Endangered at the national level in Colombia (Renjifo et al. 2014).

671,South America,Pterodroma phaeopygia,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PROCELLARIIFORMES,AVES,PROCELLARIIDAE,Pterodroma,phaeopygia,A2bce,This species has undergone extremely rapid declines in the past three generations (60 years) and is therefore classified as Critically Endangered.  ,"It breeds in the humid highlands at 300-900 m, in burrows or natural cavities, on slopes, in craters, sinkholes, lava tunnels and gullies usually in close proximity to Miconia plants (Baker 1980, Cruz and Cruz 1987, 1996). It feeds mostly on squid, fish and crustaceans (Castro and Phillips 1996). On San Crist√≥bal, nests were primarily located along ravines in areas of dense Miconia robinsoniana and native fern cover, with the majority of egg-laying taking place between May and October, peaking in August (Cruz-Delgado et al. 2010a). ","Like many species on the Gal√°pagos, the Galapagos Petrel is threatened by a number of invasive species. Brown and house rats represent a significant threat, with predation by rats found to be the primary cause of nest failure (72%) in a study of colonies on San Crist√≥bal in 2002-2003 (Cruz-Delgado et al. 2010). Cats and pigs have been eradicated from Baltra and Santiago respectively, although are still thought to represent a significant threat to the Galapagos Petrel on other islands through predation of eggs, young and adults. Goats, donkeys, dogs and other introduced mammals still exist in some areas of the petrel‚Äôs range but are thought to represent a much less significant threat. Depredation also occurs from native species, primarily the the Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus and the Galapagos Hawk Buteo galapagoensis, however, there is no clear reason to suspect this is occurring at levels high enough to drive declines. El Ni√±o events seem to have a detrimental impact on nesting and productivity. This species is potentially susceptible to changes in sea temperature, such as due to ENSO events and climate change, which may affect food supplies (D. Wiedenfeld in litt. 2012, BirdLife International unpubl. data). Some areas of breeding habitat have been lost to the invasive Blackberry plant, and less so to the Cinchona. Although habitat has previously been threatened by farming activity, the majority of breeding sites are now within Areas of Conservation within the zoning system of protected areas within the G√°lapagos National Park, with most colonies fenced or livestock removed from the area.","The global population estimate is best placed in the range of 10,000-19,999 individuals, based on an estimate of 4,500-5,000 active nests (representing 9,000-10,000 mature individuals) in 2008 (I. Guzm√°n in litt. 2008).",Decreasing,"Pterodroma phaeopygia is endemic to the Gal√°pagos Islands, Ecuador, breeding on Santa Cruz, Floreana, Santiago, San Crist√≥bal, Isabela and possibly other islands in the archipelago (Cruz and Cruz 1987, H. Vargas and F. Cruz in litt. 2000). Between 1978 and 1980, populations on the islands were estimated at 9,000 pairs on Santa Cruz (Baker 1980), c.11,250 on Santiago, and c.6,750 on Floreana and San Crist√≥bal (Tomkins 1985). By 1985, the Santa Cruz population had plummeted to 1,000 pairs, that on Santiago to less than 500 pairs (Cruz and Cruz 1987), and numbers on Floreana and presumably San Crist√≥bal were estimated to have declined to c.2,000 pairs (Coulter et al. 1981). An extensive survey of Santa Cruz in 2005 located c.300 previously unknown nests, but the island population totalled just 700 pairs (Valarezo 2006); a further survey in 2010 calculated 1,135 pairs (Valarezo and Heitmann 2011). Estimates in 2008 suggested a total of 4,500-5,000 active nests on all five islands (I. Guzm√°n in litt. 2008). Birds forage around the islands, but also disperse east and north towards South America and up to 2,000 km south (Spear et al. 1995). The species has recently been recorded off the coast of Peru, and records in Baja California could be this species or Pterodroma sandwichensis (Carboneras et al. 2015).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I. In 1982, predator control commenced in the Cerro Pajas colony (c.2,000 pairs) on Floreana (Cruz and Cruz 1996). Predator control involving intensive rat baiting around known colonies and petrel monitoring currently continues on Floreana, Santa Cruz, San Crist√≥bal and Santiago (H. Vargas and F. Cruz in litt. 2000, D. Wiedenfeld in litt. 2012). In early 2009, it was confirmed that goats have been successfully eradicated from Santiago (American Bird Conservancy 2009). A small number of burrows have recently been discovered on Alcedo, Isabela (Cruz-Delgado 2005). The islands are a national park and were declared a World Heritage Site in 1979. World Heritage Site designation encourages Ecuador to work carefully to enact suitable conservation laws and implement existing laws to protect the unique fauna and flora of the Gal√°pagos Islands. There are proposals to protect more marine key biodiversity areas within the Gal√°pagos Marine Reserve by amending the existing marine zoning scheme to reduce the impact from fishing (Edgar et al. 2008). The wind turbine development includes a series of mitigation and enhancement measures that will be instituted during implementation, many focusing on the Galapagos Petrel, and it is intended that these measures will not only act to minimise impacts but may actually help increase the population. A long-term monitoring programme is included as part of the project activity and ongoing operations (Anon. 2008). Exotic vegetation is being controlled with the help of local landowners on Santa Cruz (Valarezo and Heitmann 2011).Conservation Actions ProposedMonitor breeding success under various predator control regimes to determine most appropriate management (M. de L. Brooke in litt. 1999). Continue rat control programs on San Crist√≥bal, Santa Cruz, Floreana, and Santiago islands (D. Wiedenfeld in litt. 2012). On San Crist√≥bal, remove invasive plants such as blackberry and guava and reforest with native plants, particularly Miconia robinsoniana (Cruz-Delgado et al. 2010a, D. Wiedenfeld in litt. 2012); on Floreana, continue to control Lantana;&#160;and on Santa Cruz, control Cinchona pubescens and blackberries (D. Wiedenfeld in litt. 2012). Continue searching for nesting grounds in agricultural areas which are not protected through the park system on Santa Cruz and Isabela (B. Hennessey in litt. 2008). Conduct a full census for the species as the last comprehensive surveys were in the 1980s and late 1990s (not complete). Ensure wind-power plants are situated so that they do not affect nesting areas or sites with Miconia, and that power lines are buried to prevent aerial collisions as the birds return to their colonies at night. Implement a post-construction monitoring programme on San Crist√≥bal to assess long-term effects of the turbines (Cruz-Delgado et al. 2010b). Determine potential effects of long-line fishing in the Gal√°pagos Marine Reserve and elsewhere in the eastern Pacific and assess how to avoid them. Working with landowners in areas outside the park, create conservation easements to protect petrel nesting habitat. Create an education programme in the agricultural areas to motivate and educate landowners in habitat conservation (Valarezo 2012, B. Hennessey in litt. 2008). Create a species action plan involving local stakeholders (B. Hennessey in litt. 2008). Conduct rodent control campaigns around colonies on San Crist√≥bal.

672,South America,Phoebastria irrorata,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PROCELLARIIFORMES,AVES,DIOMEDEIDAE,Phoebastria,irrorata,B2ab(v),"This species is classified as Critically Endangered because it has an extremely small breeding range, essentially confined to one island, and evidence suggests that it has experienced a substantial recent population decline linked to bycatch mortality in artisanal fisheries in its principal foraging grounds. ","Behaviour This species breeds annually, arriving at colonies in late March (with males arriving earlier than females and older birds earlier than younger birds) (Harris 1973, Huyvaert et al. 2006, Jahncke 2007), and laying from mid-April to late June. Chicks fledge between late December and early January. Some pairs skip breeding in certain years (Jahncke 2007, Street 2013). The age of first breeding is at four to six years of age or more, but individuals return to colonies, typically late in the season, from two years of age (Hirschfeld 2008, ACAP 2009, Street 2013).&#160;Habitat Breeding Nesting takes place on sparsely vegetated areas with lava surrounded by boulders (Harris 1973) but also, more recently, in thick scrub vegetation (Anderson et al. 2002).&#160;Diet It feeds on squid, fish, and crustaceans (Harris 1973), but scavenging food items disgorged by other species (such as cetaceans and boobies) may be an important feeding strategy (Merlen 1996, Anderson and Cruz 1998). A tracking study showed that during the breeding season, those birds that breed on&#160;Espa√±ola&#160;made foraging trips eastwards towards the continental shelf and along the coast of Peru (Awkerman et al. 2014). The small number of birds from La Plata Island made much shorter but more frequent foraging trips to the continental shelf (Awkerman et al. 2014).","Altered temperature regimes associated with climate change poses a major threat. The species has shown susceptibility to past El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, in the form of increased adult mortality and increased negative interactions with fisheries under these conditions (Rechten 1986, Awkerman et al. 2006). The species also suffers from both incidental and targeted capture by the fishery (ACAP 2009). In small-scale Ecuadorian and Peruvian fisheries, Waved Albatross was the most frequent bycatch, caught in demersal and surface longlines and shark driftnets (Mangel 2012). The estimated bycatch rate of 0.11 birds per 1,000 hooks is sufficient to drive significant declines. Males seem more likely to be killed in longline operations, resulting in a female-skewed sex ratio (1.188 females per male; Awkerman et al. 2007) and indicating that bycatch is likely to be a significant source of adult mortality (Street 2013) and reduced effective population size. Avian pox was recorded in chicks on Espa√±ola, which subsequently displayed higher mortality than unaffected chicks, although the outbreak was small and population impacts at present unlikely to be significant (Tompkins et al. 2017). Introduced mosquitoes produces distress in birds and is the proposed cause for the observed movement of eggs by parents (frequently resulting in the loss of the egg) and mass abandonment of eggs (Harris 1969, Anderson and Fortner 1988). This threat may be exacerbated by climate change, as increased abundance of mosquitoes Aedes taeniorhynchus have been recorded during warm ENSO years with heavy rainfall. Oil spills have impacted the population in the past and may be a returning threat (Anderson et al. 2003).","On Espa√±ola, the breeding population was estimated at c. 12,000 pairs in 1970-1971, 15,600-18,200 pairs in 1994 and at least 34,694 adults in 2001. On La Plata Island, there are probably fewer than 10-20 pairs.",Decreasing,"Phoebastria irrorata is endemic to&#160;Ecuador. It breeds primarily along the southern coast of Espa√±ola Island in the Gal√°pagos Islands, and, perhaps, a few pairs breed on La Plata Island off of Manab√≠ province, Ecuador (Harris 1973). Breeding adults travel to the Peruvian upwelling region to feed (Anderson and Cruz 1998, H. Vargas and F. Cruz in litt. 2000, Awkerman et al. 2014), and in the non-breeding season birds move mainly east and south-east into the waters of the Ecuadorian and Peruvian continental shelf to the extreme north of Chile (Tickell 1996, Anderson and Cruz 1998, BirdLife International 2004, K. Huyvaert pers. comm. 2016). Rarely seen north of the equator, they are occasionally sighted off the coasts of Colombia (at least from El Choco) and Panama (Granizo 2002, Jahncke 2007).&#160;On Espa√±ola, the overall breeding population was considered to have been stable during the 20th Century. It was estimated at c.12,000 pairs in 1970-1971 (Harris 1973), 15,600-18,200 pairs in 1994 (Croxall and Gales 1998, Douglas 1998), and at least 34,694 adults in 2001 (Anderson et al. 2002). Although there has not been a global population estimate since 2001, surveys at two principal breeding sites on Espa√±ola in 2007 demonstrated a decrease in the number of breeding birds since 2001, and an overall population decrease (including non-breeders) at these sites since 1994 (Anderson et al. 2008). The breeding distribution has changed owing in part to vegetation regrowth following the eradication of goats (Anderson et al. 2002). Breeding no longer occurs at two inland sites, perhaps through redistribution to the coast (Anderson and Cruz 1998, Douglas 1998). On La Plata Island, there are probably fewer than 10-20 pairs (Anderson and Cruz 1998), and long-term data are too limited to assess population trends (Croxall and Gales 1998). In 2001, three adults were seen there with no evidence of breeding and a further 11 non-breeding adults were found on Isla Genovesa (Anderson et al. 2002).&#160;Recent evidence has shown a 2-3% reduction in annual adult survival compared with that in the 1960s, which is thought to have driven recent dramatic declines in the breeding population (Awkerman et al. 2006, J. Croxall in litt. 2006, Anderson et al. 2008). Analysis of birds caught as intentional and incidental take in inshore fisheries has revealed that a disproportionate number of males are taken, which will result in further decreases to the effective population size given that this species has obligate bi-parental care (Awkerman et al. 2006). Even if immediate action was taken to curb adult mortality the population will continue to decline for a decade or so until the current cohort of juveniles reach breeding age (J. Croxall in litt. 2006). Breeding sites may be constrained by the extent and location of take-off points, which are in turn limited by dense vegetation (Gibbs and Woltz 2010).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions Underway Espa√±ola is part of the Gal√°pagos National Park and Marine Reserve. Industrial, but not artisanal, longlining is prohibited in the Gal√°pagos Marine Reserve (Anderson et al. 2003). In 1979, the islands were declared a World Heritage Site. Espa√±ola is well protected and has no alien fauna (goats having been eradicated in 1978; Anderson and Cruz 1998, Jim√©nez-Uzc√°tegui et al. 2007), and tourism is well-regulated (Carboneras 1992). A tortoise breeding programme has led to the release of over 2,000 tortoises on the island in the last 30 years; as the only native herbivore these animals may play a key role in vegetation control and maintaining suitable habitat for breeding albatrosses (Jahncke 2007). La Plata Island is part of Machalilla National Park, but is insufficiently protected (Carboneras 1992). The Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) organised workshops in Peru and Ecuador in 2007 and 2008 to develop an Action Plan for Waved Albatross. There are proposals to protect more marine key biodiversity areas within the Gal√°pagos Marine Reserve by amending the existing marine zoning scheme to reduce the impact from fishing (Edgar et al. 2008).The Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF), Galapagos National Park Directorate (GNPD) and collaborators are carrying out long-term monitoring and on-going research using mark-recapture studies to determine changes in survival and reproduction, and investigating the relative importance of potential threats (heavy metals, diseases, climate change and human interaction). Conservation Actions ProposedEnumerate the breeding population regularly and establish a baseline to ascertain trends.

Modelled population declines are a consequence of very low adult survival owing to incidental mortality in longline fisheries, compounded by low fledging success caused by predation of chicks by introduced mice.  ","Behaviour It is a colonial, biennially breeding species. Adults return in November and December, lay in January and the chicks fledge in November. Immature birds begin returning to their breeding colony at 3-7 years after fledging. The vast majority of D. dabbenena recruit in their natal colony, at a mean age of 10 years (range 4-20 years) (ACAP 2009). The oldest recorded bird was at least 38 years old (Ryan 2009). It catches prey by surface-seizing, and the prevalence of a bioluminescent group of cephalopods in one dietary study suggests that D. dabbenena often feed at night (ACAP 2009). During the breeding season the length and range of foraging trips varies considerably, depending on the stage of the breeding cycle (BirdLife International 2004, Cuthbert et al. 2005). Habitat Breeding It nests at 400-700 m (rarely to 300 m) (Ryan and Glass 2001, Davies et al. 2015), primarily in wet heath where it is open enough for take-off and landings. Diet It feeds on cephalopods and fish (J. Cooper in litt. 1999), and probably follows ships and trawlers for offal and galley refuse."," Interaction with longline fisheries represents a major threat, with a high proportion of bycatch in southern Brazilian water being of this species (Neves et al. 2000, Olmos et al. 2000), including birds banded at Gough (Croxall and Gales 1998, J. Cooper in litt. 1999). It has been estimated that c. 500 individuals of this species are killed every year by longliners (Goren and Ryan 2010). Satellite tracking of breeding birds indicates considerable overlap between bird distribution and areas of longline fishing (Cuthbert et al. 2005). A study of great albatross bycatch from Uruguayan and Japanese longline fisheries in the south-west Atlantic off Uruguay found most Tristan Albatross bycatch occurred between September and November in pelagic waters where many other fleets operate (Jim√©nez et al. 2014). On-land threats include predation by introduced species. On Inaccessible Island, population decline was probably due to predation by rats, feral pigs (now absent) and humans (Fraser et al. 1988, Ryan et al. 1990). The failure to recover is unclear, but may be because young birds become entangled in thick vegetation (Ryan et al. 1990, P. G. Ryan in litt. 1999), or there is a high mortality in long-line fisheries. On Tristan, its extirpation was probably the result of human exploitation (Hagen 1952), although predation by rats (and possibly mice) may have been a factor (Fraser et al. 1988). At present, the greatest risk is posed by house mice Mus musculus, which causes very low breeding success on Gough and alone is sufficient to drive a population decline of over 50% over three generations (Cuthbert et al. 2003, Cuthbert and Hilton 2004, Wanless et al. 2007, Davies et al. 2015). Mouse attacks on chicks peaked in May-June at the start of the austral winter and all predation took place at night, normally 1-2 mice were recorded attacking the chick, with death occurring 3.9 ¬±1.2 days after the first attack (Davies et al. 2015). An additional threat on Gough is peat slips caused by storms burying and killing nestlings and adults, although this is probably a very rare event (Ryan 1993).","Breeding populations are essentially restricted to Gough Island, with 2-3 pairs nesting intermittently on Inaccessible Island (McClelland et al. 2016). The annual breeding population is currently estimated to be 1,250-1,750 pairs annually (RSPB and UCT unpubl. data), equivalent to a total population of 5200-7300 individuals for this biennially breeding species (RSPB and UCT unpubl. data). This roughly equates to 3,400-4,800 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Diomedea dabbenena breeding populations are essentially restricted to Gough Island, Tristan da Cunha, St Helena (to UK), having become extinct on Tristan (although birds were seen prospecting in 1999; Ryan et al. 2001), and 2-3 pairs breed annually on Inaccessible Island (McClelland et al. 2016). Using consecutive annual accounts of incubating adults and a population model the population has been estimated at c. 1,700 breeding pairs, giving a total global population of 7,100 individuals (ACAP 2010). Recent counts suggest that the population on Gough has decreased by 28% over 46 years, and at 3% annually between 2000 and 2011 (Cuthbert et al. 2014), and by nearly 50% between 2001-2016 (0-8% decline per year; RSPB and UCT unpubl. data) in line with population modelling predictions of annual decline rates of 2.9-5.3% (Ryan et al. 2001, Wanless et al. 2009), equivalent to declines of &gt;96% in three generations. Predation of chicks by mice has led to very low breeding success; between 2000 and 2015 this averaged only 27%, less than half that of other studied Diomedea colonies (Cuthbert et al. 2003, Cuthbert and Hilton 2004, Wanless et al. 2007, Cuthbert et al. 2014, Davies et al. 2015). Breeding success in 2014 was just 9.6%, the lowest recorded since counts started in 2001 (Davies et al. 2015). Outside the breeding season, it disperses to the western South Atlantic in summer, moves eastwards to South African waters and, northwards along the African Atlantic coast as far as southern Angola&#160; (Reid et al. 2013). Up to 15% migrate across the Indian Ocean to southern Australian waters (Reid et al. 2013).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions Underway ACAP Annex 1. On Tristan, a programme to eradicate cats was successful in the 1970s. Gough and Inaccessible are nature reserves and a World Heritage Site. Both islands are uninhabited, apart from a meteorological station on Gough (Tristan da Cunha Government and RSPB 2016). Satellite tracking to determine foraging areas during the breeding season was undertaken in 2000-2001 (Cuthbert et al. 2003). Censuses of large chicks and/or incubating adults were carried out during 1999-2016, and a monitoring protocol was devised (Cuthbert and Sommer 2004). Satellite tracking of non-breeders, further monitoring and demographic work, and an investigation of mouse predation on chicks was initiated in 2003. It is technically feasible to eradicate mice from Gough Island (Parkes 2008, Cuthbert et al. 2011a, b, RSPB unpubl. data). In September 2013 a trial drop of non-toxic bait over the vegetated cliffs of Gough showed that around 80% of the bait was retained on the cliffs and would be accessible to mice living there (Cuthbert et al. 2011a). Since 2007, birds have been marked with field-readable plastic leg rings, and by 2016, &gt;1,000 individuals had been ringed (RSPB and UCT unpubl. data).  Conservation Actions Proposed Eradicate mice on Gough Island as soon as possible. Annually survey numbers and assess breeding success on Gough. Continue research of at-sea distribution and foraging behaviour, particularly of non-breeding birds. Promote adoption of best-practice mitigation measures in all fisheries within the species' range, particularly via intergovernmental mechanisms such as ACAP, FAO and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations.&#160;",Afrotropical|Neotropical,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Further conservation actions are required as a matter of urgency if this species is to survive.  ","It forages in pairs and small mixed-species flocks in the middle strata of upland semi-humid forest at 500-790 m (Roda et al. 2011). Birds range from 1.5 to 9 m above ground, keeping mostly at 5-8 m (Whitney and Pacheco 1997). Foraging flocks reportedly include White-flanked Antwren M. axillaris and a variety of other formicariids, although observers at Mata do Estado failed to locate it in mixed flocks (Roda et al. 2003). The diet consists of arthropods, including spiders, beetles, ants and cockroaches. Breeding probably occurs in February, and juveniles have been recorded in May. ","Forest at Murici has been reduced from 70 km2 in the 1970s to 30 km2 of highly disturbed and fragmented habitat in 1999 (J. M. Goerck in litt. 1999, 2000), largely as a result of logging and conversion to sugarcane plantations and pastureland. The site continues to be threatened by fires spreading from adjacent plantations, hunting, timber extraction and agriculture (J. M. Goerck in litt. 1999, A. Whittaker in litt. 1999, J. M. Goerck in litt. 2000, SAVE Brasil 2016). The Frei Caneca private reserve and BirdLife/SAVE Brasil area are also still suffering from illegal charcoal exploitation (P. Develey in litt. 2007). The massive clearance of Atlantic forest in Alagoas and Pernambuco has left few other sites likely to support populations of this species. Having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is also potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International unpubl. data). ",It is thought that fewer than 30 individuals persist (Pereira et al. 2014). It is therefore placed in the band 1-49 mature individuals.,Decreasing,"Myrmotherula&#160;snowi has only been recorded in Alagoas and Pernambuco states, north-east Brazil. It was first discovered at Murici (Alagoas) in 1979, when an adult male and two adult females were collected (Teixeira and Gonzaga 1985). An additional juvenile male was collected in 1984, and subsequent records throughout the 1990s, in 2000 and in 2009 have only found the species in very small numbers (Whitney and Pacheco 1995, 1997, J. M. Goerck in litt. 1999, A. Whittaker in litt. 1999, J. M. Goerck in litt. 2000, F. Olmos in litt. 2002).

Since 2007 the species has not been recorded outside Murici, despite all other known sites having been revisited, and it is not known whether the species persists outside Murici (B. Phalan in litt.&#160;2018). Despite extensive playback searches, no new sites for this species have been found (Pereira et al. 2014). Remaining habitat is very limited and severely fragmented.",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayConsidered Critically Endangered at the national level in Brazil (Instituto Chico Mendes de Conserva√ß√£o da Biodiversidade 2018). The efforts of conservationists resulted in the creation of the Murici Ecological Station in 2001, encompassing 6,116 ha. National and international efforts to ensure the effectiveness of this designation are on-going (J. M. Goerck in litt. 1999, 2000). Frei Caneca is a private reserve protecting c. 6 km2 of forest (Mazar Barnett et al.&#160;2005); an additional 360 ha of adjacent forest have been purchased by Birdlife/SAVE Brazil (P. Develey in litt. 2007). Research is ongoing into the species's population size, distribution, demographics, threats and ecology (SAVE Brasil 2016). A species action plan was formulated in 2016 (SAVE Brasil 2016). Actions in the plan include: installation of feeder in Murici, control of nest predators, population monitoring, location of further populations and development of a translocation programme (SAVE Brasil 2016).Conservation Actions ProposedMonitor the population at Murici and conduct surveys to confirm the species's status at other sites where it has been recorded. Survey other remnant patches of upland Atlantic forest in Alagoas, Pernambuco and&#160;Para√≠ba to search for further populations. Ensure the de facto protection and management of Murici Ecological Station. Secure the long-term protected status and conservation of Mata do Estado.

677,South America,Mergus octosetaceus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,ANSERIFORMES,AVES,ANATIDAE,Mergus,octosetaceus,C2a(i),"Recent records from Brazil indicate that this species's status may be marginally better than previously thought. Nevertheless, the remaining known population is still extremely small and fragmented, and the perturbation, damming and pollution of rivers are likely to be causing continuing declines. For these reasons, it is listed as Critically Endangered. Further information on the population size (in particular whether it exceeds 250 mature individuals) and on the subpopulation structure may result in its downlisting to Endangered in the future. ","It inhabits shallow, fast-flowing rivers, requiring rapids and clear waters. It occurs especially in the upper tributaries of watersheds, but ranges into small rivers with patches of gallery forest surrounded by 'cerrado' (tropical savanna) or within Atlantic Forest. It is non-migratory and does not abandon the stretch of river where it establishes its territory (Lamas 2006). Pairs have used 8-14 km stretches of river  (Bartmann 1996, L. F. Silveira in litt. 1999), nesting in tree-cavities and rock-crevices (C. Yamashita in litt. 2000, Lamas and Santos 2004, Bruno et al. 2010, Barbosa 2018) as well as riverbank holes (Carboneras et al. 2016). Breeding activity has been recorded between June and August (Lamas and Santos 2004, Bruno et al. 2006,&#160;2010), but timing may vary geographically. Incubation may last c.33 days (Bruno et al. 2010). Young birds have been observed between August and November (Lamas and Santos 2004, Bruno et al. 2006). The diet comprises fish, small eels, insect larvae, dobson flies (Corydalis spp.) and snails. In Serra da Canastra it eats mainly lambari Astyanax fasciatus. Territory size is believed to be related to the number of rapids, edgewaters, water speed, fish abundance and conservation of riparian vegetation (Lamas 2006). Its dispersal ability is unknown, but one young male banded in September 2010 was found breeding on another river 20 km away in June 2011 (Ribeiro et al. 2011).","Perturbation and pollution of rivers results largely from deforestation, agricultural expansion and, in the Serra da Canastra area, diamond-mining (Bartmann 1994, 1996; M. Diniz in litt. 2013). Previously, the species was thought to rely on gallery forest which, although protected by law in Brazil, has been cleared illegally throughout much of the species's range. However, evidence suggests it will occur on unforested, undisturbed stretches of river through 'cerrado'. All recent records of the species in the Serra da Canastra region refer to unprotected sites north of the National Park. These are sites under increasing pressure from mining, development of hydropower infrastructure and agriculture (L. V. Lins in litt. 2013). Mining has ceased in the immediate area of its known range, but there is no additional habitat for dispersing birds (L. F. Silveira in litt. 1999), and it is thought that diamond mining will resume at Serra da Canastra in the near future (L. V. Lins in litt. 2012). Expanding agriculture and the construction of hydroelectric dams are considered the principal threats to the species (Braz et al. 2003). Dam-building has already caused severe declines across much of its range, and is increasing in scale (L. V. Lins in litt. 2012). Tourist activities result in river perturbation and have been recorded within known territories and inside national parks (Ibama 2006).","The population was estimated at 250 individuals in 1992, and was thought likely to have declined since, given ongoing threats. However, there are recent suggestions that the population may exceed this figure (L.V. Lins in litt. 2012). Recent estimates from the three main areas currently known to hold the species are of 70-100 territories (140-200 mature individuals) in the Serra da Canastra area (L.V. Lins in litt. 2012, 2013), fewer than 50 individuals at Chapada dos Veadeiros (Disconzi 2012) and eight at Jalap√£o (IECOS Brasil 2013 per L.V. Lins in litt. 2013, Barbosa et al. 2015), but these figures require confirmation. The population is currently precautionarily maintained within the band 50-249 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The species occurs in extremely low numbers at a few highly disjunct localities in south-central Brazil, northeast Argentina and possibly Paraguay. The species's stronghold is in and (mostly) around Serra da Canastra National Park, Minas Gerais, Brazil (Lamas 2006, Lins et al. 2013), where recent surveys yielded a rough estimate of 70-100 territories, roughly equivalent to 140-200 mature individuals (L. V. Lins unpubl. data); if confirmed this would represent a significant increase to the size of the largest known subpopulation. Tributaries of the Rio S√£o Francisco in west Bah√≠a were thought to hold a significant population (Pineschi and Yamashita 1999), but a 2003 survey there failed to locate any birds. It has recently been found in Patroc√≠nio municipality, Minas Gerais (I. Lamas in litt. 2012); a record from Itacolomi State Park in the same state is though thought to refer to an accidental or escaped bird (Arvelino de Paula 2008, L. V. Lins in litt. 2012). In Goi√°s, there are records from Emas and Chapada dos Veadeiros national parks; the latter being surveyed in 2003-2004 with birds found just outside the park in the Rio das Pedras, and the total in the area thought to number fewer than 50 individuals (Disconzi 2012). In 1995, a small population was discovered on the Rio Tibagi, Paran√° (Anjos et al. 1997), but searches in 1998 were unsuccessful (L.F. Silveira in litt. 1999). In 2002, another small population was discovered on the Rio Novo, in Jalap√£o State Park, Tocantins (Braz et al. 2003), and six expeditions in 2007 and 2008 surveying a c.55 km stretch of the Rio Novo located three breeding pairs (Barbosa and Almeida 2010), and four pairs along 115 km of river in 2010-2011 (IECOS Brasil 2013 per L.V. Lins in litt. 2013, Barbosa et al. 2015). It is believed extinct in Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio de Janeiro (Pacheco and Fonseca 1999), S√£o Paulo, and Santa Catarina. In 2017, a male was photographed in&#160;Serra do Mar State Park, Sales√≥polis, S√£o Paulo, but this may have been a vagrant individual (Neto et al.&#160;2018). In Misiones, Argentina, 12 individuals were found on the Arroyo Uruz√∫ in 2002, the first records in the country for 10 years despite extensive surveys (Benstead 1994, Hearn 1994, J. C. Chebez in litt. 1999). In Paraguay, it was last recorded in 1984 and there is little (if any) habitat left. However, local reports indicate that a few individuals may still survive (R.P. Clay in litt. 2003).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is legally protected in all three range states.

For the last 50 years, the Colombian civil war has paradoxically effectively acted as a buffer protecting the localities where this species occurs. As peace between the Colombian government and the guerrillas takes hold, the population is increasingly exposed to illegal trafficking (Posso-Terranova and Andr√©s 2018) and the proposed land reforms are likely to result in a rapid increase in agriculture and extractive industries (Negret&#160;et al. 2017).","It was formerly a common species throughout its range.

Water-level regulation for a hydroelectric plant supplying nearby mines causes nesting and foraging areas to dry out, and breeding to fail. Mining activities also pollute the lake, with the north-western part rendered lifeless by iron-oxide sedimentation (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997, ECOAN 2009). The lake is also polluted by sewage from nearby towns, which causes eutrophication and oxygen depletion and may lead to a reduction in the amount of fish available for the grebe to feed on (Dinesen et al.&#160;2019).&#160;Relatively unstable climatic conditions, linked to El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation events, may have contributed to large population fluctuations, with a recovery in years with high water levels (e.g. 1997-1998)  (T. Valqui in litt. 1999), and previous poor breeding successes. Although the population has shown major fluctuations, its ability to recover were it to experience a series of poor years is in doubt. Many individuals died during extreme cold conditions in 1982; similar conditions in June 2007 gave cause for concern (G. Engblom in litt. 2007).","Different survey methods and identification challenges have made population estimates difficult. However, surveys between 2007 and 2016 indicate a population of between 217 and 468 individuals (ECOAN 2009, Engblom 2016a, b, Chamorro and Aucca 2017, Dinesen&#160;et al.&#160;2019), roughly equating to 145 - 312 mature individuals, rounded here to 140 - 320 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Podiceps taczanowskii is a flightless waterbird confined to Lake Jun√≠n in the highlands of Jun√≠n, west-central Peru. It was extremely abundant in 1938 (Morrison 1939), and the population was probably well over 1,000 birds in 1961 (O‚ÄôDonnel and Fjeldsa 1997), but has undergone a severe decline since then (Dinesen et al.&#160;2019). In the early and mid-1980s there were c. 250 birds, but only 100 were counted in 1992, falling to around 50 in 1993 (Valqui 1994). New extrapolations in early 1995, using a different methodology, estimated 205 individuals (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997). In August 1998, over 250 Podiceps sp. were found in 4 km2 of the lake (suggesting a total of 350-400 birds) and all those identified (over 20) were P. taczanowskii (T. Valqui in litt. 1999). Counts in 2001, 2002 and 2007 using standardised survey methods estimated the population at 304, 249 and 217 individuals respectively (ECOAN 2009). Censuses in August 2014 and 2015 counted 315 and 238 birds, respectively (A. Chamorro and R. Tito per Engblom 2016a, A. Chamorro per Engblom 2016b). In 2016, the population size was estimated at 468 individuals (Chamorro and Aucca 2017, Dinesen et al.&#160;2019).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayLake Jun√≠n has been declared a national reserve. Hunting and fishing are regulated but little has been done to interfere with the management of the water level, which is controlled by mining companies (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997). An attempt was made to translocate grebes to a lake north of Jun√≠n; capture and transfer were feasible, but the chosen lake (and others) was unsuitable because gill-nets are used to fish rainbow trout (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997). In 2002, the Peruvian government passed an emergency law to protect the lake which makes provisions for its cleaning and places greater restrictions on the extraction of water (Valqui 1994). In 2009 the species was adopted as a symbol of wetland conservation in the high Andes by groups including BirdLife International, American Bird Conservancy, ECOAN and INRENA, who have called for an independent environmental audit and continuous environmental monitoring of the lake (BirdLife International 2009). ECOAN has been undertaking conservation actions including a range of education and training activities with local communities, and research and monitoring of the species's population size and threats (ECOAN 2016).Conservation Actions ProposedMonitor the population and reproductive success (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997,&#160;T. Valqui in litt. 1999,&#160;Anon. 2007). Research the species's requirements throughout its life-cycle (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997). Protect clean watercourses flowing into Lake Junin and improve legislation and enforcement to prevent pollution (Dinesen et al.&#160;2019). Identify and reduce sources of pollution in dialogue with local stakeholders (Dinesen et al.&#160;2019). Reduce fluctuations in water-levels as a result of discharges from the hydropower dam&#160;(O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997, Dinesen et al.&#160;2019) with the agreement and participation of the local mining company (Anon. 2007). Identify a lake for potential translocation of individuals (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997) and consider establishing a captive-breeding population.

It appears from recent counts that the population is now stable, probably as a result of extensive conservation actions. If evidence continues to show that the population remains stable, the species may be downlisted to a lower category of threat in the future. ","During the breeding season, the species inhabits basaltic lakes in the arid Patagonian steppes at elevations of 500-1,200 m (Chebez 1994); saline and bitter-salt lakes are used by non-breeding flocks and at least some birds wintering on the Argentinian coast (Johnson and Serret 1994). Aquatic vegetation (mainly Myriophyllum elatinoides) on the breeding lakes is essential material for floating nests and as habitat for several aquatic invertebrates that form its basic diet (Chebez 1994). During the first week after hatching, chicks are fed with aquatic beetles (Limnaea spp.) (Chebez 1994). The species breeds in colonies of up to 130 pairs from October to March (Chebez 1994), but has an exceedingly low reproductive rate with an average of 0.2 young reared per adult per year (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997). However, while potential resources for breeding are apparently limited, the resources for adult survival appear to be plentiful, and under natural circumstances adult mortality may be extremely low (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997). It occasionally establishes colonies in areas marginal to its main range (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997). Individuals tend to have a high fidelity towards the plateaus where they were born (Roesler et al. 2016).","The principal threats to the species appear to be introduced American Mink Neovison vison,&#160;salmon and trout and climate change (S. Imberti in litt. 1999,&#160;Imberti and Casa√±as 2010,&#160;Casa√±as&#160;et al. 2013, Roesler et al. 2015).American Mink threaten the species at all stages of its life, with nests, chicks and adults all vulnerable to predation (Roesler&#160;et al. 2015, Fasola and Roesler 2018). In 2010-2011, an American Mink killed more than half the adults in a breeding colony of two dozen nests on the Buenos Aires plateau (Roesler&#160;et al. 2011a). Further losses to lone mink occurred in 2012-2013, with 15 adults and 7 juveniles killed at El Cervecero and 10 adults and 5 chicks killed at the very remote C199 colony in La Siberia plateau (Casa√±as&#160;et al.&#160;2013). Given that the Buenos Aires plateau currently holds a large proportion of the population, the presence of American Mink is a serious threat (Roesler&#160;et al. 2012). Furthermore, American Mink are known to exhibit 'surplus killing', which means that the presence of a single animal could result in the loss of whole grebe colonies (Roesler&#160;et al. 2015). Efforts to eradicate American Mink are complicated by its dispersal behaviour, with young males dispersing widely and re-occupying lakes (Fasola and Roesler 2018).Recently, the introduction of trout has been correlated with a decline in breeding numbers at certain lakes (S. Imberti&#160;in litt. 2006,&#160;Konter 2008). These exotic salmonids compete for food with the Hooded Grebe and modify lake conditions, increasing levels of cyanobacteria which may be harmful to grebes (Lancelotti&#160;et al.&#160;2015, Roesler&#160;et al. 2015, Izaguirre&#160;et al.&#160;2018, Francisco&#160;et al.&#160;2019).Surveys between 2006 and 2013 found a number of lakes completely dry, and water levels at known breeding sites were 2-3 m lower than in previous years&#160;(Konter 2008, Imberti and Casa√±as 2010, Roesler&#160;et al. 2011a, Casa√±as&#160;et al.&#160;2013). Anecdotal reports indicated reduced winter snowfall without a corresponding increase in precipitation at other times&#160;(Konter 2008). Research has indicated that lower water levels exacerbate the detrimental impact of introduced fish on the lake conditions and thus on the grebes (Izaguirre&#160;et al.&#160;2018). Given the small size of the population, the failure of an entire colony's breeding effort due to exceptionally high winds, as observed in 2013 at La Siberia, is another potentially serious threat (Casa√±as&#160;et al.&#160;2013). The apparent increase in the incidents of these exceptional winds over the last two decades (Roesler&#160;et al. 2015) may be related to overgrazing and/or climate change (Imberti and Casa√±as 2010).Excessive grazing by sheep (which causes erosion at lakeshores and limits the growth of emergent vegetation), predation by Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus at some lakes and attacks by Flying Steamerducks Tachyeres patachonicus&#160;(del Hoyo et al. 1992, O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997, Imberti and Casa√±as 2010, Roesler&#160;et al. 2015). The population may be limited by the carrying capacity of rather few lakes with good nest vegetation (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997). Volcanic eruptions in the breeding area may have a negative short-term effect because of heavy ash fall, but a long-term positive effect on the productivity of the wetlands (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997). There is oil exploitation on the potential migration route to the Atlantic&#160;(S. Imberti&#160;in litt.&#160;1999). Light pollution from cities, as well as oil exploitation and mining, may pose a threat on migration routes (Roesler et al. 2016b). Poor habitat conditions in breeding lakes may have increased competition for nest sites with other waterfowl species (Roesler&#160;et al. 2012, 2015). By-catch from fisheries may pose a threat in the winter range (Roesler et al. 2016b). The planned construction of two hydroelectric dams on the Santa Cruz River may cause changes to the species's wintering habitats and food availability, thereby threatening the species's wintering areas (Aves Argentinas 2016, Roesler et al. 2018a). Research has indicated that although the species winters at three estuaries, before returning to their breeding grounds they congregate at the Santa Cruz-Chico estuary, with almost 95% of the total population recorded there in August 2016 (Roesler et al.&#160;2018a), meaning that any impact of dams on this estuary could have a great impact on the population.","In 2013, a simultaneous count across all plateaus known to have ever held grebes and visiting virtually every lake with historic records of the species, resulted in a count of 691 adults and 144 chicks in 12 colonies (Casa√±as&#160;et al.&#160;2013). During the summer of 2014/2015, 771 adults, 138 juveniles and 12 colonies were recorded across 18 lakes (Roesler&#160;et al. 2015). Surveys during the breeding season in 2015/2016,&#160;&#160;2016/17&#160;and 2017/18&#160;counted 753, 749 and 776 adults, respectively (Roesler&#160;et al.&#160;2016b, 2017, 2018b). The total population is therefore estimated at 650-800 mature individuals.",Stable,"This species&#160;breeds on a few basaltic lakes in the interior of Santa Cruz, extreme south-west Argentina. The only known wintering grounds are located at the estuaries of r√≠o Coyle, r√≠o Gallegos and r√≠o Chico on the Atlantic coast of Santa Cruz (Johnson and Serret 1994, Imberti et al. 2004, Roesler et al. 2011b). It is apparently a summer visitor in the Torres del Paine National Park in Magallanes, southern&#160;Chile, but there are no confirmed breeding records for the country (Roesler et al. 2011b, S. Saiter and F. Schmitt in litt. 2013, Donoso et al. 2015, Roesler 2015). The total population was estimated at 3,000-5,000 individuals in the mid-1980s, with half of these on Meseta de Strobel (Fjelds√• 1984, O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997). Counts on the wintering grounds suggest a decline of 40% over a period of seven years (S. Imberti in litt. 2006). Surveys conducted in December 2006 and January 2009, which revisited key known breeding sites surveyed in 1987 (Lagunas del Sello, del Islote and Tolderia Grande) and 1998 (Encadenadas), also found sharp declines; numbers fell from 452 to 51 at Laguna del Sello, from 700 to 0 at Laguna del Islote, from 90 to 0 at Tolderia Grande (H. Casa√±as in litt. 2009) and from 198 to 0 at Lagunas Encadenadas (Konter 2008). While there is speculation that numbers fluctuate dramatically at breeding sites from year to year driven by movements rather than actual population fluctuations (Fjelds√• 1986), overall declines detected on the wintering and breeding grounds appear to have been real and rapid (Roesler&#160;et al. 2011b). In both the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 breeding seasons, the species was most abundant on three plateaus: Buenos Aires, Strobel and Siberia,&#160;with five lakes holding almost 85% of the population (Roesler&#160;et al. 2012). Comparing the total counts made across the same 58 lagoons in 1984-5 (2,352 individuals) and 2010-11 (471 individuals) suggests an overall population reduction of 80% over 26 years, most of which occurred in the Strobel plateau (Roesler et al. 2012, Roesler 2016). In 2013, greater resources allowed a simultaneous count across all plateaus known to have ever held grebes and visiting virtually every lake with historic records of the species, resulting in a count of 691 adults and 144 chicks in 12 colonies (Casa√±as&#160;et al.&#160;2013). During the summer of 2014/2015, 771 adults, 138 juveniles and 12 colonies were recorded across 18 lakes (Roesler&#160;et al. 2015). Three new lakes holding the species were identified; however, on the Strobel plateau the number of lakes holding the species decreased. Surveys during the breeding season in 2015/2016,&#160;&#160;2016/17&#160;and 2017/18&#160;counted 753, 749 and 776 adults, respectively&#160; (Roesler et al.&#160;2016b, 2017, 2018b).&#160;",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayAves Argentinas is Species Guardian for Hooded Grebe and, along with the local NGO Ambiente Sur, is coordinating the conservation effort. Patagonia National Park was created in 2014, covering 52,000 ha that includes over half of the breeding colonies&#160;(Roesler et al. 2015). The site where the species was discovered in 1974, Laguna Los Escarchados, was declared a reserve in 1979, but is now known to hold only a marginal population (O'Donnell and Fjelds√• 1997).&#160;Comprehensive surveys have taken place to locate all breeding colonies with ongoing monitoring to assess breeding success and mortality. Surveys of the breeding population have taken place annually since 2009 (Roesler et al.&#160;2018b). Surveys of wintering birds have been carried out along estuaries of the Atlantic coast (Roesler et al. 2015, 2018b). Research on the species's migration routes is underway, with the use of colour rings and GPS transmitters (Roesler&#160;et al. 2015, 2018b). Blood samples have been taken to perform genetic analyses and stable isotope analysis to better understand the species's diet.'Colony Guardians' have been established with local communities (Roesler et al. 2016a). These are local people assigned to protect nests from predators, and to collect breeding data. Their efforts have improved survival rates at a number of colonies; recruitment is significantly enhanced at nests with Colony Guardians (Roesler et al. 2016a). An awareness-raising program has included displays and theatre productions within the region and the production of a video highlighting the plight of the species, which has been presented to over 100,000 people. An interpretation centre has been established at R√≠o Gallegos, an important wintering area for the species (Roesler&#160;et al. 2015). Workshops have been held in 2014 and 2016 to provide updates on conservation work and engage with the scientific community (Roesler&#160;et al. 2015, Roesler&#160;et al.&#160;2016b). Members of the Hooded Grebe Project have met with fishing, environmental and conservation agencies in Santa Cruz to inform them of key sites for the species to support decision-making (Roesler&#160;et al. 2015). In August 2015, a 'Hooded grebe month' took place, involving&#160;educational, recreational, cultural and artistic activities (Roesler&#160;et al. 2016b). Teachers have been trained about the species's biology and threats (Roesler&#160;et al. 2016b).A monitoring protocol and control program for invasive species has been devised, targeting American Mink, Kelp Gulls (Stuart et al. 2013) and salmonid populations at breeding lakes and identifying routes of arrival. Work is ongoing to eradicate American Mink from the high plateau areas (Roesler et al. 2015, 2016b). In 2014/2015, 40% fewer mink were captured compared to 2013/2014 indicating that these control measures were proving to be effective. A regulation has been passed banning the introduction of trout on the Buenos Aires plateau and a large number of trout have been removed from Laguna El Islote (Casa√±as&#160;et al.&#160;2013, Roesler&#160;et al.&#160;2018a). In 2015, Kelp Gull were controlled on the Buenos Aires plateau by shaking eggs to reduce breeding success (Roesler&#160;et al.&#160;2016).&#160;&#160;A captive rearing programme has been initiated near the Strobel Lake population, with the aim of raising wild eggs in captivity and releasing them back to Strobel Lake in order to boost the population (Roesler&#160;et al. 2015), although by 2018 no captive-reared chicks had so far been released (Roesler&#160;et al. 2018a).Experiments to prevent the loss of colonies to wave action during exceptionally strong winds have been undertaken, but were halted due to the risk posed to the grebes (Casa√±as et al. 2013, Roesler et al.&#160;2018a).&#160;Conservation Actions ProposedContinue comprehensive surveys of breeding colonies and winter censuses of estuaries and unfrozen lakes. Expand the 'Colony Guardian' approach to all active colonies. Eradicate American Mink from the high plateau areas and control the size of Kelp Gull colonies at key sites (Roesler&#160;et al. 2015).&#160;Extend the area ban on introducing salmonids to further breeding locations and work with landowners to raise awareness of the impacts of introducing salmonids. Study the species's ecology to understand population movements. Continue to investigate the threats to the species and the reasons behind recent declines. Investigate the threats to Hooded Grebes on the wintering grounds, particularly their interaction with fisheries (Roesler et al. 2012).

The combined effects of grazing, invasive grasses, annual burning and conversion to agriculture for Eucalyptus plantations, soybeans and pastures for exportable crops, encouraged by government land reform (Stotz et al. 1996, Parker and Willis 1997), had heavily or moderately altered two-thirds of the cerrado region by 1993 (Conservation International 1999). Most of this destruction has occurred since 1950 (Cavalcanti 1999). The cerrado habitat may also be altered by climate change, which poses a further threat to the species (≈ûekercioƒülu et al. 2012).","The population is estimated to number c.110-260 individuals, based on an assessment of known records, descriptions of abundance and range size.&#160;This is consistent with recorded population density estimates for congeners or close relatives with a similar body size, and the fact that only a proportion of the estimated extent of occurrence is likely to be occupied.

","It was reported mostly along major rivers, but this may reflect travellers' dependence on river transport rather than the species's true habitat requirements. It appears to have been adapted to consume palm nuts as its staple, and therefore presumably wandered into palm-savannas and potentially lightly wooded areas. The only palm in its range with the appropriate size and type of nut is the Yatay (or Chatay) palm Butia yatay (Yamashita and Valle 1993). It nested and roosted on cliffs and the average clutch-size was probably two eggs (Collar et al. 2014). ","Settlement of the major river basins within its range was presumably accompanied by the widespread loss of palm-groves, either through direct clearance for agriculture or the suppression of regeneration by colonists' cattle. Yatay palm, which the species probably fed on, was targeted for clearance by early colonists as it is an indicator of good soil quality (Collar et al. 2014). Widespread loss of gallery forests could also have had an impact on the species (Collar et al. 2014). The size and appearance of the bird probably made it a significant target for hunters, and even the taking of young as pets could have been important. There is some evidence that it was traded, but little to support various claims that there has been recent trade in live specimens. Any current trade in eggs, skins or live specimens would obviously be extremely harmful.

687,South America,Cebus kaapori,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,PRIMATES,MAMMALIA,CEBIDAE,Cebus,kaapori,A2acd+3cd+4acd,This species is listed as Critically Endangered due to a drastic population reduction over the past three generations (48 years). During this period it is estimated that the population has been reduced by at least 80% due both to deforestation and to hunting for bushmeat. Lopes and Ferrari (1993) and Ferrari and Queiroz (1994) concluded that Cebus kaapori is one of the most threatened of all the Amazonian primates. More recently the species was considered one of the most threatened primate species in the world (Mittermeier et al. 2012). A further decline at the same rate is expected to affect this species over the next three generations.,"Cebus kaapori occurs in dense rain forest and deciduous forest environments of Eastern Amazonia. The taxon is not restricted to primary habitats, but it is not tolerant to changes/disturbance in its environment. Recent records from areas close to the coast at Par√° State suggest that C. kaapori also uses stretches of mangroves and estuarine floodplain (Silva Jr. et al. 2009, Silva Jr. et al. 2010). Groups observed by Carvalho Jr et al. (1999) ranged in size from 1 to 7 individuals. The species is described as essentially frugivorous, supplementing their diet with arthropods and seeds. In the only study that followed a group throughout the dry season, at the Tucuru√≠ hydroelectric scheme, Goian√©sia do Par√°, the animals used their time mostly ranging (47.4%), feeding (24%) and foraging (15.3%). Time spent resting was only 9%, which is very low for gracile capuchin monkeys, suggesting a dietary stress for this group (Oliveira et al. 2014).&#160; In the same study, 74% of feeding records were of fruit intake, 13% of insects and 10% of seeds (Oliveira et al. 2014). The capuchins showed a preference for seven plant species in the study site: Inga alba, Bellucia grossularioides, Attalea maripa, Alchorneopis floribunda, Gustavia augusta, Apeiba burchellii, and Bactris maraja (Oliveira et al. 2014).&#160; They also ate caterpillars, ants, snails, spiders, wasp nests, honeycombs, and also an unidentified rodent (Oliveira et al. 2014). This group used 62 ha, and traveled for an average of 2.1 km/day (Oliveira et al. 2014). They used open ombrophylic forest, as well as secondary vegetation, acai palm forest, and riparian forest (Oliveira et al. 2014). This study remains the only one to describe in detail the aspects of the natural history of the species (Oliveira 2011; Oliveira et al. 2014). Oliveira et al. (2014) found significant dietary overlap between C. kaapori and Sapajus (the robust capuchin), suggesting that sympatric competition with robust capuchins may exacerbate the risk of extinction for C. kaapori in the highly fragmented and anthropogenically disturbed habitats where both remain.Size: Paratype. Adult male HB 46.5 cm, TL 51.0 cm, 3.05 kg (Queiroz 1982).","The major threat for the species is habitat loss, as its forests in southern Par√° and Maranh√£o have been extensively destroyed over the last 30 years. It is the region with the highest human population density and the highest level of deforestation and habitat degradation in the entire Brazilian Amazon (Carvalho Jr. et al. 1999). The Gurup√≠ Biological Reserve is the only protected area where the species is known to occur, but the reserve has lost more than half of its forests. Lopes (1993) concluded that selective logging was particularly prejudicial to Cebus kaapori due to the loss of trees providing fruits that are a significant component of its diet. The species is also hunted in the area. Guaj√° indians also keep them as pets (Queiroz 1992).","Carvalho, Jr. et al. (1999) observed group sizes ranging from 2 to 7 individuals. Oliveira et al.

Lopes (1993) detected three groups in a 480 km survey inside the Gurup√≠ Biological Reserve. Twenty years afterwards, Buss et al. (2014) found 0.25 groups/10 km. Densities estimates for the species in Rebio Gurup√≠, Maranh√£o, were also recorded from 0.2 to 0.98 ind./km¬≤ (Ferrari and Lopes 1996, Lopes and Ferrari 1996).The remaining total population size is not known, and neither is it known if the number of mature individuals of this species is greater than 10,000.

In the last three generations this is inferred to have resulted in the loss of over half the population, and it is predicted to intensify in the next three generations to result in a decline rate exceeding 80% over the next 10 years due to habitat degradation/loss and the effects of introduced species.","European Mink have specialised habitat requirements. They are semi-aquatic, inhabiting densely vegetated banks of rivers, streams and sometimes, during warm seasons, they may inhabit lake-banks. It is rarely found more than 100 metres away from freshwater. There are no records of its presence at the sea coast.They hunt both in riparian zones and in the water for amphibians, crustaceans (crayfish), fish, small mammals, insects and birds (Sidorovich et al. 1998; Maran et al. 1998; Palaz√≥n et al. 2004, 2008). Females become mature for the next breeding season at 11 months (Maran unpublished).","The decline and extinction of the European Mink cannot be explained with a single universal factor. The main factors operating the extinction have been (1) habitat loss, (2) over-exploitation and (3) impact of alien American Mink.In the European continent, human activities have resulted in large-scale alteration of landscapes, which has had a substantial impact on various habitats and their species. The European Mink has proved to be sensitive to human-induced environmental change and disturbance. As the type and extent of human influence on the species and its biotope has varied over time and between regions in Europe, the set of factors contributing to the extinction has varied as well.Several factors have often been acting in concert with a cumulative effect. The course of decline during the first half of the 20th century in central regions of Russia is a perfect illustration to this. There, the effect of over-exploitation was noticed almost throughout the entire European Mink range (this even resulted in a moratorium of hunting in several regions and even in reinforcement efforts in Jaroslav Region, where around 130 European Mink were translocated with the hope to recover the original, depleted population). In addition, extensive change of habitats in the mid-20th century further contributed to the decline. Thereafter, the invasion of the American Mink posed a very serious threat to the native mink. Large-scale introduction of American Mink in Russia, first planned to be conducted only in regions outside the European Mink's natural range, were ultimately performed also inside the native mink range. The reason for this was twofold: (1) the original mink has become too scarce for the fur-trapping industry, (2) higher value of American Mink fur in the market (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). It is important to note that in these times the American Mink and European Mink were not regarded by the relevant authorities to be two distinct species. In the course of the introduction operation, 20,400 American Mink were released in the USSR until 1971, with around 4,000 of them being released into the range of the European Mink (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). The intentional introduction of the alien species was strongly supported by rapidly developing mink fur-farming in the former Soviet Union ‚Äì escapees from farms formed a continuous source of new founders for introduction. American Mink farming started in the 1920s; in 1972, 1.9 million female American Mink were kept in fur-farms and in 1973, 4.9 million mink were raised in 146 farms in the former Soviet Union (Abramov 1974). As the native mink populations were small and highly fragmented by over-exploitation and habitat loss, the fur-farm escapees, being ecologically more flexible (Maran 1991) easily invaded into the freely available ecological niche, thus making it impossible for the depleted European Mink to recover. Even more, the remaining European Mink groups were an easy target for intra-guild aggression (Maran et al. 1991, 1998; Sidorovich et al. 1999, 2001). The magnitude of the effect of mink farming on the native mink is well illustrated by a recent study in Denmark (a country with a very high number of mink farms), which concludes that 86% of free-living American Mink are escapees from farms (Hammershoj et al. 2005).Local key factors have changed with time also in many other countries. For instance the impact of over-hunting and/or habitat change weakened the populations and accelerated the impact of the subsequent spread of the American Mink and/or the impact of other factors. It might well be that sometimes the interchange of key factors in time and/or the concurrent impact of several factors has led to a synergistic effect on the European Mink. Further, the time from the introduction of the threat to the extinction of the species can be highly variable, resulting in the so-called extinction or decline lag (Baillie et al. 2004). This, along with the interwoven effect of numerous factors, is likely to result in situations when it is hard or, in some cases, even impossible to identify the actual causes behind the extinction process.The role of the alien American Mink deserves a special attention. Its role has been noted in several reports as a secondary or not at all important factor, usually emphasizing that the decline of the European Mink started before the invasion of American Mink (Lod√© 2002, Lod√© et al. 2001, Rozhnov 1992, Schubnikova 1982). Still, there are several records about local extinction of the European Mink concurrent with rapid expansion of the American Mink, e.g., in Estonia, Tver Region in Russia, Basque country (Zadorra river basin and northern Bizkaia) in Spain, Belarus (Cena et al. 2003; Katchanovsky 2002; Maran 1991; Palaz√≥n et al. 2002, 2004; Sidorovich 1991, 1993). Further, although there are ‚Äútime-shot‚Äù records on the co-existence of the two mink species, no records demonstrating long-term sympatric coexistence of the two mink species have been traced. Numerous records reveal the local replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink, but no opposite events have been reported. Records on replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink are further supported by studies of behavioural interactions between the two mink species in the wild and well as in experimental conditions. All this evidences that the American Mink has played a special role in the demise of the European Mink. While most of the other agents which have been operating the extinction are relatively easy to stop by conventional conservation management, there is very little one can do to prevent the spread of the alien American Mink. This means that the presence of the American Mink in wide territories across Europe makes the efforts for species recovery a very complicated task.In addition to the main factors behind the decline of European Mink populations, a number of other factors may pose a local threat to the remaining small populations, like hybridization, road casualties, Aleutian disease, secondary poisoning etc.Habitat loss and degradation is still a serious threat especially in the western population, both in France and in Spain (mostly in Cantabric rivers).","Its range has reduced by over 85% since the mid-19th century. The remaining population is small, fragmented and declining. The most viable population in Western Europe is in the Danube Delta. The current European Mink range in Russia consists of isolated distant habitat patches of different size. These fragmented populations are scattered across western Russia, the Urals, and the northern Caucasus. The only parts of the range where the American Mink is absent are rivers in the Archangelsk Region and Komi and probably also in Northern Caucasus. Everywhere else the populations of European Mink are vanishing or becoming increasingly fragmented and localized. The Russian population of European Mink has been estimated at ca. 20,000 (Tumanov 2003, 2006), but this is not based on quantitative data as no large-scale census has been done. Hunting bags suggest that the European Mink is rapidly becoming less abundant by comparison with the American Mink: for instance, in Vologda and Kostroma regions the proportion of European Mink skins in the hunting bag of the two mink species decreased from 50‚Äì70% to 1‚Äì10% within the last 5‚Äì7 years (to 2006). For the whole of Russia, recent records refer only to the capture of single individuals or to local populations consisting of some ten of individuals (Skumatov and Saveljev 2006). The number of 20,000 mink in Russia seems to be an extensive overestimate of present population size.Due to the intensive American Mink control measures during last decade the population in Spain (in Mediterranean basin) is quite stable. Still, remarkable fragmentation has been observed in its range in the north (Basque Country) and the population disappears because of the American Mink. At the same time, a slight expansion of the range to south and southeast has been observed in Aragon in the Ebro River basin (Gomez et al. in press).The overwhelming majority of remaining populations are in decline and of low density. Therefore the size of the species' range leads to overestimation of the population status. It is likely that the overall number of mink has declined more than 90% since the beginning of the 20th century. Also, the presence of the American Mink in most of range fragments confuses the reports and makes the status projections to the future rather pessimistic.Some national estimates of population abundance:Spain: 500‚Äì1,000 individuals (Palaz√≥n et al. 2003).France: several hundred (S. Aulagnier and R. Libois pers. comm. 2006).Danube Delta: since 2003 until 2010 a total of 70 European Mink were life captured in the Romanian part of the delta; trapping success changed dramatically between years, the best year was 2010 with 24 mink captured. Hence for the last decade there are no signs of decline, neither in range nor in number as far as the Romanian part of the Danube Delta and adjacent lagoons in the south are concerned (A. Kranz pers. comm. 2006).Belarus: the species is considered to be extinct in former two small range fragments (Sidorovich pers comm. 2011).Ukraine: the European Mink was recently re-discovered in Danube and Dniester deltas (de Jongh et al. 2007).Russia: in most of the country, in 61 regions (subcountry units) within the species historical range it is extinct or believed to be extinct (40 regions, 66%). In seven regions that species is known to be extant, and in nine regions it is believed to still survive. From those, only for 12 regions the European mink is expected to survive for longer than 10 years. The American Mink is now present within the whole remaining range of the European Mink, though may be absent or very low in numbers in Northern Caucasus and in the north - approximately 64¬∞‚Äì66¬∞N, 44¬∞‚Äì52¬∞E (near Timanskiy kriazh, to Polar ring).",Decreasing,"The historical range of the European Mink extended from Finland to east of Ural Mountains, to northern Spain and Caucasian Mountains (Novikov 1939, Heptner et al. 1967, Youngman 1990, Maran 2007). The relatively recent discovery of mink in France (1839) and in eastern Spain (1951) suggests late expansion of the species to the west (Youngman 1990, Michaux et al. 2005). However, over the last 150 years it has severely declined and been extirpated or greatly reduced over most of its former range (Maran 1999, Maran 2007 and references therein).The current range consists of few isolated fragments: in northern Spain and western France, in Danube delta in Romania, in the Ukraine and Russia (Maran 2007 and references therein). It occurs from sea level to 1,120 m (Palaz√≥n et al. 2003).The species is still extant in only a minor part of its former range and is in decline even in its currently remaining range enclaves. Only Romania and Vologotsk Region and Arkhangelsk Region can, perhaps, be regarded as exceptions. In Romania, the presence of the European Mink in Danube Delta was confirmed relatively recently (Gotea and Kranz 1999). The European Mink seems to be still widespread there. Repeated live-trapping surveys since 2001 indicate that mink inhabit the area of no more than 2,500 km¬≤ (e.g., Kranz et al. 2006). In Vologodsk Region, considering the rapid decline of the species in the neighbouring regions and the presence of the American Mink, it is not likely that the European Mink populations will hold there for long. In the Arkhangelsk Region, the population seems to exist in the northwest of the region, which is close to the northern limit of the range with very low abundance of the species. The presence of the American Mink (Neovison vison) is likely to pose a serious threat to its long-term existence also there (Skumatov 2005, Maran 2007 and references therein).","The species was largely used in fur trade during the first half of the 20th century. At present, there is no data on trade. The higher quality of farmed American Mink fur makes it highly unlikely that the trading could become an issue in European Mink conservation.&#160;&#160; ",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"It is legally protected in all range states (Schreiber et al. 1989).

At present small core population exists in the island, but it is not yet viable; (b) studies on reproductive physiology of the species, studies on survival and adaptation of the species in reintroduction programs, studies on genetics, studies on the impact of captive conditions to the stress of mink; (c) regular monitoring of the results of establishment of island population in Hiiumaa.Romania: (a) since 2001 regular monitoring has been conducted in Danube delta; (b) in 2011, the strategic plan for European Mink conservation was elaborated in the European Mink handbook for the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve (Marinov et al. 2011).Studies have been undertaken to determine the mink's ecological requirements, to analyse the causes of its decline, and to assess the genetic variability, the survival of released captive-born European Mink. New studies have been launched to study reproductive physiology, impact of captive conditions, options for artificial insemination, effect of behavioural personality types in mink to conservation breeding and reintroduction. There is an urgent need for a species action plan in the European Union for European Mink for better collaboration between different ongoing conservation activities. Clearly national and regional authorities need to increase attention and allocate sufficient and continued resources for European Mink conservation, otherwise this species will disappear soon. There is a need for large-scale coordinated efforts to secure the survival of the last small remaining populations in different areas inside of the historical range of the species, but also restoration and/or establishment of new populations is required.Conservation breeding of the species needs all-European coordination so that all single-country initiatives collaborate. Current tendency for isolated one-country breeding efforts will lead to ineffective use of resources and of competence, but also to inability to reach the captive population size sufficient enough to maintain genetic diversity in captivity. For remaining in situ populations, the maintenance or restoration of sufficiently large areas of suitable habitats has to be secured by designation of new protected areas and improvement of management of existing protected areas. The impact of the American mink on local European Mink populations has to be monitored and controlled, and whenever possible and feasible the alien mink populations should be removed. Local authorities have to pay more attention to the effects of the American Mink on the local fauna, including the European Mink. They should support further studies and actions to mitigate the effect of alien mink to the native mink species. For example, intensive control of American Mink is ongoing in Spain since 2001. More than 3,000 American Minks have been eradicated around and inside the European Mink distribution area. It is likely that without such a control of alien mink the native mink population in Spain would have vanished already (Gomez and Palazon pers. comm.).For French and Spanish wild populations which appear to be highly inbred further research needs to be carried out to identify whether these seemingly genetically highly uniform populations suffer from inbreeding depression. The introduction of individuals from ex situ stock from genetically diverse eastern populations has to be considered as a potential conservation measure, if further research confirms the need for this. In addition to genetic studies, comparative studies on ecology and behaviour of the disjunct mink populations (Spanish/French, Romanian and eastern European) should also be conducted to support the findings of genetic studies. The ex situ conservation breeding program has to be enhanced and promoted, as it guarantees the survival of the species in case in situ efforts temporarily fail. It also provides opportunities for the restoration of already vanished wild populations and reinforcement of existing populations whenever needed. Better coordination between different ex situ actions over political borders is needed. Special studies have to be conducted to find the most feasible way to incorporate the western low-variability populations into the joint program with high-diversity eastern population.&#160; There is also a need for developing an all-European conservation breeding program with secured long-term funding. Further studies are needed about the current status of the European mink in Romania, Ukraine and elsewhere in eastern parts of Europe.",Palearctic,,False,False,Europe,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
689,North Asia,Huso dauricus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,ACIPENSERIFORMES,ACTINOPTERYGII,ACIPENSERIDAE,Huso,dauricus,A2bd,The species has undergone a sharp decline in both stock and recruitment. The dramatic stock decline began in the late 19th century and continues to the present day. From the late 19th century to 1992 the population has experienced a decline of more than 80%. During the last ten to fifteen years a very large decrease in the abundance of this species has occurred. The average age of fishes is subsequently decreasing as a result of catch of adults by poachers for caviar. This has resulted in females reproducing only once in their lifetime. This species has therefore been assessed as Critically Endangered.,"Habitat: All types of benthic habitats in large rivers and lakes of the Amur River basin. Biology: Semi-anadromous (anadromous fishes spend at least part of their life in salt water and return to rivers to breed). The Kaluga Sturgeon spawns in lower reaches of the Amur River in strong-current habitats in the main stream of the river on gravel or sandy-gravel bottom. Spawning peaks from the end of May to July. Adults spawn many times during their life cycle. Spawning periodicity is 4-5 years in females and 3-4 years in males. The generation length of the species is not less than 20 years (Krykhtin and Svirskii 1997, Berg 1948).","The causes of the population decline are still overfishing, both legal and poaching (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007). Recently, environmental pollution in the Amur River basin threatens the habitat and reproduction of this species (Shmigirilov et al. 2007, Chen 2007).","Currently, complete population data based on results of direct counts and fishery statistics do not exist for this species. A decline of catches has been observed since the end of the 19th century (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007). Towards the end of the 19th century, annual catch was approximately 500 tonnes. Before 1992 the annual catch was 92 tonnes. This indicates a greater than 80% decline in catches over 90 years (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007).A hatchery is located in Luchegorsk at Khabarovsk district which contains a living collection of eight species of sturgeons (including the Kaluga Sturgeon) and hybrids. In 2007, this hatchery attempted the first re-stocking of juveniles of this this species into the Amur River.",Decreasing,"The Kaluga Sturgeon inhabits the entire Amur River basin from the estuary to the river‚Äôs upper reaches. It occurs in tributaries - the Shilka, Onon, Argun, Nerch, Sungari, Nonni and Ussuri and Neijiang Rivers (Krykhtin and Svirskii 1997). It rarely occurs in Lake Khanka. Young specimens also appear in the coastal waters of the Sea of Okhotsk, near the northeastern part of the Tatar Strait, and in the Sea of Japan near the islands of Hokkaido and Honshu (Krykhtin and Svirskii 1997, Shmigirilov et al. 2007). There are two separate populations in the Amur River tributaries - Zeya River and Bureya River (Krykhtin and Svirskii 1997, Shmigirilov et al. 2007, Chen 2007).",This species is removed from the wild for human consumption and research.,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The majority of 'conservation' measures historically were directed to control local and national fisheries. Commercial sturgeon fishing was prohibited in the Soviet Union during the periods 1923-1930, 1958-1976 and from 1984 to the present (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007).

690,North Asia,Huso huso,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,ACIPENSERIFORMES,ACTINOPTERYGII,ACIPENSERIDAE,Huso,huso,A2bcd,"The species was historically known from the Caspian, Black, Azov and Adriatic Sea basins. It has been extirpated from the Adriatic (in the early 1970s, Gessner pers. comm.) and Azov Seas due to overfishing and loss of spawning sites due to dams. As the species is very long lived, individuals can still be caught in areas where their spawning sites have been cut off off and no spawning is possible. The last wild population in the Black Sea basin migrates up the Danube river. All other Black Sea stocks are almost extirpated due to overfishing and impoundment of spawning rivers. In the Caspian basin, the last wild population migrates up the River Ural. The Volga population depends on stocking as the construction of Volgograd dam led to the loss of almost all of the species spawning sites in the river. Most of the few recorded females are in their first year of maturation. Based on catch data, and number of recorded spawning individuals it is estimated that the species has seen a wild native population decline of over 90% in the past three generations (a minimum of 60 years) and overfishing for meat and caviar will soon cause global extinction of the remaining natural wild populations. In the immediate future, survival can only depend on stocking and effective fisheries management and combating illegal fishing. Range states are also encouraged to provide protection to the species spawning and feeding grounds.European Union 27 = CR A2bcd. The species is known from the Adriatic (migrated up the Po river) and the Danube up to Germany. However it now only occurs in lower Danube below the Iron Gate II dam, it was extirpated from the Adriatic in the early 1970s. Catches in the Danube have declined, in the mid Danube the annual catch was 23 tonnes (avg. 1972 -1976) which dropped to 7.5 tonnes (avg. 1985 - 1989) showing a decline of 67% in around 12 years (CITES Doc. AC.16.7.2). In 2002 21.3t caught in Romania, in 2005 only 8.4t caught (60% decline). the percentage of catch quota achieved in Romania was 85% in 2002, 84% in 2003, 46% in 2004, in 2005 only 34%. In 2006 the harvesting of the species was banned. Release of recruit size (over 15cm long) from Romania into the Danube was 12,500 in 2006; 15,130 in 2007 and 20,000 in 2008. Based on catch data, and number of spawning individuals it is estimated that the species has seen a population decline of over 90% in the past 3 generations (min of 60 years).","At sea, this species is found in the pelagic zone, following food organisms. It migrates further upriver to spawn than any other sturgeon; however this migration has now been disrupted due to river regulation (in the Danube drainage up to Morava River). It spawns in strong-current habitats in the main course of large and deep rivers on stone or gravel bottom. This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Males reproduce for the first time at 10-15 years, females at 15-18 years, with an estimated generation length of 20-25 years. This species spawns every 3-4 years in April-June. A complicated pattern of spawning migrations includes one peak in late winter and spring and one in late summer and autumn. In spring, it migrates from the sea before spawning. Individuals migrating in autumn remain in the rivers until the following spring. Spawning occurs at temperature from 6 to 14 ¬∞C in the channel and spring flooded spawning grounds at a current speed of 0.8-1.2 m / sec. Spawners the late winter/spring run dominate the spawners in the Volga River (80%), whereas the late summer/autumn&#160; run dominates in the Ural River. Yolk-sac larvae are pelagic for 7-8 days and drift with current. Juveniles migrate to sea during their first summer and remain there until maturity. In the past this species was the largest fish of the Caspian Sea, reaching lengths of more than 5 m and a weight of 1,000 kg. The lifetime of such large specimens, apparently, exceeded 100 years. Currently there are individuals up to 280 cm, weighing up to 650 kg. Average length of females is 240, males is 220 cm, weight respectively is 130 and 65 kg. The maximum age of 53 years was observed in 2003. &#160;Various environmental factors influence the distribution of the species in the Caspian Sea. One factor is water temperature, as mature Beluga prefer water temperatures not exceeding 30¬∞C. They spend the spring and summer mostly in the northern and middle parts of the Caspian Sea and then move southwards to spend the winter in the southern areas, which coincides with highest densities of food organisms. The diet includes roach (Rutilus), carp (Cyprinus), herrings (Alosa), kilka (Clupeonella), crayfish (Astacus), gobies (Gobiidae), pike-perch (Sander ), birds, sturgeons (Acipenseridae), and even seals (Phocidae) (Khodorevskaya et al., 1995). Mature individuals of Beluga are less sensitive to low temperature than the immature, as they feed in the northern part of the Caspian Sea under the ice. With water temperatures decreasing, Belugas reduce the range of depths at which they feed. In spring and autumn immature individuals prefer the more desalinated sea areas. In summer the highest concentrations occur at the salinity of 3 to 7%. The largest concentrations of Beluga in the northern Caspian occur during the migration of its main prey organisms (herrings, kilka, gobies, roach, etc.).","Overfishing at sea and poaching in estuaries and rivers for meat and caviar is a major threat to the species. Overharvesting and a sharp increase in poaching has led to the largest and most mature specimens being removed from the population and reducing natural reproduction to almost zero (Krassikov and Fedin 1996). In the Ural river current fishing rates are 4 to 5 times sustainable levels (F Max) (Doukakis et al. accepted). Bycatch is also a threat to the species. The species caviar is very high value (8,000 USD per kilo in 2009).Impoundment of rivers has destroyed most of the species spawning grounds. The Volgograd dam, built in 1955, has decreased the area of available spawning grounds by 88-100% in the Volga river, similar areas have been reduced in the Terek and Sulak rivers from 132 ha and 202 ha, respectively. The Don river dam removed 68,000 ha of spawning ground and flow regulation in the Kuban river led to the loss of 140,000 ha (CITES 2000).Due to the longevity of the species pesticide contamination, leading to many problems including reduced reproductive success is also suspected (Gessner, J. pers comm.).The Allee effect could also be a threat to the species.","Global fisheries statistics show that there has been a 93% decline in catch from 1992 (520 tonnes) to 2007 (33 tonnes) (FAO 2009).The number of Beluga annually entering the Volga dropped from 26,000 (1961-65) to 2,800 (1998-2002), a decline of 89% in 33 years (Khodorevskaya et al. 2009). Only 2,500 migrated up Ural in 2002 (Pikitch et al. 2005). Currently it is thought that nearly 100% of Beluga in the Volga are hatchery reared, but there is evidence of spawning elsewhere in its distribution (Khodorevskaya et al. 2009). Despite intensive restocking in the Caspian Sea (91% of each generation is estimated to come from hatchery stock), the annual catch in the northern Caspian Sea has drastically fallen. Catches in the Caspian were: 1945-55 average of 1,380 tonnes; 1956-65 average of 1,283 tonnes; 1966-75 average of 1,623 tonnes; 1976-85 average of 849 tonnes; 1986-95 average of 506 tonnes; 1996-2003 (latest data) average of 60.8 tonnes (in Doukakis et al. accepted). This shows a decline of 95%. The official catch statistics support this trend, as they show that the species was abundant in 1938 and then stable to the late 1980s, with the major decline starting from 1990 to the present showing over a 90% decline in the past 60 years (see Khodorevskaya et al. 2009). The agreed Beluga catch quota for all of the Caspian Sea (2007/8 - 28th session of the Commission) was 99.8 tonnes; this quota was not achieved. The proportion of Beluga (to other sturgeon species) in trawl catches of the northern Caspian Sea in all seasons of observations was at an average of 11%. Over the recent years, this percentage has decreased to 8.3%, and the catch of beluga during trawl surveys did not exceed 31 specimens per year&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;et al. 2009).Spawning numbers for the Volga from 1961-65 was 26,000, whilst in 1996/1997 it was 1,800 (Khodorevskaya et al. 2000), with 2,800 in 1998-2002 (Khodorevskaya et al. 2009).In the Sea of Azov, between 1979-1981 it is estimated that 551,000 individuals existed (from stocked, and dominated by sub-adult and juveniles); in 1988-1993 there were 25,000 and after 1994 they were only caught sporadically, despite banning of commercial fishing of Beluga in 1986. After 1986 the major threat was from bycatch. Since 1994, 98% of individuals recorded in the Azov Sea have been juvenile. In 2001 the first individuals were produced from captive bred individuals and released (Chebanov and Koziritskaya 2007).Catches in the Danube have also declined. In the mid-Danube the annual catch was 23 tonnes (average between 1972-76) which dropped to 7.5 tonnes (average between 1985-89), a decline of 67% in around 12 years (CITES 2000). In 2002, 21.3 tonnes were caught in Romania, whilst only 8.4 tonnes were caught in 2005, showing a 60% decline in three years. The percentage of catch quota achieved in Romania was 85% in 2002, 84% in 2003, 46% in 2004, and 34% in 2005. In 2006 the catching of Beluga was banned in the Danube (Paraschiv et al. 2006).",Decreasing,"This species has been recorded in the basins of the Caspian, Black, Azov, and Adriatic Seas, however its current native wild distribution is restricted to the Black Sea (in the Danube only) and the Caspian Sea (in the Ural only). It is one of the largest anadromous fish in the Caspian Sea, where at least three Beluga populations have been identified by microsatellite technique (Pourkazemi 2008). It does occur in the Azov Sea, and Volga River but these are stocked fish.",This species is targeted for its skin and as a leather. Caviar is also used as cosmetic and medicinal purposes. Intestine use as sauce (food) and to produce gelatine. Swim bladder used to produce glue.,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"This species was listed on CITES Appendix II in 1998. Restocking programmes are ongoing. However the programmes do not compensate for the loss of natural reproduction and the populations continue to decline (CITES 2000). The annual number of fingerlings released into the Volga show 0.4 million in 1951; 13.1 million between 1966-70 (average per year); 19.4 million between 1981-85; 11.3 million between 1996-2000; and 3 million between 2001-2005 (Khodorevskaya et al. 2009). The Report of the 28th Session of Caspian Bioresource Commission states that the total fingerling release of beluga in 2008 was 7.02 million from Russia, Iran and Khazakstan. Some natural reproduction of the species remains in the Volga and Ural Rivers. However, at present the abundance of Beluga is extremely low. Since 2000 in Russia, it has only been caught for the purposes of reproduction (for hatcheries) and science. The protective measures at the feeding grounds are necessary to maintain the population of beluga, as well as the preservation of natural spawning and juveniles breeding at hatcheries.In the Danube the release of recruitment size (over 15 cm long) from Romania into the Danube has risen from 12,500 in 2006, to 15,130 in 2007 and 20,000 in 2008 (Suciu pers. comm.).Iran, in work with the World Bank, are increasing the rate of release of Beluga; in 2003, 6,000 individuals (CWT tagged and visible tagged) were released. The size of the released individuals has been increased from 3-5 g to 10-25 g to increase survival rates (Pourali et al. 2003). Hatchery experts (which are state owned) are given financial incentives upon the delivery of individuals ready to be released. Iran has also developed beluga farming to supply meat and caviar production to minimize the impact to the wild population (Pourkazemi pers. comm.).The species is not fully protected in any range state, though fishing licences are required in most countries and Iran has banned private sturgeon fisheries. Overall however, enforcement measures seem to be lacking. In 1996, fishing in the open sea for the species was banned through an agreement between the countries bordering the Caspian Sea. Artificial spawning grounds have been attempted below Volgograd dam, which has shown some success (Ruban pers. comm.). In the Sea of Azov commercial fishing was banned in 1986.Gene banks, DNA and tissue cryopreservation exists in Iran and Russia.Azerbaijan have voluntarily proposed a zero quota for Caviar export for 2009 to CITES.Range states are also encouraged to provide protection to the species spawning and feeding grounds.",Palearctic,,False,False,Europe,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1

There are fewer than 250 mature individuals in the region, each subpopulation is &lt;50 and is completely isolated (from each other and from populations outside the assessment region). The regional population is undergoing continuing decline.","The leopard has the widest habitat tolerance of any Old World felid, ranging from rainforest to desert. In Africa, they are most successful in woodland, grassland savanna and forest but also occur widely in mountain habitats, coastal scrub, swampy areas, shrubland, semi-desert and desert. They range from sea level to as much as 4,600 m on Mt Kenya (Hunter et al. in press). In Southwest and Central Asia, leopards formerly occupied a range of habitats, but now are confined chiefly to the more remote montane and rugged foothill areas. Through India and Southeast Asia, Leopard are found in all forest types, from tropical rainforest to the temperate deciduous and alpine coniferous (up to 5,200 m in the Himalaya), and also occur in dry scrub and grasslands (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Leopards have extremely catholic diets including more than 90 species in sub-Saharan Africa, ranging from arthropods to large antelope up to the size of adult male Eland Tragelaphus oryx (Hunter et al. in press). Densities vary with habitat, prey availability, and degree of threat, from fewer than one per 100 km¬≤ to over 30 per 100 km¬≤, with highest densities obtained in protected East and southern African mesic woodland savannas (Hunter et al. in press).A study in Thailand found a home range of 8.8 km¬≤ for a radio-collared female, and 17.3-18 km¬≤ for two adult males (Grassman 1998). Important prey species were hog badger Arctonyx collaris (45.9%), muntjac Muntiacus muntjak (20.9%) and wild pig Sus scrofa (6.3%).","Throughout Africa, the major threats to Leopard are habitat conversion and intense persecution, especially in retribution for real and perceived livestock loss (Ray et al. 2005). In intact rainforest, the chief threat to Leopards is probably competition with human hunters for prey; the tremendous volume of wild meat harvests denudes forests of prey and may drive localized extinctions. Nonetheless, Leopard are somewhat tolerant of habitat conversion, and may persist close to large human populations provided they have suitable cover and prey (Hunter et al. in press). Leopard come into conflict with people across their range. A rapidly increasing threat to Leopards is the poisoning of carcasses targeting carnivores, either as a means of predator control or incidentally. The impact of trophy hunting on populations is unclear, but may have impacts at the demographic and population level, especially when females are shot. In Tanzania, which allows only males to be hunted, females comprised 28.6% of 77 trophies shot between 1995 and 1998 (Spong et al. 2000). Skins and canines are still widely traded domestically in some central and West African countries where parts are used in traditional rituals and sold openly in villages and cities (Hunter et al. in press). Djibouti is an important conduit for Leopard skins from East Africa that are bought mainly by French military personnel and carried illegally to Europe. In West Asia, small leopard subpopulations are threatened primarily by habitat fragmentation, killing in defence of livestock, and poaching for trade (Habibi 2004, Breitenmoser et al. 2006, Breitenmoser et al. 2007).In Indo-Malaya, leopards are threatened primarily by habitat loss (deforestation) as well as poaching for illegal trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In India, leopards are feared for their attacks on people (Singh 2005).","The leopard is an adaptable, widespread species that nonetheless has many threatened subpopulations. While still numerous and even thriving in some marginal habitats from which other big cats have disappeared in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, in North Africa leopards are on the verge of extinction. There are no reliable continent-wide estimates of population size in Africa, and the most commonly cited estimate of over 700,000 leopards in Africa (Martin and de Meulenaar 1988) is flawed. In India, based on pugmark censuses (a methodology which has been criticized as inaccurate), 9,844 leopards were estimated in 2001. Many populations are believed to be increasing, and there are high levels of human-leopard conflict (Singh 2005).Several Asian subspecies are included on the Red List, with population information as follows:Amur leopard P.p. orientalis CR C2a(ii),D: 14-20 (Anon. 2007)Arabian leopard P.p. nimr CR C2a(I): &lt;200 (Breitenmoser 2006, Spalton and Al Hikmani 2006)Javan leopard P.p. melas CR C2a(i): 323-525, with &lt;250 mature breeding adults (A. Ario pers. comm. 2007)Sri Lankan leopard P.p. kotiya EN C2a(i): 700-950 (Kittle and Watson 2007)Persian leopard P.p. saxicolor EN C2a(i): 871-1290 (Khorozyan et al., 2005; Lukarevsky et al. 2007)",Decreasing,"The leopard occurs across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as remnant populations in North Africa, and then in the Arabian peninsula and Sinai/Judean Desert (Egypt/Israel/Jordan), south-western and eastern Turkey, and through Southwest Asia and the Caucasus into the Himalayan foothills, India, China and the Russian Far East, as well as on the islands of Java and Sri Lanka (Nowell and Jackson 1996; Sunquist and Sunquist 2002; Hunter et al. in press). In sub-Saharan Africa, leopards remain widely, albeit now patchily, distributed within historical limits (see Hunter et al. in press, and references therein). Ray et al. (2005) estimated that leopards have disappeared from at least 36.7% of their historical range in Africa. The most marked range loss has been in the Sahel belt, as well as in Nigeria and South Africa. They have been locally extirpated from areas densely populated with people or where habitat conversion is extreme (Hunter et al. in press). They are likely extinct on Zanzibar, where there have been no confirmed records since 1996 (Hunter et al. in press). In North Africa, a tiny relict population persists in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco (Cuzin 2003), and there was a probable observation on the Morocco-Algerian border in Figuig in 2007 (F. Cuzin pers. comm.), while a population was recently found in the Ahaggar of south-eastern Algeria, a region from which they had not previously been recorded (Busby et al. 2006). Leopard are likely extinct in Egypt, although they may occur in the Eastern Desert (Hunter et al. in press).A 2006 Arabian Fauna Conservation Workshop estimated there were fewer than 200 leopards remaining on the Arabian peninsula, in three confirmed separate subpopulations: the Negev desert, the Wada'a mountains of Yemen, and the Dhofar mountains of Oman. Presence in Saudi Arabia is uncertain (Breitenmoser 2006, Spalton and Al Hikmani 2006). I. Khorozyan (pers. comm. 2008) compiled detailed country information on the distribution of the Endangered Persian leopard as follows:Russian North Caucasus: mountain ridges in the headwaters of the Avarskoe Koisu and Andiiskoe Koisu rivers (Republic of Dagestan). Possibly exists in the Chegem River canyon (Kabardino-Balkarian Republic); Erzi Reserve, Assa River valley (Republic of Ingushetia); Armkhi River basin (Republic of North Osetia-Alania), headwaters of the Sharoargun and Argun rivers (Chechen Republic) (Akkiev and Mokaev, 2006; Khorozyan and Abramov, 2007; Lukarevsky et al., 2007). Georgia: Vashlovani Reserve in the south-east; Arkhoti River canyon in the upper part of the Assa River basin and the headwaters of the Andiiskoe Koisu River in the north-east (Lukarevsky et al., 2007). Some anecdotal records from south-western Georgia are either unreliable or can be attributed to individuals coming from north-eastern Turkey (Arabuli, 2006; Khorozyan and Abramov, 2007).Armenia: south-western and southern parts of the country from Khosrov Reserve to the Armenian-Iranian state border throughout the Geghama, Zangezur, Aiotsdzor, Bargushat and Meghri ridges. The range boundaries are the Azat River in the north-west; Vardenis Ridge in the north; semi-desert of the Ararat Valley in the west; state border with Azerbaijan and the alpine meadow/nival belt transition zone in the south-west and east; Arax River basin along the Armenian-Iranian border in the south. Until the early 1970s it lived also in north-eastern parts of Armenia (Khorozyan et al., 2005; Khorozyan and Abramov, 2007). Azerbaijan: Talysh Mts. in the extreme south-east, Akhar-Bakhar Ridge of the Iori-Mingechaur Highland in the north-west and the Zangezur Ridge in the Nakhichevan Republic along the state border with Armenia in the west (Lukarevsky et al., 2007). Nagorno-Karabakh Republic: distribution in Shushi, Mardakert and Hadrut districts and in the adjoining Kelbajar district was recorded in 1941-1967 (Alekperov, 1966; Sludsky, 1973). Up-to-date information on leopard status is impossible to obtain for the political tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan over this republic, even though it plays a vital role as a corridor between the southern (Armenia, Azerbaijan's Nakhichevan Republic), central (Iori-Mingechaur Highland in Azerbaijan and Vashlovani Reserve in Georgia) and northern (Russian North Caucasus) parts of the Caucasus (Khorozyan and Abramov, 2007). Iran: virtually all country, except the vast deserts of Desht-e-Kevir and Desht-e-Lut in central and eastern parts. Particularly common in the Alborz Mts. along the southern fringe of the Caspian Sea. Quite common in protected areas (e.g., Tandooreh, Sarigol, Bafgh, Golestan, Kolah'ghazy, Touran, Kavir, Khojir, Khabr and Bamu national parks; Kiamaki and Naybandan wildlife refuges; Jahan Nama, Central Alborz, Varjin, Arasbaran, Dena and Bahram'gur protected areas) and some unprotected lands (Chapur-Ghoymeh, Safee Abad-Dozain or Minoo Dasht, Ramsar, Khaeez and Darestan-Rudbar) (Joslin and Shoemaker 1988; Kiabi et al., 2002; Farhadinia et al. 2007; Abdoli et al. 2008; M Farhadinia and A. Ghoddousi pers. comms., 2008). Turkey: north-east (around the Artvin city), east (vicinities of Mt. Ararat or Agri) and south-east (Bitlis Ridge). Possibly exists in the mountains of the Black Sea coast and south-westwards to the Taurus Mts. (H. Diker pers. comm., 2008). It is unclear whether leopards still survive in western Turkey.Turkmenistan: western Kopetdag Ridge, central Kopetdag Ridge, eastern Kopetdag Ridge, Badkhyz Reserve and Giaz-Gyadyk Ridge (Lukarevsky, 2001). Afghanistan: central (Hindu Kush, Kohe Baba, Kohe Paghman and Safed Koh ranges of the central highlands), north-eastern (Wakhan corridor) and northern (Darkad peninsula of Badakshan) parts of the country (Habibi, 2004).In the Central Asian republics, leopard distribution is poorly known. Historically, leopards had a wider distribution in Turkmenistan, and were found in parts of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. An old male leopard was killed by a local hunter in January 2000 in Kazakhstan, the first record of the species in this country, in a location over 600 km from possible occurrences in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and over 1,200 km from known occurrences in Turkmenistan. It is aplso possible that the leopard travelled along the foothills of the Pamirs, then proceeded via the Ugam and Pskem ranges into the Talas river valley. Habitat appears to be suitable, but the existence of any leopard subpopulation in any of these three countries is uncertain (Shakula 2004).In Pakistan, the leopard is thinly distributed in montane areas, and there have only been a handful of confirmed records in recent years (Ahmed 2001).Leopards occur widely in the forests of the Indian sub-continent, through Southeast Asia and into China, although they are becoming increasingly rare outside protected areas. They are not found on the islands of Borneo or Sumatra (Nowell and Jackson 1996).",,Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I. Legal international traffic is limited largely to exports of skins and hunting trophies under a CITES Appendix I quota system by 13 African countries (2005 CITES quota is 2,590). Leopards are protected under national legislation throughout most of their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Africa, although Leopards occur in numerous protected areas across their range, the majority of the population occurs outside of protected areas, necessitating a need for improved conflict mitigation measures (including livestock management, conflict resolution) (Hunter et al. in press). In West Asia, leopards are essentially restricted to protected areas, many of which are too small to support viable populations, and need expansion through buffer zones and connectivity through corridors (Breitenmoser et al. 2006, 2007). In Indo-Malaya and China, leopards need better protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Mediterranean,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

Prefers clay soil open spaces covered with grass and avoids rugged terrain as well as sandy areas. A migratory species with widely separated summer (northern) and winter (southern) ranges. Lives in large herds, usually up to thousand individuals. Heat is at the beginning of winter when males defend harems of females. Gives birth in April-May to two, more seldom to one calf.","Uncontrolled illegal hunting for horns (male horns are exported for the traditional Chinese medicine trade) and meat since the break-up of the former USSR has led to the catastrophic fall in numbers. Selective hunting of young males and subsequent distortion of the sex ratio has affected reproduction: recent research shows that heavily skewed sex ratios are resulting in reproductive collapse (Milner-Gulland et al. 2003). A second significant threat is the destruction of key habitats and traditional migration routes. Agricultural abandonment is a problem in some areas; cattle grazing formerly maintained the grassy species but land abandonment allows another species (Stippa sp.) to encroach, which the saiga cannot eat. The recent increase in steppe fires is a further cause for concern. Severe winters can cause mass mortality.","Historically, it was a common species in Eurasian steppes and semideserts. From information provided in recent references it appears that between 1991 and 1994, the global population of S. tatarica was relatively stable at just under one million animals, the majority of which were in Kazakhstan (approximately 810,00-825,000) (Bekenov et al. 1998, Lushchekina et al. 1999, Sokolov and Zhirnov 1998).

Determined using RAMAS Red List software. We used the software default settings for dispute tolerance and risk tolerance.  The IUCN criteria used to estimate the population size reduction for a species can include the following: direct observations, indices of abundance, declines in area of occupancy or extent of occurrence and/or quality of the habitat, actual or potential levels of exploitation, or effects of introduced taxa, hybridization, pathogens, pollutants, competitors or parasites. We relied on four primary sources of information to document declines in population abundance (in Russia) and habitat (in Japan). Below we include documentation of our data sources and our analytical approaches:  1. Khabarovsk bycatch time series  We obtained data on bycatch of Sakhalin taimen in commercial fisheries (primarily gill net captures) along the Sea of Japan coast in Khabarovsk during 1951‚Äì1998. These data have been reported in a number of publications (Zolotukhin et al. 2000, Zolotukhin et al. 2002). Data are reported as weight (in 1,000 kg) of landed biomass of taimen (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). We parsed the data into three discrete periods to account for different prevailing social and economic conditions for the fishery. We identified the first period (1951‚Äì1964) as the most reliable time series, where bycatch reporting rate was high and consistent. We fit a exponential model to these data and estimated a rate of decline of the regional population at -9% yr-1. Assuming an average weight of captured taimen at 5 kg, the total harvest during this period ranged from ~800 to ~4,000 individuals yr-1, most likely representing the peak bycatch fishery yield for the species in this region. We fit an exponential model to a second time series that extended from 1972‚Äì1979, a period marked by a growing black market for the species, resulting in under-reported bycatch. The rate of decline during this period was estimated at -23% yr-1. We fit the remaining data in the time series (1980‚Äì1998) to a separate exponential model. This period can be characterized by continued under-reporting of bycatch, and includes recreational landings beginning in the mid-1990s. The model fit to these data suggested the regional population declined by -12% yr-1.  2. Sakhalin bycatch time series  We obtained data on bycatch of Sakhalin taimen in the commercial fishery located in the Nogliki region of Sakhalin Island during 1971‚Äì1997. These data were compiled by SakhNIRO, the regional fisheries agency on Sakhalin. Data are reported as weight (in 100 kg) of landed biomass of taimen (see Figure 3 in the Supplementary Material). Assuming an average weight for captured taimen at 5 kg, peak harvest during this time series was ~ 3,000 individuals yr-1, occurring in 1974. We fit these data to an exponential model, and estimated the slope of the regression of log(catch) vs. year. This time series suggests a rate of reduction of the population of 11% yr-1 over the period of record (26 yr). The rate of decline of the older members of the population in the region is thought to be even more dramatic (S.N. Safronov, Sakhalin State University, pers. comm.).  3. Estimate of exploitation rate on the Koppi River population  Catch and age composition data from the Koppi River population was obtained during 2000-2002. Gill nets and angling were the primary methods of capture. Captured individuals were aged by scale analysis (N = 131). We fit a regression of log (catch) vs. age for individuals aged 3-16 to estimate Z, total instantaneous mortality rate of the population (see Figure 4 in the Supplementary Material). This assumes that taimen are fully recruited to the fishing gear by age 3, and that the age composition of the catch is representative of the true population in the river. Our estimate for Z is 0.307 (or -26 % yr-1). Assuming natural mortality (M) to be 0.11 (see above), we estimated fishing mortality by difference (F = Z - M, F = 0.197). The resulting value for fishing mortality is ~ two times the rate of natural mortality of the population. Annual rate of fishing mortality is estimated at -18% yr-1. This mortality rate is within the range of estimated population loss rates based on the bycatch time series for Khabarovsk estimated above (-9, -12, and -23% yr-1). While this may be an overestimate of fishing mortality based on difficulties associated with sampling older, mature individuals in the Koppi River population, it does represent the most comprehensive effort to date to provide a reliable sample of the age composition and relative abundance of a river population of Sakhalin taimen.  4. Hokkaido taimen fry survey  Trend data for the species abundance in Hokkaido, Japan are not available. A comparison of results from redd surveys conducted during 1991 and 1998 in the Sarufutsu River in northern Hokkaido indicated no marked changes over time in spawner abundance for this population (M. Fukushima, JMOE unpubl. data). We feel that that this data set is not representative given the short period of observation, and that the region has seen much less change in land use compared to other regions in Hokkaido. Here we rely on a study on presence/absence for the species in Hokkaido to scale the magnitude of habitat loss for the species. Edo (2001) concluded that the range of the species has been reduced by 57% based on an extensive survey of juvenile taimen (fry, or young-of-the-year) during 2000. The survey involved electrofishing reaches in a total of 30 study streams that were thought to support the species historically (Edo 2001). Fry were observed in a total of 13 study streams, representing 43% of the historic range currently occupied. We acknowledge the likelihood of error by relying on fry absence based on a one-time survey as evidence of extirpation, but we feel this is the best available data to allow us to gauge habitat loss in this region. While numerous anecdotes exists for declining adult abundance in some river systems, we lack reliable time series data. One river, the Shiribetsu (located in southwestern Hokkaido), was recognized historically for it prized receational taimen fishery, but no longer supports adult spawners. Surveys for redds conducted since 1995 have indicated that this population has been extirpated (H. Kawamura, Hokkaido Fish Hatchery, pers. comm.).  Based on results of these analyses, and assuming a generation time of 14 yrs, we estimated regional population reductions over three generations (42 yr period) of 98% in Khabarovsk (based on -9% yr-1 using the most reliable time series), 99% in Sakhalin, and 57% in Hokkaido (based on range reduction using results of fry survey).","Preferred habitat for juvenile Sakhalin taimen is low gradient, coastal rivers (Fukushima 2000), and habitat for maturing and mature adults can extend into first and second order tributaries for spawning and lake and estuarine waters for feeding (Kawamura et al. 1983, Zolotukhin et al. 2000, Arai et al. 2004). Females construct redds (i.e. nests) at the lower ends of pools, where eggs are deposited into discrete egg pockets in benthic gravel (Fukushima 1994, Edo et al. 2000). Data suggests that the density of Sakhalin taimen redds is positively correlated with channel sinuosity (Fukushima 2000). Some populations on Hokkaido are thought to be restricted to freshwater, possibly related to their position near the southern limit of their range, as has been observed for Salvelinus spp. (e.g., Maekawa and Nakano 2002, Morita et al. 2005). The species is known to exhibit both freshwater and anadromous life histories. The species is long lived, slow growing and exhibits delayed age at maturity relative to other salmonids. The species is iteroparous (i.e. repeat spawns), and reaches sexual maturity at ages 6‚Äì8, and achieves peak fecundity at approximately age 15 (Zolotukhin et al. 2000). The species spawns during the spring to early summer, depending on location within their natural range. Peak spawning occurs during May-June along the Sea of Japan coast (Zolotukhin et al. 2000), late June in Sakhalin (Gritsenko et al. 1974), and mid-March to late April in eastern to northern Hokkaido (Kimura 1966, Fukushima 1994). Anadromous life history forms are thought to reside in estuarine waters during the summer growing season, and overwinter in lower reaches of rivers beginning in mid-September to late October (Zolotukhin et al. 2000). Diet is dominated by benthic invertebrates during years 1‚Äì2, followed by a transition to finfish and crustaceans as they mature. We fit a von Bertalanffy growth model to size at age data for taimen sampled in the following rivers: Kievka and Samarga in Primorye, Russia, Koppi in Khabarovsk, Russia, and several rivers in eastern Hokkaido, Japan. Data for Kievka and Samarga are obtained from Zolotukhin et al. (2000), data from eastern Hokkaido populations are from Yamashiro (1965), and data for the Koppi was obtained from field collections during 2000-2002 (N = 131 individuals, ranging in age from 1 to 16 yr, S. Zolotukhin, TINRO, unpubl. data). We fit the equation with Microsoft Excel Solver and estimated best fit parameters for the model (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). The parameters fit to the Koppi data set, representing our most comprehensive data set on size at age, are as follows: Linf (asymptotic length) = 227 cm TL (TL = total length), K (growth coefficient) = 0.07. Data in Figure 2 are plotted as FL (fork length, also known as AC in Russia), and values were converted to TL for model fitting using a length conversion equation of TL = 1.032*FL, Froese and Pauly 2005). Parameters for the other Russian populations were similar to the results for the Koppi. Growth for taimen in eastern Hokkaido appeared markedly lower than the Russian populations, and may be related to colder water temperatures characteristic of this region (M. Fukushima, pers. comm., see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). Growth rates observed for Sakhalin taimen inhabiting a brackish lagoon near the mouth of the Bekanbeushi River in eastern Hokkaido by Kawamura et al. (1983) is relatively low compared to the Russian populations, and is consistent with rates measured by Yamashiro (1965) within the same region. We compared these growth trajectories qualitatively to size at age based on scale back-calculations for 5 adults from Hokkaido's Shiribetsu River in western Hokkaido (H. Kawamura, Hokkaido Fish Hatchery, unpubl. data). Although the method used to generate this growth curve is not directly comparable to the methods applied to the other river populations, the general trajectory of growth for Shiribetsu taimen closely approximates growth for the faster growing, Russian populations. We decided to use the data from the Koppi River as the model for growth dynamics for the species given it is the largest set of data available, while acknowledging that it may not fully represent growth dynamics across the natural range of the species (particularly in eastern Hokkaido, as described above). Based on the parameter values derived for the Koppi River taimen, and assuming an average annual water temperature in the lower Koppi River of 10¬∞ C, we used the model of Pauly (1980) to estimate a rate of natural mortality (M) for the species of 0.11. We used this estimate of natural mortality to estimate Lopt (144 cm TL, the length class with the highest biomass for an unfished population) using the model of Beverton (1992). We then used the estimate of Lopt and the parameters from the von Bertalanffy growth model in the following formula to estimate generation time: -1.45 - ln(1- Lopt/L&lt;subinf)/K. The resulting estimate for generation time was 14 yr.","Overfishing by various sectors (commercial, recreational, and illegal take) is one of the most important threats to this species. Although Sakhalin taimen are no longer commercially harvested in Russia, they are still targets of legal and illegal subsistence fishing as they are prized for their large size and good flavor (Zolotukhin et al. 2000). While reporting of taimen bycatch in the commercial pink salmon fishery in Russia has declined in recent years, we feel this is a result of under-reporting and a general decline in region-wide abundance of the species in recent years. These populations are also under threat from dramatic changes to their habitat expected from planned logging operations. An expanded logging lease in the Samarga River basin, for example, extends now to 85% of the total watershed area, with construction of roads that could greatly impact many key tributaries. Rapidly expanding oil and gas development on Sakhalin Island, in particular the laying of pipelines across more than 24 rivers known to support Sakhalin taimen, is posing a growing threat to the species. In Japan, land development (including river channelization, dam construction, agricultural and urban expansion) represents an important threat to critical habitat for the species. The threat from poaching in Russia, while hard to quantify, may currently be one of the most significant threats to the species. During a research trip in 2005, two active poaching camps were discovered, and five dead, adult taimen were recovered that had been captured using illegal fishing gear. Four of these individuals were mature females carrying as many as 15,000 eggs each (P.S. Rand, WSC unpubl. data). During spring peak flows, spawners tend to aggregate in side channels off the main stem of the river, and become vulnerable to capture by large mesh gill nets. Our estimate of fishing mortality in the river, although uncertain given the lack of data, suggests a relatively high rate of exploitation (~ two times the rate of natural mortality). Sustainable fishing rates on wild fish populations rarely exceed the rate of natural mortality. FAO (1999) recommends a precautionary approach in data poor fisheries by restricting fishing mortality to below the rate of natural mortality.","Very little data exists on absolute population sizes for this species. Redd surveys have been conducted in a number of river systems in Hokkaido. This method is prone to error (see Dunham et al. 2001); however, it is the most commonly used method for enumerating adult abundance in this region. Estimates of total abundance generated from a redd survey by Edo (2001) for a number of Hokkaido rivers are as follows: Sorachi, 211; Uryu, 264; Bekanbeushi, 306; Toikanbetsu, 422; Kushiro, 21; Tokachi, 21; Shiribetsu, 0. We used data in Fukushima (1994) to estimate total spawner abundance of 153 individuals within two tributaries (Nino and Jyugo Creeks) of the Sarufutsu River in northwestern Hokkaido (assuming 2 redds per female and a 50:50 sex ratio) based on sampling conducted during 1992. To generate a Hokkaido-wide population estimate, we divided these population estimates by the total river km for each sampled river segment based on our ArcGIS stream coverage. This generated an average of 2.7 adult taimen km-1 (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). This density was used to estimate spawning abundance in river basins where we lack data. We excluded those rivers whose populations have been extirpated (Kubo 1990; Harako 1991). We estimated abundance of the regional population by adding the abundance of taimen in those basins where we have quantitative data to the estimated values of abundance predicted across the rest of the range by multiplying total river km in each basin by the density estimate of 2.7 taimen km-1. This resulted in a value of 5,068 adults for the Hokkaido population (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material).  We relied on best expert judgment, and consideration of the magnitude of bycatch of taimen in the commercial salmon fishery, to gauge levels of abundance for taimen in the Russian portion of the species range. Ranges of abundance were provided for 10 rivers along the Sea of Japan coast (1-100,101-1000,1001-10000 adults per basin), and 61 rivers on Sakhalin (1-50, 51-100, 101-1000 adults per basin). Because ranges were provided in this case, we estimated densities by basin (2.9-29.6 taimen km-1, see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) using the low and high value in each abundance strata. We assumed the density range estimated for Sakhalin applied to the Kuril Islands portion of the species range. Populations in five basins on Sakhalin Island are presently considered extirpated. To arrive at a total population for each region, we summed the population estimates (both low and high values in each strata) for the rivers where we had estimates, and extrapolated abundances based on total stream km in basins where we lack data. Our estimates for total population by region are as follows: Primorye: 2,796-28,323 adults, Khabarovsk: 3,351-33,520 adults, and Sakhalin (including Kuril Islands): 1,591-12,024 (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). The historic peaks of bycatch landings in the time series (Khabarovsk at ~ 4,000 adults yr-1 and Sakhalin at ~3,000 adults yr-1, estimated by converting landed biomass to adult numbers assuming average weight of landed adult at ~ 5kg) fall within the range of abundances estimated here.",Decreasing,"Russia and Japan (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material). Current distribution of Sakhalin taimen extends from approximately 43¬∞ N to 53¬∞ N latitude and 135¬∞ W and 145¬∞ W longitude. The Sakhalin taimen is restricted to the Russian Far East region including Primorye, Khabarovsk, and Sakhalin and Kuril Islands, and in Hokkaido, Japan.  We conducted a thorough investigation of the natural range of the species through contacts with experts familiar with Sakhalin taimen distribution. We would particularly like to identify the following individuals for providing input into this process: Dr. Sergei Zolotukhin (TINRO), Dr. Anatoly Semenchenko (TINRO), Mr. Sergei Makeev (Sakhalin Wild Nature Fund), Dr. S. N. Safranov (Sakhalin State University), and Dr. Michio Fukushima (JMOE).  We relied on the stream network developed in ArcGIS based on the Digital Chart of the World, based on a resolution of 1:1,000,000 (ESRI 1992). We generated a convex polygon that contained all the rivers known to support the species currently. The estimate of area delineated by this polygon is 332,153 km¬≤, excluding marine waters greater than 1 km offshore. We estimated the area of occupancy based on the sum of the individual basin areas that support the species, and marine waters extending 1 km offshore. Our estimate for the area of occupancy is 233,498 km¬≤. We assumed in both cases that the area is continuing to decline, but the species does not exhibit extreme fluctuations.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"We feel the following measures need to be taken to stem further losses and allow recovery for the species:  1. We recommend expanding and/or modifying the network of conservation rivers designated by the government in Hokkaido to provide protection to Sakhalin taimen. The existing network was established originally for protection of commercial species (e.g. Oncorhynchus masu cherry salmon and O. keta chum salmon), and has been expanded in recent years to protect rare salmonids. However, a recent effort to identify prime habitat for Sakhalin taimen based on habitat modeling suggests the existing protected area network provides little protection for this species (Fukushima and Kameyama 2006). We strongly encourage the Hokkaido government to consider extending conservation river protection to the rivers identified by Fukushima and Kameyama (2006), particularly those in the Soya peninsula that still support healthy taimen populations.  2. We recommend new regulations on recreational fishing, particularly during the spawning season. While the species has been recognized as endangered (‚Äúred book species‚Äù) in several regions (Primorye, Sakhalin and Hokkaido), the regulations triggered by these listings are not always sufficient or properly enforced (see #3). While establishing a ban on fishing is clearly needed in some circumstances, we think establishing exemptions in certain basins would be prudent if there is sufficient evidence that the exploited populations are stable or increasing. A key virtue of these exemptions is that the presence of recreational fishers, particularly in rivers in remote regions in the Russian part of the species range, could help deter illegal fishing practices. Where recreational fishing is allowed, we feel there should be a set of regulations enforced, including explicit creel limits and gear restrictions to reduce release mortality. These fish tend to become aggregated and vulnerable to heavy fishing pressure during the spring spawning season, so we feel it is especially important to enact regulations during this critical period in their life history.  3. We recommend increased enforcement of existing fishing regulations in the Russian part of the species range. Recent observations by research scientists have revealed illegal fishing operations, and much of the take, beginning in the 1980s and continuing to present, have gone unreported. Our observations have indicated that fisheries officers that are hired to enforce existing regulations have been ineffectual, largely due to a lack of presence on the rivers, particularly during the critical spawning period. We recommend increased vigilance to enforce fishing regulations intended to protect the species.  4. We recommend investigating the role of habitat and population fragmentation, particularly in Japan. Habitat fragmentation has been most widespread in Hokkaido, and we encourage actions that reduce and minimize further habitat loss, and restore habitat where possible. We are aware of ten individual, local efforts in Hokkaido to raise awareness of lost and degraded taimen habitat (e.g., Obirame Restoration Group), but we feel much more can be done through a broader scale assessment of salmonid species diversity, threats, and cumulative aquatic habitat loss across Hokkaido. A formal investigation by key public agencies into how to better balance flood plain development with conservation of rare species is critically important. A key step has recently been taken to form the Committee of Critically Endangered Species (CCES) by the Hokkaido government, and we encourage this group to focus on habitat related issues involving conservation of Sakhalin taimen.  5. We recommend formulating and enforcing best practices for infrastructure development, particularly related to resource extractive industries. While much of the habitat for Sakhalin taimen in Russia is intact, there are a number of threats that exist. Logging, road construction and pipeline development present threats to spawning habitat, in the form of increased bank instability, leading to accelerated erosion and sedimentation. Road construction also leads to increased illegal fishing activities by providing easier access to rivers. Sound best practices (e.g., riparian buffers, pipeline river crossings, culvert designs) need to be established and enforced to reduce erosion and allow unimpeded movement of fish throughout the watershed.  6. While there has been some preliminary efforts in both Japan and Russia at captive breeding for the species, we feel these activities should proceed with great caution. Inter-basin transplants could contribute to loss of locally adapted gene complexes. We encourage basic research on the degree of geneflow that exists between river populations to understand phylogeographic patterns that could help guide future reintroductions. Although there is some evidence that captive propagation can help reduce short-term extinction risk for critically endangered species, there is virtually no empirical evidence to indicate whether propagation can promote long-term sustainability. Therefore, captive propagation efforts, to the extent that they exist, are at best stop-gap measures and are in no way a substitute for conserving the species in the wild.  7. Finally, given the myriad threats to the species, it's dramatic rate of decline, and it's cross border, limited distribution, we feel it is important to establish an intergovernmental working group to consider formally our proposed conservation actions and draft an implementation plan to conserve the species.",Palearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1

However, it is nearly extirpated in the European Black Sea basin and there are only occasional records from lower Volga. It is thought that few individuals exist in the Danube in Hungary and Serbia. Even though there is no catch data it is suspected that the species has undergone a population decline of more than 90% in the past three generations (estimated at 45 years) which is expected to continue. It is believed the species is on the verge of extinction. European Union 27 = CR A2cd. Last recorded in 2003 in Serbia at Apatin (released alive) and in 2005 in Mura in Hungary (killed) both were males. In Romania according to a fisherman survey during 1996-2001 15 specimens were caught by Romanian fishermen. The species was last scientifically recorded here in 1950s. The species is not stocked in the Danube due to the lack of spawners. Over past 3 generations (45 years) it is estimated that there has been more than a 90% decline in population. This decline is probably due to damming (Irongate Dam) which has changed river conditions and illegal harvesting. The Allee effect is possibly preventing the individuals that remain from meeting and reproducing. There is an Action Plan published by EC for the Danube (recommends fish collection and articifical propagation and release - live gene bank), but this needs full implementation. Suitable habitat does still exist for the species.","Habitat : At sea, close to shores and estuaries. In freshwater, deep stretches of large rivers. Juveniles in shallow riverine habitats. This species spawns in strong-current habitats in main courses of large and deep rivers on stone or gravel bottom.Biology: Anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed), with some non-migratory freshwater populations. Males reproduce for the first time at 6-15 years, females at 12-22, with an average generation length of 15 years (but in the Danube, the average population age has now increased and in the Caspian Sea, the average population age is decreasing because of overharvesting). In most drainages, there are two migration runs, in spring and autumn. Individuals migrating in autumn remain in the river until the following spring to spawn. Females reproduce every 2-3 and males every 1-2 years in March-May and at temperatures above 10¬∞C. Most juveniles move to sea in their first summer and remain there until maturity. Some individuals remain in freshwater for a longer period. Feeds on a wide variety of benthic fishes, molluscs and crustaceans.This species has the highest relative fecundity for any sturgeon species (Chebanov pers. comm.).","Over harvesting, bycatch and illegal fishing (poaching) along with dams, water abstraction and drought has led to the loss of spawning habitats/ground and has caused massive population declines. In the Caspian Sea and Sea of Azov the illegal sturgeon catch for all species was evaluated to be 6 to 10 times the legal catch (CITES Doc. AC.16.7.2).Transfers of A. stellatus from the Caspian Sea, carrying a nematode parasite, were introduced to the Aral sea in the late 1960s and along with increasing salinity, helped cause the extirpation of A. nudiventris in the Aral sea within a few years (Gessner, J. pers. comm.).The Allee affect is also a potential threat to the species (Gessner, J. pers comm.).Hybridisation between this species and all sturgeons and especially A. stellatus occurs in freshwater naturally (Chebanov pers.

It is now extirpated from the Aegean Sea, and in the Black Sea basin the last natural population migrates up the Danube where it is heavily overfished. Only very few spawners remain in the rest of the Black Sea basin most likely originating from stocking activities. The Caspian populations are under massive pressure from overfishing (including poaching) and loss of spawning sites and the stocks are declining very fast. Almost all migrating spawners are poached below the Volgograd dam. Overfishing in the rivers and sea will soon cause extinction of the natural populations. In the immediate future, survival of the species can only depend on stocking and effective fisheries management and combating illegal fishing. Based on catch data, and number of individuals migrating into the Volga and Ural rivers it is estimated that the species has undergone a population decline of at least 80% (possibly close to 100%) in the past three generations (minimum estimate of 30 years, possibly up to 40), which is expected to continue. Catch data shows massive declines across the species range with a 98% decline between 1980 and 2007 in the Caspian Sea, and a 72.5% in four years (2002-2005) in Romania (Danube).European Union 27 = CR A2cde.

Currently the species is only found in lower Danube below the Iron Gate II dam. There is still some natural spawning (see Juvenile Production Index in population data). Dams have impacted the species, but the major threat is overfishing (illegal and legal) within EU 27 but also when the fish migrate to the sea where they are the victim of overfishing. . After 2001, quotas have been set in Romania but they are never met due to declining fish population. In 2002 only 73% of CITES requested quota was caught, in 2003 30.7% was caught, in 2005 only 27% was caught. Therefore in 2006 all commercial fishing was banned and export ceased. Only a small number of brood fish are now caught for spawning and then released back into the wild. Stocking in the Danube only started in 2006 (all individually coded wire tagged juveniles at 15cm). There has been a decline in catch of 72.5% in 4 years (2002-2005) in Romania (Danube). Based on catch data it is estimated that there has been more than a 90% in the past 30 years (3 generations).","This species is found at sea, coastal and estuarine zones, where it forages on clayey sand bottoms, as well as intensively in middle and upper water layers. It spawns in strong-current habitats in the main course of large and deep rivers, on stone or gravel bottoms. It is also known to spawn on flooded river banks, on sand or sandy clay. Juveniles inhabit shallow riverine habitats during their first summer&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;et al. 2009). This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Caspian fish first mature at 6-7 years for males, and 7-8 years for females, with a generation length not less than 10 years. Females reproduce every 3-4 years and males every 2-3 years in April-September. It spawns only under relatively constant hydrological conditions, as fluctuating hydrological conditions lead to high egg mortality. This species migrates upriver at higher temperatures and therefore later than other sturgeons, with two peaks, in spring and in autumn. Males remain at spawning sites no longer than six weeks and females only 10-12 days. Spent individuals migrate directly back to sea. Yolk-sac larvae are pelagic for 2-3 days and drift with current. Juveniles migrate to sea during their first summer and remain there until maturity. At sea, this species feeds on a wide variety of crustaceans, molluscs and benthic as well as pelagic fish&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;et al. 2009).The main habitat in the Caspian Sea of the Stellate Sturgeon in the winter is the middle part of the sea (Legeza 1970). In the spring they migrate to the north, with its maximum density being observed off the mid-west coast in shallow water rich in food organisms (Legeza 1970). In late spring they move to the north-west coast. In autumn Stellate Sturgeons begin migrating to the south of the Caspian Sea (earlier than other species), concentrating at the mid-western coast and the south-eastern coast (Legeza 1970). The spawning migration starts in April. Spawning occurs at temperatures from 9 to 16 ¬∞C in the channel and spring flooded spawning grounds at the current speed of 0.8-1.2 m / sec. The greatest number of Stellate Sturgeon migrate to the Ural River (Peseridi et al. 1986, Dovgopol et al. 1992). Stellate Sturgeon stop eating after the beginning of the spawning migration. After spawning, they return downstream into the sea, where they begin actively feeding. The juveniles of Stellate Sturgeon also do not delay in the river and migrate for feeding into the sea.","The reason for Stellate Sturgeon abundance decrease is primarily due to marine fishing and a sharp increase of poaching, seizing the largest and mature fish and nullifying the natural reproduction of sturgeon. This also is now the most serious problem for Stellate sturgeons spawning within the EU-27. In the Caspian Sea and Sea of Azov the illegal sturgeon catch for all species was evaluated to be 6 to 10 times the legal catch (CITES 2000). Single specimens of Stellate Sturgeon were harvested at the Azerbaijan coast during a trawl survey in 1994; this is most likely due to heavy illegal fishing (large number of poaching gears were observed).Overfishing has prevented hatcheries catching enough mature individuals to maintain the necessary broodstock (Artyukhin 1997 in CITES 2000), and stocking has severely decreased in the Caspian Sea as the stocking process relies upon wild individuals (unlike other sturgeon species they are difficult to keep mature individuals in ponds, Nikolai pers. comm.). The annual release (over the past 10 years) of sturgeon juveniles from sturgeon hatcheries in Russia amounts to from 3 to 20 million specimens; in Kazakhstan - from 2.5 to 4.1 million specimens; in Azerbaijan - from 2.5 to 6.8 million specimens; in Islamic Republic of Iran - from 0.2 to 1.3 million specimens. This quantity of stocks recruitment of Stellate Sturgeon from industrial sturgeon culture is not enough to supply the population at an optimum level&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;et al. 2009). Dams have also led to the loss of many spawning grounds. For example the Volgograd dam (built in 1955) led to loss of 40% of spawning sites formally available in the Volga (Khodorevskaya et al. 2009). The species is also considered extirpated from the upper and middle Danube since the building of the Djerdap Dams (Iron Gate Dams). The Don River dam removed 68,000 ha of spawning ground and flow regulation in the Kuban led to the loss of 140,000 ha of spawning grounds.Pollution is a threat to the species. In 1990, 55,000 sturgeon were found dead on the shore of the Sea of Azov as the result of pollution.The Allee affect is also a potential threat to the species (Gessner, J. pers. comm.).Introduced Mnemiopsis (from US) which impacts the species food source (pelagic fishes) has impacted the Black Sea population (impacts now reduced in Black Sea) and is now impacting the Caspian Sea populations.Introduction of fertilized eggs (from before 1986 and again 2003/4, and it may continue) from the Caspian Sea into the Azov Sea may impact the genetic integrity of Azov Sea population (Chebanov pers. comm.).","In the early 1990s it was estimated that nearly 100% of the Sea of Azov population and 30% of the Caspian Sea population were from stocking. Recent estimations are that more than 50% of the Caspian Sea populations are from stocking (Pourkazemi pers. comm.).Global catches show that in 1992, 2,730 tonnes were caught, falling to a low of 38 tonnes in 2004, and 50 tonnes in 2007 (a decline of over 98% in 15 years). The average catch between 1992-1999 was 1,063 tonnes, and between 2000 and 2007 it was 132 tonnes, a decline of 87% (FAO 2009). The decline in commercial catch for the species is believed to reflect a decline in the species population (CITES 2000). For the whole Caspian basin, catch peaked in 1977 with 13,700 tonnes; this has shown an almost continuous decline to 305 tonnes in 2003 (most recent data) (over 97% decline in 32 years) (Pikitch et al. 2005). In 2008 the agreed catch quota for A.stellatus for all Caspian Sea countries in 2008 was set at 240 tonnes, including commercial and scientific catch; the quota has not been met (Pourkazemi pers. comm.). Khodorevskaya et al. (2009) shows that the average numbers of spawners entering the lower Volga per year has fallen from a peak of 230,000 (between 1986-90) to just 50,000 (between 1998-2002), a decline of 78%. It is expected that the decline has continued at a similar rate to the present time (though data does not exist) and will continue. In the Ural the estimated number of migrating individuals per year has also shown a decline, in 1970: 1,100,000; 1979: 1,050,000; 1990: 300,000 migrating individuals (Veschev 1995); 1998: 103,600; 2001: 87,400 (Pikitch et al. 2000). This shows a 92% decline from 1979 to 2001 (also from 1970 to 2001, as migrating individuals per year remained relatively stable between 1970 and 1979).Distribution of Stellate Sturgeon in the Caspian Sea has declined (based on CPUE distribution data) from the 1970s to 2004 (Khodorevskaya et al. 2009).In summer, Stellate Sturgeon feed in the warmer waters, forming the densest concentration, more than 0.6 specimens per 10,000 m3 in the western region of the Caspian sea; this is four times higher than was recorded in 1994 (Khodorevskaya et al. 2009). Concentration of all species of sturgeons and in particular, of Stellate Sturgeon, remains high in the area off the island of Ogurchinskii in the southern part of the Caspian Sea off the Turkmenian coast, but its abundance has declined 3.4 times compared to 1991&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;et al. 2009).The total population size in the investigated water in 2008 was between 6.7-9.5 million specimens, this has fallen from 83 million in 1988&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;et al. 2009). Massive stocking levels will also mask declines in the wild populations.Over recent decades, Stellate Sturgeon abundance in the Caspian Sea has reduced. Evidence of this is shown in the decrease of the average catch per unit effort during trawl surveys between 1978-1999. These showed a three-fold decrease in the northern Caspian Sea, a 2.7-fold decline in the middle part of the Caspian Sea and a six-fold decline off the Dagestan coast (Vlasenko et al. 2003). Decrease of CPUE has been more apparent in the southern part of the sea. The Stellate Sturgeon population has declined from 69.7 million specimens in 1978 to 15.6 million in 2002, and 7.6 million specimens in 2008. Commercial stock decreased by 12 times during this period&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;et al. 2009).In the Black Sea, in Romania, from 2002-2005 the catches of wild individuals (stocking only started in 2006 in the Danube) dropped from 12.427 tonnes to 3.43 tonnes (72.5% in 4 years); in 2006 commercial catch was stopped. The Juvenile Production Index for this species (JPI = number of young of the year (number of &gt;1 years olds caught) from natural recruitment at Danube River Km 118) shows that there is still some recruitment as in 2000 the CPUE was 1.4, 2001 0.2, 2002-4 &lt;0.2, 2005 1.3, 2006-7 0 and 2008 &gt;0.4. In Azov Sea, no mature females have been caught [for a stocking programme] since 2004 (Chebanov pers. comm.).",Decreasing,"Stellate sturgeon inhabits in the Caspian, Black and Azov Seas, and rarely in the north-eastern Aegan Sea. The Volga, Ural, Terek, Sulak, Kura, Don, Danube, Kuban Rivers are the major spawning rivers. The length of the spawning migration route of the Volga to the cascade of dams is up to Rybinsk, in the Ural - to Uralsk, in the Don - to Pavlovsk, in the Kuban - to Armavir. The highest abundance and biomass of natural population remained in the Caspian Sea. The feeding area in the Caspian Sea of Stellate Sturgeon extended from the shallow water area of the northern part of the sea to the Iranian coast. An intensive migration of Stellate Sturgeon began in spring (March-May) to the shallow water area, in the Northern Caspian where the largest concentrations of fish were observed at the western coast of this part of the sea, as well as in the pre-mouth areas in the eastern part of the Volga River Delta (Belinskii and Igolkinskii Banks&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;et al. 2009)).","Skin and as a leather.

However, although aquaculture contributes considerably to the maintenance of the stocks, it cannot compensate for the damage caused to natural reproduction by overfishing (CITES 2000). It is not fully protected in any range state apart from Moldova. A license is required for fishing in most countries and private sturgeon fisheries are banned in Iran. This species was listed on CITES Appendix II in 1998.According to 2007 Caspian Sea Bioresource Commission, 8.1 million fingerlings of A. stellatus were released into Caspian Sea by Khazakstan, Iran and Azerbaijan. Russia released 45 million (all sturgeon species) in 2007, but not specified how many were A. stellatus - but this is not less than 12 million (Ruban pers. comm.). To preserve the commercial importance of Stellate Sturgeon population it is necessary to protect the recruitment from natural spawning and increase the industrial sturgeon aquaculture. Considering the state of stocks of the Caspian Sea it is necessary for all Caspian Sea states to suspend its harvest for commercial purposes (in Russia, the ban on Stellate Sturgeon commercial harvesting has been introduced since 2005).

The Caspian basin has lost 70% of spawning grounds since the 1950s mainly due to hydroelectric power stations; flow regulation of the Kuban has led to the loss of 140,000 ha and damming of the river Don removed 68,000 ha spawning ground (CITES 2000).The last natural population in the Black Sea basin still migrates up the Danube and maybe the Rioni (last recorded in Rioni in 1999), where the sturgeons are heavily overfished and poached. Danubian sturgeons are also the victim of overfishing in the Black Sea were considerable amounts are taken, especially along the Turkish coast. The Caspian populations are also under massive pressure from overfishing and loss of spawning habitats. Almost all migrating spawners are poached below the Volgograd dam. The Ural river still has spawning individuals.It is estimated that the species' wild native population has undergone a massive population decline of over 90% in the past three generations (estimated at 45 years). This is based on the 88.5% decline in global catches of the species in just 15 years despite large levels of stocking (average global catch from 1992-1999 was 1,531.75 tonnes; from 2000-2007 it was 175.37 tonnes), the 92.5% decline in estimated spawning stock biomass in the Volga from 1961-65 to 1998-2000, the 88% decline in the average number of spawners entering the lower Volga from the 1962-75 average to the 1992-2002 average, and the decline in the Juvenile Production Index from Romanian Danube. It must be noted, that it is unclear which part of the 20th and 21th century catches are result from natural or artificial reproduction as massive stocking masks the decline of natural spawnings. This decline is predicted to continue as illegal fishing at sea, and in rivers, for caviar will soon result in the extinction of the remaining natural wild population. In the immediate future, survival can only depend on stocking.EU 27 - CR A2bcde. Just found within the Danube, and Black Sea. Very rare in Black Sea basin where almost all of the species spawning sites have been lost due to dam construction, except in the lower Danube river where spawning still exists but is declining and individuals are rare, catches have also drastically declined in recent years (see Romanian catch data and juvenile spawning data in population field). It is estimated that there has been&#160; &gt;90% decline in the past 3 generations (45 years). Remaining spawning grounds that exist in the Danube are more than 10km2.","Habitat: At sea, shallow coastal and estuarine zones. In freshwaters, in deep parts of large rivers with moderate to swift current. Spawns in strong current (1-1.5 m/s) in large and deep rivers on stone or gravel bottom. Biology: Anadromous and freshwater populations (freshwater populations existed in the Danube and Volga - both are now extinct). A complicated pattern of spawning migrations includes spring and autumn runs. Individuals migrating in spring enter freshwater just before spawning; they tend to spawn in lower reaches of rivers (320-650 km in the unregulated Ural). Individuals migrating in autumn overwinter in rivers and spawn the following spring further upstream (900-1200 km in the Ural). Males reproduce for the first time at 8-13 years, females at 10-16. Generation length (average age of parents of current cohort) is estimated to be 15 years under natural circumstances, but due to the impacts this species is facing the generation length ranges from between 12 years in the Caspian Sea to over 20 in the Danube. Females reproduce every 4-6 years and males every 2-3 years in April-June, when the temperature rises above 10¬∞C. Larvae drift on currents; juveniles then move towards shallower habitats, before migrating to the sea during their first summer. They remain at sea until maturity. The Russian Sturgeon feeds on a wide variety of benthic molluscs, crustaceans and small fish.","Most spawning sites have been lost due to dam construction. The Caspian basin lost 70% of spawning grounds since the 1950s, mainly due to the construction of hydroelectric power stations; the Ural is now the only river in the basin with unregulated flow. Flow regulation of the Kuban River has led to the loss of 140,000 ha, and damming of the river Don has removed 68,000 ha spawning ground. For example, in the Yugoslavian section of the Danube, the annual catch dropped from 14,636 kg in 1983 to 1,636 kg in 1985 (a decline of just under 90%), this is believed to be due to the construction of the Djerdap (Irongate) II dam which was constructed in 1984, leaving no accessible spawning grounds for the species in the upstream reaches and in former Yugoslavia (CITES 2000).Poaching and illegal fishing, which appears to be increasing, is also a threat to the species. Enforcement of legislation regulating the fishery for the species appear to be lacking. In the Caspian Sea and Sea of Azov the illegal sturgeon catch for all species was evaluated to be 6 to 10 times the legal catch (CITES 2000). Bycatch is also a threat to the species (in both marine and freshwater).High levels of pollution (from oil and industrial waste), in both the Black and Caspian Sea basins have altered hormonal balance, and increased the number of hermaphroditic fish. Pollution levels are now decreasing since the break up of the Soviet Union (Levin, 1977 in CITES 2000). In 1990, 55,000 sturgeon were found dead on the shore of the Sea of Azov as the result of pollution.Genetic pollution is also a potential threat as stocks are moved to different locations (e.g. Caspian stocks moved to Sea of Azov).The Allee affect is also a potential threat to the species.","The species wild native population has undergone major decline which is currently occurring. But due to the large levels of stocking (particularly Russia and Iran) the exact levels are unknown. According to CITES (2000) Russia released 25 million fingerlings into the Vologa between 1979-80, 35 million between 1981-85, 40.8 million between 1986-90, 42 million between 1991-95 and 28 million 1996-98; Iran released 300,000 fingerlings in 1994 which has risen nearly every year to 960,000 in 1999.Despite this level of stocking, fisheries catches have fallen, particularly from the early 1990s in the Caspian. According to FAO fisheries statistics (FAO 2009) global catches fell from 4,250 tonnes in 1992 (first available catch data) to 67 tonnes in 2007 (last available catch data), a decline of 98% in 15 years. The average catch from 1992-1999 (8 year period) was 1,531.75 tonnes, whereas the average catch from 2000-2007 (8 year period) was 175.37 tonnes, a decline of 88.5%.Data from the Caspian Sea (Khodorevskaya et al. 2009) shows similar declines: catches were between 6,000 and 9,000 tonnes per year in the 1960s to a peak of around 14,500 tonnes in the late 1970s early 1980s to less than 1,000 per year from 2000 to 2008. The estimated spawning stock biomass in the Volga has also drastically declined, from 13,200 tonnes (1961-65) and 22,200 tonnes (1966-70) to 1,000 tonnes (1996-97) and 1,000 tonnes (1998-2002). Average number of spawners (1,000 individuals) passing fishery zones to the spawning grounds in the lower Volga (per year) has declined by 88% from the 1962-75 average to the 1992-2002 average.Romanian catch data (Danube) shows that in 2002, 3,726 kg was caught; in 2003, 1,499 kg; in 2004, 440 kg; and in 2005, 37 kg, showing a 99% decline in just four years (Paraschiv et al. 2006). A Juvenile Production Index (evidence of breeding) for the Danube (Romania) also shows a decline: CPUE was just over 0.7 in 2000, &lt; 0.2 in 2001, 0.3 in 2002, 0 in 2003, &lt; 0.1 in 2004, 0.1 in 2005, 0 in 2006, &lt; 0.05 in 2007 and 0 in 2008.

There are only occasional records from the northern Caspian basin (in 2008, 100 immature individuals were caught in the northern Caspian basin (Mugue pers. comm.)).

Age range for mature females is 6-40 years; 85% are between 14-18 years, and 80% of males are between 12-16yrs (Moghim 2003). Average generation length is 14 years. This species does not spawn every year. Spawning takes place in June-August when temperature rises above 16¬∞C. In the southern Caspian basin, the Persian Sturgeon spawns in April-September but reproduction is interrupted from June to August when temperature rises above 25¬∞C. Most individuals migrate upriver in April-May, but some may enter rivers at other times of the year. In the southern Caspian basin, there is a second run in September-October. Juveniles migrate to the sea during their first summer and remain there until maturity. At sea, the Persian Sturgeon feeds on a wide variety of benthic molluscs, crustaceans and small fish.This species has different ecological biological requirements to A. gueldenstaedtii, as it prefers warmer water for spawning and has a shorter migration run.","Dams across the region have led to the blocking of access to almost all spawning grounds. Illegal fishing/poaching across the Caspian region is the principle threat. In the Caspian Sea, the illegal sturgeon catch for all species was evaluated to be 6 to 10 times the legal catch (CITES 2000). Bycatch is also a threat to the species in both rivers and the Caspian Sea. In 1996, fish inspection authorities filed 8,000 citations for violations committed by individuals, mainly in the Astrakhan region along the Volga (Vecsei and Artyukhin 2001).In Iran, pollution from agriculture and domestic waste causes loss and degradation of spawning sites. In Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, oil and industrial pollution has led to the loss of suitable feeding grounds. In Russia, oil pollution is a potential threat.The Allee affect is also a potential threat to the species.The lack of ability to genetically identify the species in international trade is a potential threat, as Russian and Persian Sturgeon (caviar) can be mixed.","The only legal commercial exploitation of this species is in Iran (mainly from hatchery stock). Restocking in Iran started in 1969.

724,North Asia,Lamna nasus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,LAMNIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,LAMNIDAE,Lamna,nasus,A2bd,"European regional assessment: Critically Endangered (CR)Porbeagle (Lamna nasus) is a wide-ranging coastal and oceanic shark. This species is highly vulnerable to overexploitation and population depletion due to low reproductive capacity and high commercial value (in target and incidental fisheries) of mature and immature age classes makes. The Northeast Atlantic subpopulation collapsed following serious overexploitation by directed longline fisheries; it was then subject to unrestricted fishing pressure following the crash. Data are lacking for the Northeast Atlantic subpopulation, but subpopulation reduction is considered to be much greater than in the Northwest Atlantic, for which more data are available. It is suspected that the Northeast Atlantic subpopulation declined by ‚â• 80% given that the less exploited Northwest Atlantic population declined to between 11 and 17% of virgin biomass. Abundance levels of this species have historically been low throughout the Mediterranean Sea. The increase in fishing effort over the last 60 years has now driven the species to local extinction in most regions of the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in the west. There are no signs of decreasing fishing effort or improved fisheries regulation in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, the species is suspected to have undergone a decline of at least 80% over three generations (75 years) in European waters, and it is thus assessed as Critically Endangered under criteria A2bd.","Porbeagle is a wide-ranging coastal and oceanic species, more commonly found on continental shelves, in temperate and cold-temperate waters worldwide (one to 18¬∞C, zero to 1360 m; Compagno 2001).  In the Northwest Atlantic, this species reaches a maximum reported size of 253 and 302 cm fork length (FL) in males and females, respectively (Francis et al. 2008). Males in the north Atlantic mature at about 166 cm FL while females mature at 208 cm FL (Francis et al. 2008). Though data on the Northeast Atlantic population are sparse, it is estimated that males and females do not mature until they are 1.7 and 2.0 m FL, respectively. These lengths correspond to an estimated age-at-maturity of seven to eight years for males and approximately 20 years for females (Hennache and Jung 2010). Natanson et al. (2002) and Campana et al. (2002) reported a maximum age of 26 years for the Northwest Atlantic population. However, the estimated longevity might be as high as 46 years in an unfished population. Ages at 50% maturity for north Atlantic males and females are eight and 13 years respectively (Jensen et al. 2002). The generation length of this species is estimated to be around 25 years. This shark is live bearing with oophagy and litters between one and five pups (average four), which are 68 to 78 cm total length (TL) at birth (Compagno 1984, Gauld 1989, Francis and Stevens 2000, DFO 2001, Francis et al. 2008). Aasen (1963) estimated that the gestation period was about eight months in the north Atlantic and that individual females breed each year. However, Shann (1923) found two distinct size groups of embryos present in the December to February period and suggested that gestation may last 18 to 24 months. Gauld (1989) noted that a resting period might exist between parturition and fertilisation. Francis and Stevens (2000), Jensen et al. (2002) and Francis et al. (2008) estimate an eight to nine month gestation period. Birth occurs in spring off Europe (Aasen 1963).  Recent records indicate a possible nursery area in the southern and central Adriatic Sea (Soldo 2007); newborns were caught in the central Adriatic Sea (Marconi and De Maddalena 2001, Orsi Relini and Garibaldi 2002) and the western Ligurian Sea (Orsi Relini and Garibaldi 2002).","Northeast Atlantic The Northeast Atlantic fishery began when Norway started targeting Porbeagle in the 1930s using longlines. The collapse of this fishery in the 1960s led to the redirection of fishing effort by Norwegian and Danish longline shark fishing vessels into the Northwest Atlantic. French and Spanish longliners operated directed fisheries for Porbeagle from the 1970s through to the end of the 20th century, and these countries have reported the bulk of landings in the Northeast Atlantic since this time. Smaller amounts have also been landed by the UK, Faroes, Norway, Ireland, Denmark and Germany.  The main countries catching this species since the early 2000s were France, Spain, the UK and Norway. The only regular, directed target fishery that has existed recently was the French fishery (although there have been occasional target fisheries in the UK). Furthermore, the species is taken as a bycatch in mixed fisheries, mainly in the UK, Ireland, France and Spain (ICES 2013). It is thought that the 2010 and 2011 data for the Northeast Atlantic are underestimates, due to misreporting. All data since 2010 must be considered as unrepresentative of removals, as dead discards are not quantified. Mediterranean Sea This species has practically disappeared from the Mediterranean Sea as a result of intensive fishing effort over the past 60 or so years. In particular, this shark is vulnerable to exploitation by large pelagic fisheries such as driftnets and longlines. Even though driftnetting has been banned throughout the Mediterranean Sea, there are still illegal driftnet fisheries in operation. It is also a popular recreational species in big game fisheries in some areas of the Mediterranean Sea.&#160;","In the north Atlantic, this shark is considered to comprise two distinct subpopulations: the Northwest Atlantic and Northeast Atlantic subpopulations. This subdivision was originally based on a relatively small number of tag returns from conventional tagging studies in the north Atlantic (Stevens 1990, DFO 1999, Kohler et al. 2002). Tagging studies from Norway, the USA and Canada resulted in 542, 1,034 and 256 individuals being tagged, respectively. A total of 197 recaptures were made (53 from Norwegian, 119 from USA and 25 from Canadian studies), and initial studies did not report transatlantic migrations (Campana et al. 2003). These tags only provide information on tag and re-capture location; movements in between these times are unknown. One transatlantic migration has since been reported (see Francis et al. 2008), implying at least limited connectivity between the two north Atlantic subpopulations.  The potential for long-distance movement has been reported from pop-up satellite archival tag (PAT) and Smart Position and Temperature (SPOT) tag-based projects in Ireland, the UK and France, which have uncovered large-scale movements of Porbeagles along the Northeast Atlantic continental shelf from Norway to northwest Africa, and offshore halfway across the Atlantic (Pade et al. 2009, Saunders et al. 2011, Bendall et al. 2012). In the Northwest Atlantic, extensive PAT tagging has also shown many long-distance movements to the east and south, but none as far as the mid-Atlantic ridge (Campana et al. 2010). Two Porbeagles tagged in Ireland in 2012 and 2013 with PSAT and Argos-transmitter tags, respectively, spent a significant amount of time travelling along the mid-Atlantic ridge (Bendall et al. 2012).  Within the Northeast Atlantic, individuals tagged off southern England with conventional tags have been recaptured off Spain, Denmark and Norway (2,370 km away), and an individual tagged in Ireland travelled 4,260 km (Kohler and Turner 2001), suggesting mixing throughout their range in the Northeast Atlantic (Stevens 1976, 1990). Genetic evidence indicates that gene flow must have occurred across the north Atlantic at some time in the past, although when it happened is unknown (Pade et al. 2009). There is no evidence of genetic exchange between the north Atlantic and southern hemisphere populations, and no evidence of mixing between the Mediterranean Sea and Northeast Atlantic stocks (ICES 2008). Northeast Atlantic Reported landings decreased from 1,755 tonnes (t) in 1972 to around 800 t by the end of the decade. In the 1980s, landings slowly decreased further to around 400 t by the end of the decade. In the 1990s there was a slight increase in landings, reaching a peak in 1994 (1,047 t) before decreasing back to around 500 t by the turn of the century. Since the year 2000 landings have decreased to 98 t by 2010, as a result of reductions in quotas.  It is unclear whether the very variable early landings data from the Spanish fleet (from zero to nearly 4,000 t per year) represent huge variations in catches, possibly the result of ‚Äúboom and bust‚Äù fisheries removing different segments of the stock, or differences in catch reporting. Bonfil (1994) estimated that 50 t of Porbeagle were taken as a supplementary catch in the Spanish longline swordfish fishery in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic during 1989. The longline fishery in the Bay of Biscay (ICES Area VIII), directed at the more abundant Blue Shark (Prionace glauca), also landed about 30 t of mainly Porbeagle and some Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) during 1998 to 2000.   Heessen (2003) indicates that annual landings from Area IXa (Portuguese coast) into mainland Portugal peaked at almost 3,000 t in 1987 to 1988 and have since declined (these records do not appear in the FAO statistics). The Northeast Atlantic stock has the longest history of commercial exploitation. The lack of catch per unit effort data for the peak of the fishery adds considerable uncertainty in identifying the current status relative to virgin biomass. Exploratory stock assessments carried out in 2009 by the joint International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT)/International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) meeting using a Bayesian Surplus Production (BSP) model and an age-structured production (ASP) model indicated that biomass was below biomass maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and that recent fishing mortality was near or possibly above fishing mortality maximum sustainable yield (FMSY) (Babcock and Cort√©s 2009, ICCAT 2010). ICES considered the stock to be depleted, especially in the northern parts of the ICES area (ICCAT 2010). The BSP model projections indicate that sustained reductions in fishing mortality would be required if there is to be any stock recovery. Recovery of this stock to BMSY under zero fishing mortality would take ~15‚Äì34 years. Mediterranean Sea Declines in abundance and distribution have been reported in the Mediterranean Sea (Ferretti et al. 2008). Historical abundance levels are unknown but suspected to have been low. This species has virtually disappeared from Mediterranean records, and is thought to be completely absent from the western region (Soldo et al. 2014). In the north Tyrrhenian and Ligurian Seas, only 15 specimens were reported during a few decades of observation (Serena and Vacchi 1997). Only nine individuals were caught by the small-scale multigear fleet in the eastern Adriatic Sea between the late 19th century until 2000, although occasional catches continue to be recorded (Soldo and Jardas 2002). During research on bycatch of the western Mediterranean Swordfish longline fishery, no Porbeagles were caught (De la Serna et al. 2002). Only 15 specimens were caught during research conducted in 1998-1999 on bycatch of sharks in large pelagic fisheries, and these catches were reported only in the southern Adriatic Sea and Ionian Sea, mainly by driftnets (Megalofonou et al. 2000). Official catch statistics for the Mediterranean Sea show that the only landings were reported in 1996 by Malta and amounted to one tonne (FAO 2002).The species is suspected to have undergone a decline of at least 80% over the three-generation period (75 years) in European waters.",Decreasing,"In the Northeast Atlantic Porbeagle (Lamna nasus) occurs off Greenland, Iceland, Norway, the British Isles, Sweden, Germany, France, south to Spain, Portugal (including the Azores) and Morocco. It was also present historically throughout in the Mediterranean Sea (Ebert and Stehmann 2013), but it is no longer clear what extent of the Mediterranean Sea this species inhabits; indeed, it is thought to have disappeared from the western region at the very least (Soldo et al. 2014). Its depth range is zero to 1,360 m.",There is a targeted fishery for this species.,Marine,"The first European Union (EU) total allowable catch (TAC) for Northeast Atlantic Porbeagle was set at 581 t and took effect in 2008, two years after ICES advised ending fishing for this species. The EU Fisheries Council then reduced the 2008 TAC by 25% in 2009. In 2010, it was further reduced to zero and EU vessels were prohibited from taking the species from international waters. In 2011, Porbeagle measures were extended to all EU waters, including the Mediterranean Sea. The EU Porbeagle TAC remained at zero for 2011-2014. Porbeagle has specific, national legal protection in Sweden and Croatia where it is a prohibited species.  In 2007 Norway banned all direct fisheries for Porbeagle, based on the ICES advice. From 2007‚Äì2011, specimens taken as bycatch could be landed and sold. Since 2011, live specimens must be released, whereas dead specimens can be landed (but this is not mandatory). The number of specimens landed must be reported in addition to weight. However, since 2012, landings of Porbeagle are not remunerated. From 2011, the regulations also include recreational fishing (ICES 2013). Efforts by the EU to secure prohibition of retention of this species through ICCAT have been unsuccessful to date. The North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission has banned targeted Porbeagle fisheries. Although plans for implementation are not yet evident two years later,&#160;Parties to the Barcelona Convention agreed in 2012 that&#160;elasmobranch&#160;species listed in Annex II of the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean&#160;-- which includes Porbeagle -- cannot be retained on board, transshipped, landed, transferred, stored, sold or displayed, or offered for sale, and must be released unharmed and alive, to the extent possible. Porbeagle was listed in 2008 under Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which directs countries to collaborate to conserve shared populations. The species is also covered under the 2010 CMS Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for Migratory Sharks since 2010, and an accompanying Conservation Plan for MoU listed sharks established in 2012, but no species-specific, regional plans or measures have resulted from this listing to date.&#160; Porbeagle was listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in 2013.&#160;This requires international trade to be monitored and derived from sustainably managed fisheries, beginning in September 2014.&#160; In 2013, the EU banned the removal of shark fins on board vessels through Regulation No. 605/2013, in line with advice from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission‚Äôs Shark Specialist Group and other shark fishery experts, in order to enhance enforcement of the EU ban on shark finning from 2003 (Regulation No. 1185/2003) and facilitate improved shark fishery data collection.  The European Commission banned the deliberate use of bottom-set nets to catch certain teleost (bony fish) and shark species ‚Äì including Porbeagle ‚Äì that are particularly sensitive to overexploitation from this fishing method (EC Regulation No. 1967/2006). By way of derogation, accidental bycatch of no more than three specimens of the shark species protected by this measure may be retained on board or landed, provided that they are not a protected species under Community law.&#160;",Palearctic,,False,False,Europe,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

These plants provide resources for both nectar and pollen.","Habitat change, changing farming practices (removing its main food plant Trifolium from rotations), reafforestation of grasslands and even urbanization have reduced the area of suitable habitat available. In addition, climate change, especially the increasing frequency of heat waves, is believed likely to have caused local population collapses (Rasmont and Iserbyt 2012).The tongue length is very similar to that of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) and competition between this species and Apis is believed likely to have caused declines in Sweden.","This is historically an uncommon species over much of its range. The western European populations have declined to the verge of extinction and now remain as&#160;a single isolated subpopulation in northern Spain (Williams et al. 2012).&#160;There was evidence of strong declines after the heat wave in 2003 and the following drought in 2004-2007; field observations revealed that the species was missing from many localities where it occurred ten years previously (P.

It returns to its breeding grounds between January and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and breeding occurs April to July. Birds time their arrival for spring and the start of breeding is highly dependent on availability of its chief prey species. The nest is constructed of sticks with the nest cup lined with smaller twigs and many other materials, such as old rags, bones, moulted feathers and camel dung. Nests have traditionally been built as large platforms on the ground, although recent habitat alterations seem to have caused a shift to building a few metres higher in bushes or trees. It feeds mainly on small mammals on its breeding grounds, with susliks forming the vast majority of its diet in some areas (Meyburg and Boesman 2013). When susliks are scarce they will feed on middle-sized mammals or dead saiga antelope (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is migratory, with birds wintering in south-east Africa and southern Asia (Meyburg and Boesman 2013).","The species has declined in the west of its breeding range, including extirpation from Romania, Moldova and Ukraine, as a result of the conversion of steppes to agricultural land combined with direct persecution (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Boesman 2013).

It favours scattered shrubby vegetation, typically comprising xerophytic or halophytic plants (del Hoyo et al. 2014). On the breeding grounds, nesting females may also favour sites away from vegetation patches, which could provide cover for predators (Yang et al. 2003, Aghanajafizadeh et al. 2012).Outside of Europe, in Syria, the species breeds mainly from March to May (del Hoyo et al. 2014). Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher et al. 1996). Females create a shallow scrape in the ground in which they typically lay two to three eggs (del Hoyo et al. 2014). The species feeds throughout the day, but is most active at dawn and dusk (Combreau and Launay 1996). It has an eclectic diet, mainly comprising plants and invertebrates (especially ants Formicidae and beetles Tenebrionidae (Tigar and Osborne 2000)), but also including vertebrates such as rodents, lizards, small snakes and even young birds (del Hoyo et al. 2014, Tourenq et al. 2003).","The principal threat is from hunting (primarily using falconry), largely but not exclusively on the species's wintering grounds (Judas et al. 2009). In parts of the region, fast-paced development related to the growth of the petroleum industry has reduced the availability of undisturbed habitats and further exacerbated the species's decline. Oil exploration, road building, oil and water pipelines, mining and quarrying activities, powerlines and the general disturbance caused by four-wheel drive vehicles have all been identified as significant auxiliary threats. Powerlines in particular may prove to be a major threat in the near future. Livestock grazing is reported to have a negative impact on the species, both indirectly, by degrading the desert vegetation on which birds rely for food and concealment, and directly, through the trampling of nests and disturbance of nesting females (Lavee 1988).","The European population is estimated at 0-10 mature individuals.

It feeds on carrion, both putrid and fresh. While feeding considerable aggregations can form, and regular communal roost sites are used. It is social and usually found in conspecific flocks. It breeds in colonies in tall trees (e.g. in Himanchal Pradesh it is restricted to pine forest/plantations [Thakur 2015, M. Thakur in litt. 2016]), often near human habitation. Movements are poorly known, although satellite-tagged birds have shown that they will forage over a vast range. The degree of connectivity of apparently separate populations is not known. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, as they were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in South Asia. ","By mid-2000, Gyps vultures were being found dead and dying in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported&#160;(Prakash et al. 2003, 2007, Gilbert et al. 2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality.&#160;Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that had been treated prior to death (often as part of palliative care) and left for scavengers to consume. Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs which then cause&#160;renal failure resulting in visceral gout in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks et al. 2004a, Shultz et al. 2004, Green et al. 2004,&#160;Swan et al. 2006b, Gilbert et al. 2006, Cuthbert et al. 2014). Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in Gyps vultures, just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (Green et al. 2004);&#160;and sampling carcasses of livestock in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart et al. 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality and diclofenac being banned in several range states, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Paudel 2008), potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam,&#160;an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region&#160;(Swan et al. 2006a, Swarup et al. 2007).&#160;Additionally, large vials of diclofenac continue to be manufactured for human use, which are then distributed, sold and used for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert et al. 2011, T. Galligan in litt. 2016).&#160;A second veterinary drug in use in India and particularly in Bangladesh, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo et al. 2010). Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan&#160;et al.&#160;2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert&#160;et al.&#160;2016). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden in litt. 2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert et al. 2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden in litt. 2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla et al. 2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan in litt. 2016). One study recorded that the sex of fledglings, the sex of dead adults and the sex of adults with visceral gout were all male-biased which may lead to problems in the future (Arshad&#160;et al.&#160;2009).Other likely contributory factors in South Asia are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers) and poison and pesticide use, but these are probably of more minor significance (C. Bowden in litt. 2016). Forest fires may also be a threat in some areas, for instance in the Himalayas, though this may need further study (M. Thakur in litt. 2016). In Bangladesh, 61% of cattle owners surveyed said that they now buried dead cattle or used them as food in shrimp farms, which could lead to a reduction in food supply for vultures (Khan 2013).&#160;In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably resulted from the collapse of large wild ungulate populations and improved management of deceased livestock reducing food availability (Clements et al. 2013). In Cambodia, vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides to kill stray dogs and for hunting wildlife (Clements et al. 2013, S. Mahood in litt. 2012). Additional threats identified in Myanmar include direct persecution of the species through nest destruction, hunting and poisoning and indirectly through a loss of food supply (Hla et al. 2011).","Formerly described as possibly the most abundant large bird of prey in the world, this species global population almost certainly numbered several million individuals. However, following dramatic declines through the 1990s across its range its global population is now estimated to fall within the band 2,500-9,999 mature individuals. This equates to 3,750-14,999 individuals, rounded here to 3,500-15,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"Gyps bengalensis occurs in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and southern Vietnam, and may be extinct in southern China and Malaysia (BirdLife International 2001). It has been recorded from south-east Afghanistan and Iran where its status is currently unknown. As recently as 1985 the species was described as ""possibly the most abundant large bird of prey in the world"" (Houston 1985). However, it disappeared from most of South-East Asia in the early 20th century and the only viable populations in the region are found in Myanmar and Cambodia, mainly in the north (both probably in the low hundreds of individuals) (Hla 2003, Anon 2003, 2005, Eames 2007a,b, Hance 2009). Given the lack of intensive agriculture and associated chemical use in South-East Asia and the continued presence of large areas of suitable habitat for the species, the primary reason behind its decline in this part of its range is thought to be the demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (Anon 2003, 2005),&#160;as well as the impact of poisoning events as an accidental consequence of local hunting and fishing practises (Clements et al. 2013).Since the mid-1990s, it has suffered a catastrophic decline (over 99%) across the Indian Subcontinent (the majority of its historic range), first noticed&#160;by villagers in northern India in 1996-97 (A. Rahmani in litt. 2016), with further early evidence from&#160;Keoladeo National Park, India, and then throughout India (Prakash et al. 2003, 2007), Pakistan (Gilbert et al. 2006),&#160;Nepal (Baral et al. 2005, Chaudhary et al. 2012) and Bangladesh (Khan 2013), to the point that the species is highly threatened with extinction. Extensive research has identified the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac, to be the cause behind this rapid population collapse (Green et al. 2004, Oaks et al. 2004a, Shultz et al. 2004). This drug, used to treat domestic livestock, is ingested by vultures feeding on their carcasses leading to renal failure and causing visceral gout (Oaks et al. 2004a, 2004b; Swan et al. 2006b, Gilbert et al. 2006). Declines in India between 2000 and 2007 averaged 43.9% per year (Prakash et al. 2007), and ranged between 11%-61% in Punjab province, Pakistan over the same period (Murn et al. 2008), while surveys of 23 known colonies in Punjab province in 2006 found a total of only 37 breeding pairs (Murn et al. 2008). In the lowland districts of Nepal the species declined at 14% a year between 2002 and 2011 (Chaudhary et al. 2012). In Bangladesh, the species declined by 60% between 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 (Khan 2013), and the population trend in the country is still a decline (IUCN-Bangladesh 2016).&#160;The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan banned veterinary diclofenac in 2006 and the Government of Bangladesh followed suit in 2010 (T. Galligan in litt. 2016). Since then, the rate of decline appears to have slowed, and may even have reversed in India and Nepal (Prakash et al. 2012). Diclofenac is apparently entirely absent in Cambodia, adding greater importance to that remaining small population (minimum 201 individuals in 2010; 183 individuals in 2011 [Clements et al. 2013]). Census results from Cambodia suggest the population there may have been increasing since 2004, or is at least stable (Eames 2007b, Clements et al. 2013, S. Mahood in litt. 2012), while there may be some local increases in India (D. L. Bohra in litt. 2016). A local increase has also been noted in Pakistan, though this may be more a result of immigration (Murn et al. 2014). Surveys of vulture restaurants in Myanmar in 2006 and 2007 estimated a minimum of 62 White-rumped Vultures were present (Hla&#160;et al. 2011).&#160;",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. It has been reported from many protected areas across its range. The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan passed legislation in 2006 banning the manufacture and importation of diclofenac as a veterinary drug, with India passing further legislation in 2008 banning the manufacture, sale, distribution or use of veterinary diclofenac. In the same year, the Indian government ordered a crackdown on companies selling diclofenac. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use' (BirdLife International 2008). In October 2010, the government of Bangladesh banned the production of diclofenac for use in cattle, and the distribution and sale of the drug were due to be outlawed during the first half of 2011 (M.M.H. Khan in litt. 2010). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert et al. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008). The availability of diclofenac in veterinary drug stores in Bangladesh decreased from 100% in 2008-2009 to 53% in 2011-2012 (Khan 2013). However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert et al. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, and this is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan in litt. 2016). Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert et al. 2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on Gyps vultures with no ill-effects (Swan et al. 2006a, Swarup et al. 2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert&#160;et al.&#160;2016).SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km2) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs, such as ketoprofen (banned in&#160;Coimbatore, Erode and Nilgiris&#160;Districts [Venkitachalam and Senthilnathan 2016])&#160;(Galligan 2013, Mukherjee et al. 2014). There are currently multiple Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee et al. 2014, SAVE 2015). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden et al. 2012), as well as supporting wild birds (R. Cuthbert in litt. 2016). They can also bring in vulture-related income for locals, through ecotourism (T. Galligan in litt. 2016).Vulture restaurants are increasingly used as ecotourism attractions in parts of the species's range, particularly Cambodia and Nepal, to raise awareness and fund supplementary feeding programmes and research (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, A. Rahmani in litt. 2016). The exchange of diclofenac with meloxicam near breeding colonies is taking place in Nepal in combination with diversionary feeding with diclofenac-free carcasses (Chaudhary et al. 2010). Diversionary feeding has been shown to reduce but not eliminate vulture mortality from diclofenac poisoning, and uncertainty over the movements of Asian Gyps vultures makes the effectiveness of measures such as these uncertain (Pain et al. 2008). Birds have been satellite tagged in various parts of their range to improve understanding of their movements, foraging range, site fidelity etc., and to aid the development of suitable conservation strategies for the species (Ellis 2004). Socioeconomic surveys in Nepal have shown that local people are strongly in favour of vulture conservation because of the associated ecological services that vultures provide (Gautam and Baral 2003). The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres, each capable of holding 25 pairs (Bombay Natural History Society 2004). Captive breeding efforts are on-going and met with success when two chicks hatched in early 2007 at a breeding centre in Pinjore, Haryana (V. Prakash in litt. 2007, Bowden 2009). Three more birds hatched in 2009 (Bowden 2009). The centre is part of a captive breeding programme established by the RSPB and Bombay Natural History Society. A website has been set up to allow researchers to contribute data on known colonies to identify founder individuals for captive flocks that will ensure the full geographical spread of the species is represented in captive breeding efforts (M. Gilbert in litt. 2004). By April 2008, there were 88 in captivity at three breeding centres in India, as well as 11 at a centre established by WWF-Pakistan and 14 in captivity in Nepal (Pain et al. 2008). During 2009, these numbers increased to 120 in India, 43 in Nepal and 14 in Pakistan (Bowden 2009). In late 2009, trials of artificial incubation methods were due to start soon (Bowden 2009). By November 2015, the total number held in breeding centres affiliated to SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) stood at 218 birds at 3 centres in India, 15 at a centre in Pakistan and 57 at a centre in Nepal (SAVE 2015), of which 20 juveniles had successfully fledged (Bowden et al. 2012); and as of 2015 the Indian breeding centres were fledging 60 juveniles of all three resident&#160;Gyps species&#160;combined (V. Prakash pers. comm. per. C. Bowden in litt. 2016). Captive breeding centres often receive vultures that have been found poisoned and then rehabilitated by rescue centres such as the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, Assam, which is run by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and the Wildlife Trust of India (Wildlife Trust of India (2009). Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, simultaneously censusing nesting colonies, vulture deaths and looking for diclofenac use (Eames 2007a).An action plan for vulture conservation in India was written in 2006 (Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests 2006), but has not been updated. Cambodia and Nepal have updated their 10-year (2016-2025)&#160;(Sum and Loveridge 2016)&#160;and 6-year (2014-2019) action plans (DNPWC 2015), and in 2016 an action plan was produced for Bangladesh. In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced&#160;A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia‚Äôs Critically Endangered&#160;Gyps&#160;vultures&#160;that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014). A multi-species action plan for African-Eurasian Vultures is under development and is due to be considered by CMS at COP12 in October 2017.Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to measure the frequency of diclofenac and ketoprofen-treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, and support species management or restoration, as needed. Strengthen public awareness and public support programmes, including providing veterinary camps and livestock management training (SAVE 2014). Monitor remaining populations, in particular continue activities in Cambodia and Myanmar. Monitor the sale of veterinary drugs, and contamination of ungulate carcasses/dead vultures (SAVE 2014). Provide supplementary food sources, with appropriately-sized carcasses, where necessary for food-limited populations (see Hille et al. 2016). Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres with the aim of holding at least 150 pairs of each species in captivity (Johnson et al. 2008, Pain et al. 2008). Manage genetic stock in the captive-bred population (Bowden et al. 2012). Promote the immediate adoption of meloxicam as an alternative to diclofenac, and improve its availability (SAVE 2015). Test other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to identify additional safe alternative drugs to diclofenac and also other toxic ones.&#160;Four additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide, flunixin and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert et al. 2016), and support bans for these vulture-toxic drugs. Attempt to fully implement a restriction in the size of diclofenac vials sold for human use to make them less practical to use for veterinary purposes and take action against companies that fail to comply with the diclofenac ban (Cuthbert et al. 2011, SAVE 2014). Promote Vulture Safe Zones, with expansion to include trans-boundary efforts as well as the opportunity for vulture-based ecotourism (SAVE 2014, 2015). Safeguard nesting areas from logging (SAVE 2014).

740,North Asia,Leucogeranus leucogeranus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,GRUIFORMES,AVES,GRUIDAE,Leucogeranus,leucogeranus,A3bcd,"This long-lived crane qualifies as Critically Endangered owing to the likelihood that its global population will decline extremely rapidly over the next three generations following the development of the Three Gorges Dam, a large number of other dams on the Yangtze River and its tributaries, and now a proposed dam at the outlet to the Poyang lake in China which threatens the wintering grounds used by the vast majority of individuals. If the impacts of these developments prove to be less damaging than is feared, the species may warrant downlisting.  ","Behaviour This species is migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It arrives on its breeding grounds in late May (Johnsgard 1983), and eggs are generally laid in June (Johnsgard 1983). Breeding occurs in territorial pairs at a density estimated in the 1970s to be around one pair per 625 km2 (Johnsgard 1983). The main autumn migration usually begins towards the end of September (Johnsgard 1983), although birds (thought to be non-breeders [Cramp and Simmons 1980]) have been recorded on passage over the Volga delta as late as October-December (Cramp and Simmons 1980). This migration was recorded in the 1960s to occur in groups of 12-15 individuals (Johnsgard 1983). The species arrived on its wintering grounds in Pakistan in October, but seldomly earlier than November-December further east (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Johnsgard 1983). The spring migration commences in late-March or early-April (Cramp and Simmons 1980), with birds travelling in pairs or small groups of up to 10 (Johnsgard 1983). Habitat The Siberian Crane&#160;is the most aquatic member of its family, breeding and wintering in wetlands, and shows a general preference for wide expanses of shallow (up to 30 cm) fresh water with good visibility. It discriminates strongly in favour of sites that are infrequently visited by man (Cramp and Simmons 1980). Breeding It breeds in the lowland taiga and taiga-tundra transition zone (del Hoyo et al. 1996) where it occurs in moss-covered marshland (Johnsgard 1983), tidal bogs, marshes and other wetland depressions with unrestricted visibility (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It may also breed on brushland interspersed with woods (Cramp and Simmons 1980). The preferred nesting habitat in Yakutia was found to consist of damp tidal flat with well-developed vegetative cover made up of typical polygonal swamp associations of sedges and cottongrass (Eriophorum) forming sparse, short stands (Johnsgard 1983). In late springs some birds have been known to nest on drier, more hilly areas of polygonal tundra, and non-breeders sometimes occur on high, hilly banks of rivers and lakes and in small depressions between large, elongated hills (Johnsgard 1983). Non-breeding Resting areas and stopovers on migration tend to consist of large, isolated wetlands (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Bogs and salt-licks used by ungulates, particularly Alces alces, offer greater foraging resources as trampling by the ungulates exposes rhizomes and roots on which the cranes forage (Degtyarev and Sleptsov 2013).&#160;It winters in the shallows and mudflats of seasonal lakes of the Yangtze Basin (del Hoyo et al. 1996), as well as steppes near water, open jheels and swamps (Johnsgard 1983). Those that winter in India and Iran use artificial water impoundments and flooded rice fields (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet This species is omnivorous (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding During the summer its diet is broad, consisting primarily of roots, rhizomes, seeds, sprouts of sedges and other plant materials, but also insects, fish, rodents and other small animals (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding During the non-breeding season it feeds mainly on roots, bulbs, tubers (especially of sedges), rhizomes, sprouts and stems of aquatic plants, and sometimes aquatic animals if these are readily available (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site It builds a large mound of grass and sedge 50-80 cm in diameter emerging above water 25-60 cm deep (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It typically lays two eggs but generally does not fledge more than one chick.  ","The key threat to this species is wetland loss and degradation at wintering sites and staging areas through diversion of water for human use, agricultural development, the development of oilfields and increased human utilisation. The most significant threat to the eastern flyway is a proposed dam at the outlet of Poyang Lake to stabilize water flows for navigation, irrigation, and other economic purposes‚Äìto be built in part in response to impacts of the Three Gorges Dam on water levels in the Yangtze River. Management of water levels to sustain ecosystem function will be critical to the long-term viability of this species (Harris and Zhuang 2010). Severe drought caused Poyang Lake to shrink dramatically in the winters of 2003-2004, 2006-2007 (Anon 2007), and 2010-2011. The most recent drought forced birds to feed in sub-optimal upland habitat. Construction of the Three Gorges Dam changed the hydrological pattern of the lower Yangtze river and may have a major impact on the wintering population, as may the quantity of sand-dredging that is also occurring along the Yangtze (Larson 2018). In Western Siberia the establishment of oilfields and associated urban developments are significant causes of habitat loss and degradation (Van Impe 2013).Increasing levels of human disturbance are also a problem, particularly at Poyang Lake, where crab farming may restrict access to high-quality foraging habitat (Burnham et al. 2017). Along eastern migration routes, water has been diverted from the Zhalong and Momoge National Nature Reserve for human use. Although water releases to sustain wetland functions have been negotiated, sustaining these releases over the long term will be important, especially for Momoge. Also canals and fragmentation within the reserve have altered water flow. Limited fresh water has caused marshes in the Huanghe Delta National Reserve to dry up, and the harvesting of reeds by people has seriously disturbed cranes (Shan Kai et al. 2007). A hydro-electric scheme is also proposed for the headwaters of the Aldan River basin, the construction of power lines northwards to Yakutsk, and oil and gas prospecting (Prentice and Stishov 2007). Overhunting of Alces alces reduces availability of rhizomes and roots usually exposed by trampling (Degtyarev and Sleptsov 2013). Disturbance from boating activities is also a problem at stopover sites. Hunting on passage and wintering grounds in Iran is the key threat to the Central/Western population (G. Sundar in litt. 2004), and inhibits recovery. Poisoning targeted at waterbirds in China, e.g. Huanzidong Reservoir, Shenyang Region, may also affect this species. Pesticide use and pollution is a threat in India. Climate change may be a long term threat to breeding sites, with changes in the permafrost layer causing expansion of lakes and the loss of islands, peninsulas and low-lying shorelines (Harris 2008, Van Impe 2013). The expansion of lakes and subsequent habitat modification has been on-going in the breeding grounds of the eastern population since the 1950s (Pshennikov and Germogenov 2008).","The population is estimated at 3,500-4,000 individuals, based on a count of 3,750 at Poyang Lake in 2008 (Yu Changhao et al. 2008) and counts of 3,400 at Momoge in May 2011 and at Poyang in early 2012. The western subpopulation numbers only a single individual aside from reintroduced birds.",Decreasing,"Leucogeranus leucogeranus breeds in Arctic Russia in Yakutia and West Siberia (BirdLife International 2001). Two regional populations are recognised; the western population has a small remnant population estimated at less than 20 individuals (Van Impe 2013). The Eastern Flyway population breeds between the rivers Kolyma and Yana and south to the Morma mountains in Yakutia. Non-breeding birds, typically those up to three years old, summer in Dauria on the border between Russia, Mongolia (Tseveenmyadag 2005) and China. Birds have also been recorded in summer in central Mongolia (Tseveenmyadag 2007, 2008). The main wintering sites were in the middle to lower reaches of the Yangtze river; now almost the entire population winters at or very near Poyang Lake, China. Surveys of the districts and counties around the lake show an increase in birds using the location from around a hundred birds in 1980/81 to an estimated 3,902 individuals in winter 2002/2003, since when the population has fluctuated between lows of around 2,000 individuals in 2008/2009 and 2012/2013, and highs of 3,800-4,000 individuals in the winters of 2005/2006, 2007/2008 and 2011/2012 (Li Fengshan&#160;et al.&#160;2012, Wang et al. 2017), though no more than 3,500 have been counted since then (Wang et al. 2017). The species relies on a network of important wetlands along its migration route, which follows the Yana, Indigirka and Kolyma Rivers through Yakutia before continuing along the Aldan River and tributaries and south into China. Jilin province hosts birds during both passage periods during March to May and September to November, with numbers at Momoge National Nature Reserve peaking at 3,590 individuals in May 2012 and 3,639 individuals in late October 2012 (Jiang Hongxing 2013). High spring counts at this site appear to be increasing: 1,156 in May 2007, 2,183 in April 2008, 3,128 in May 2010 and 3,400 in May 2011 (Zou Chang-Lin et al.&#160;2008, Jiang Hongxing 2010, Jiang Hongxing pers. comm. 2011). In Liaoning province, Huanzidong Reservoir in Shenyang region, 900 Siberian Cranes have been recorded during autumn migration (Li Fengshan 2003, Zhou Haixiang 2006), and 1,100 in spring (Bai Qing-Quan 2008), and numbers at Wolong Lake peaked at 1,200 in March 2008 (Bai Qing-Quan 2008). After an exceptional (due to flow restrictions caused by dams) flood on the River Zeya, a tributary of the Amur, in 2013, small numbers have been observed at Muraviovka Park in far east Russia during autumn migration (Heim et al. 2017). The first record of the species in Taiwan (China) was made in December 2014, when one individual was observed (K-C. Hung in litt. 2014).The Western/Central Flyway population is divided into Central Asian and Western Asian flocks. The Central Asian flock breeds on the basin of the Kunovat river, the north of West Siberia, Russia (Sorokin and Kotyukov 1982), and wintered at Keoladeo National Park, India; however, none have been seen at Keoladeo since winter 2001/2002 (Vardhan 2002), and this flock may now be extinct; unconfirmed, but credible reports of the species have continued from West Siberia, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and India, however (Shilina 2008). Passage birds are recorded in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (Bragin 2005, Belyalova and Fundukchiev 2007,&#160;Shilina 2008). The Western Asian flock breeds in the basin of Konda and Alymka rivers, the centre of West Siberia, Russia (Sorokin and Markin 1996, Kanai et al. 2002), and winters in Fereydoonkenar in Iran (recently c.10 birds [Kanai et al. 2002], but only one wild bird has arrived since winter 2006/2007 (Zadegan et al. 2009, P. Khalafbeigi in litt. 2010). This individual has been named 'Omid', meaning hope and has become the focus of education programmes including a BBC Persia documentary (Vuosalo 2013) and returned through to 2017. Birds use the Volga river delta as a migration stopover (Rusanov and Chernyavskaya 1996, Kanai et al. 2002, Shilina 2008) passing through Azerbaijan during migration (E. Sultanov et al. in litt.&#160;2008, 2011). Only two sightings were reported from the Volga Delta in 2012 (Rusanov et al. 2013). From 1991 to 2010, 139 captive-bred birds were released at breeding grounds (Kunovat River Basin), migration stopovers (south of Tyumen Region and Volga Delta) and wintering grounds in Iran (Shilina et al. 2011). Six birds were released in the Volga delta in 2012 (Rusanov et al. 2013). The global population is about 3,750, of which over 99% belongs to the Eastern Flyway (Hirschfeld 2008).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I. CMS Appendix I and II. It is legally protected in all range states. Eleven range states signed a Memorandum of Understanding under the Convention for Migratory Species (CMS MoU) and develop Conservation Plans every three years. To help protect key wetland sites, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Crane Foundation conducted the UNEP/GEF Siberian Crane Wetland Project from 2003-2009, conceived in 1998, to protect and manage a network of sites across Asia critical to Siberian Cranes and 26 other threatened species (del Hoyo et al. 1996, G. Sundar in litt. 2004, Mirande 2007, 2010, Prentice 2010). Achievements include improved protection for over 2.4 million hectares through designation of four new reserves, expansion of three others and upgraded legal protection status at another three, the designation of five new Ramsar sites, new management plans and improved capacity for many sites, and an extensive environmental education programme (Prentice 2010). Since 2002, Crane Day Celebrations in seven Siberian Crane Range States, including Siberian Crane Festivals in West Siberia and Kazakhstan, promote conservation of this endangered species and its habitats (Moore and Ilyashenko 2010). Hunting societies throughout the former Soviet Union countries (Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan) have been engaged and now distribute information about crane conservation when issuing hunting licenses (Ilyashenko and Mirande 2013). Volunteer committees among hunters have been created in Afganistan and Pakistan to share information on crane conservation and extensive poster campaigns and a documentary film have been distributed (Ilyashenko and Mirande 2013). A set of four national stamps were published in Iran in 2008 to help raise public awareness of the Siberian Crane and the importance of wetland conservation within the country (Faseli 2007), and a documentary on the species focusing on the last returning individual in Iran was broadcast in 2011 (Vuosalo 2013). Some birds have been marked and fitted with satellite transmitters (Germogenov et al. 2007). Researchers monitoring breeding sites in the remote Yakutia region incorporated remote sensing given the difficulties monitoring on the ground (Stishov and Bysykatova 2008). Key protected areas where monitoring occurs include Kytalyk, Chaygurgino, and Middle Aldan (Russia), Momoge, Poyang and Dongting (China), and Naurzum (Kazakhstan). The North East Asian Crane Site Network has been established under the East Asia-Australasian Flyway Partnership. Twelve important Siberian Crane sites along both Western and Central Flyways are designated in the Western/Central Asian Site Network for the Siberian Crane and other waterbirds established under CMS MoU and UNEP/GEF SCWP, and another 24 sites are proposed for inclusion. Four flourishing colonies of captive Siberian Cranes successfully raise the species for education and conservation purposes. The fifth issue of the International Studbook was published in 2009 (Kashentseva and Belterman 2009). Captive-raised birds have been released in an effort to maintain the Central Asian (G. Sundar in litt. 2004) and Western Asian flocks (Zadegan et al. 2009). From 1991 to 2010, 139 captive-bred birds were released at breeding grounds (Kunovat River Basin), migration stopovers (south of Tyumen Region and Volga Delta) and wintering grounds in Iran (Shilina et al. 2011). Russian scientists started the ‚ÄúFlight of Hope‚Äù project which replicates the methodologies that have successfully helped to boost Whooping Crane populations in North America (G. Sundar in litt. 2004, Shilina et al. 2011).&#160;Conservation Actions ProposedStrengthen conservation of major wetlands in China that serve as critical migration and wintering habitat for the East Asian population through research, management, and policy activities. This includes: 1) water management at Poyang needs to sustain wetland productivity and ensure that extensive mudflats and shallow water areas are available throughout the winter, 2) strengthen integrated water management at migratory stopover sites in north-east China, guided by on-going monitoring of the condition of these wetlands, to support wetland ecosystems that can support cranes, 3) maintain or improve water quality at key stopover and migration sites to avoid detrimental ecosystem change or direct impacts on crane survival, 4) continue long-term research on the effects of changes in water levels on water plants and water birds at Poyang and at sites in north-east China, and 5) protect and manage additional stopover sites, especially from Liaoning to Jiangxi Provinces, based on further investigation of migratory habitats. Determine movements and behavior of birds during their first summer to identify and manage key sites for sub-adult birds. Investigate potential impacts of climate change on Yakutian breeding grounds. Identify, legally protect and manage key staging areas in Yakutia, accompanied by mitigation of development impacts along the flyway. Provide technical assistance on wildlife health monitoring and management practices at staging and wintering areas. Incorporate management of Western/Central Asian Site Network for Siberian Cranes and other Migratory Waterbirds under the broader Central Asia Flyway Initiative for migratory birds and continue support for captive breeding programmes.

At spawning sites, starts to feed again, mainly on insects, eggs and juveniles of other fishes, rarely on algae, seeds and other plant material.","Historically dam construction and overfishing was a threat, increasing salinity in the Aral sea caused the species to become extirpated. Currently the main threats are the loss of spawning sited by dam construction and overfishing (as bycatch) in the Caspian sea.","Declined sharpley due to damming in the 1950's and 1960's in the Caspian Sea. Now almost extirpated in the Caspian basin. Almost all spawning rivers are blocked by dams and there while no special fisheries target this species, it is the victim of bycatch in fishereies for other species, especially for Rutilus frisii. While other long-distance migratory, anadromous species in the Caspian Sea basin as R. frisii and Acipenseridae are artificially reproduced and massively stocked, this species is not reproduced and is therefore at the verge to extinction in the Caspian basin. No riverine or landlocked populations are known from ths species. In the Aral sea the species declined due to the shrinking (increased salinity) of the Aral sea (started in 1970s to present) and damming of its tibutaries (1950's to 1970's) but it still survives in much reduced landlocked populations in the large rivers.",Decreasing,"Aral basin (extirpated in the sea itself - due to salinity, survives in much reduced landlocked populations in the large rivers and.in the resevoirs of its tributaries), Chu drainage and southern and western Caspian Sea. For spawning, migrates up larger tributaries of western and southern coasts: Terek, Samur, Kura, lower Aras.

743,North Asia,Aythya baeri,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,ANSERIFORMES,AVES,ANATIDAE,Aythya,baeri,A2cd+3cd+4cd; C2a(ii),"This species is classified as Critically Endangered as it is apparently undergoing an extremely rapid population decline, as measured by numbers on both the breeding and wintering grounds. It is now absent or occurs in extremely reduced numbers over the majority of its former breeding and wintering grounds and is common nowhere. It is thought that wetland destruction and over-harvesting of both birds and eggs are the key reasons for its decline.","It breeds around lakes&#160;and other freshwater habitats (including artificial habitats such as fishponds)&#160;with rich aquatic vegetation, typically but not exclusively in dense grass or flooded tussock/shrubby meadows. In Liaoning, China, it is usually found in coastal wetlands with dense vegetation, or potentially on rivers and ponds surrounded by forest. The nest is built on a tussock or under shrubs, sometimes floating, and occasionally amongst branches. In winter, it occurs on freshwater lakes and reservoirs.","Little quantified data exists on the causes of decline of Baer‚Äôs Pochard. However, the principal threats are thought to be habitat loss and degradation, particularly from drainage and rice cultivation, and unsustainable exploitation for food, both of fledged birds and eggs (R. Hearn in litt. 2016). It seems likely that the long-term decline was caused predominantly by habitat loss, and the apparent recent exacerbation of the decline is due to over-harvesting of what had already become a small and localised population (R. Hearn in litt. 2016).Hearn (2015b) assessed threats the species to include habitat loss and degradation, unsustainable harvesting, disturbance and recreation, bycatch in fishing nets, hybridisation, and pesticides and fertilisers.Habitat loss and degradation is probably greatest in the breeding areas, particularly in China north of Beijing where extensive wetland loss has occurred since the 1950s primarily as a result of agricultural development. For instance in Heilongjiang, wetland loss for farming (predominantly rice production) has exceeded 70% in some areas (Liu et al. 2005) and a similar pattern has occurred elsewhere in northeast China, e.g. in the Songnen Plain, Jilin Province (Wang et al. 2011). Recently discovered breeding sites at fishponds in the Yangtze floodplain are under threat from changes in use and drainage, e.g. at Huangpi (near Wuhan, Hubei) around half of the habitat used by breeding Baer‚Äôs Pochard in 2014 was lost before the 2015 breeding season (Hearn 2015a, Lu et al. 2015). Wintering sites are also under threat from habitat loss and degradation. Large-scale habitat alteration has taken place in the Yangtze floodplain due to conversion of wetlands for agriculture, resulting in a large area of natural wetland being lost, estimated to be 62% between the 1950s and the 1980s. Candaba Swamp in the Philippines where the species has been recorded in winter as a vagrant is under imminent threat of land conversion (Roberts 2015).Unsustainable harvesting, both trapping and poisoning of birds and the collection of eggs, is a major threat faced by many Asian waterbirds. The traditional harvesting of wild animals, including birds, has increased dramatically in the past decade, and is now a major cause of decline for some wild fauna, probably including some waterbird species. Although the scale of this is currently hard to quantify for Baer‚Äôs Pochard (as no wide-ranging quantitative assessments have been undertaken), it could be significant, particularly in China where illegal poisoning and trapping of waterbirds is widespread, indiscriminate (MaMing et al. 2012) and continuing to worsen (MaMing&#160;per R. Hearn in litt.&#160;2016), and the scale of egg collection, whilst unknown, is also probably widespread and highly organised and is also thought to be concentrated in northeast China, within the breeding range of Baer‚Äôs Pochard (MaMing&#160;per R. Hearn in litt. 2016). Incidents of the use of poisoned baits have also been recorded at wintering locations for Baer's Pochard in Bangladesh which have the potential to cause significant mortality from a single incident (Chowdhury et al. 2012).Additionally, in several cases, the loss of populations from former important areas have been preceded by low water levels or complete drying up of water bodies (e.g. the loss of the breeding population at Xianghai Reserve and the wintering population at Baiquan wetlands in Wuhan [J. Hornskov in litt. 2005, S. Chowdhury in litt. 2010, W. Xin, C. Lei, L. Jinyu and T. Fox in litt. 2012]). Development for tourism and recreational watersports pose a threat to the species's habitat (Townshend 2014), particularly&#160;at Hengshui Hu, Henan, China (one of the most important known breeding sites) (R. Hearn in litt. 2016).&#160;Incidents of hunting by the use of poisoned baits have been recorded at wintering locations for Baer's Pochard in Bangladesh. which have the potential to cause significant mortality from a single incident (Chowdhury et al. 2012). Hybridisation with Ferruginous Duck, Aythya nyroca,&#160;is also a potential threat (N. Moores in litt. 2014, R. Hearn in litt. 2016).&#160;","Wang et al.&#160;(2012) stated that the global population is likely less than 1,000 individuals and could be much less than this, and so it is placed in the band 250-999 individuals, equating to 167-666 mature individuals, rounded here to 150-700 mature individuals, which now potentially can be considered to be in one sub-populations (R. Hearn in litt. 2016).",Decreasing,"The species&#160;breeds from the Amur and Ussuri basins in Russia&#160;southwards to the central and lower Yangtze floodplain in central-eastern&#160;China. It winters mainly in central-eastern China,&#160;though occasionally peak concentrations occur further north when winter conditions allow (e.g. Shandong province).&#160;Seemingly, few now winter outside China; the largest flocks since 2012 have been observed in&#160;Bangladesh&#160;(recent maximum winter total of only 17 individuals, down from 1,000‚Äì2,000 individuals [Chowdhury&#160;et al.&#160;2012]; and only 5 individuals seen at&#160;Hakaluki Haor in January 2016 [S. Chowdhury&#160;in litt.&#160;2016]), Myanmar&#160;(up to 12 individuals in Jan-April 2016 [Aung et al.&#160;2016]),&#160;Thailand (3 at Bung Boraphet in 2015/16 [Bird Conservation Society of Thailand per R. Hearn in litt. 2016]) and India (3 in Assam in 2014/15 [R. Hearn in litt. 2016]).&#160;Other occasional occurrences of wintering or passage individual birds or small flocks have been recorded since 2012 in: Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong (China), Mongolia, and the Philippines, where only four records exist, the most recent from January 2015 when a male was found in Candaba (R. Hutchinson in litt.&#160;2015, Ramos 2015).&#160;Thus, its distribution is now highly localised, with just a handful of sites used regularly either during the breeding season or winter. However, birds may still occur in any season at sites or in countries where they have not been recently recorded, including: North Korea, Taiwan (China), Nepal,&#160;Bhutan, Lao PDR (only one confirmed record [J. Tordoff in litt. 2007]), and Viet Nam (very rare in recent years [J. Tordoff in litt. 2007]).Declines in the breeding range appear to have been substantial in northern China with no confirmed breeding at&#160;any sites north of Beijing since at least 2010. However, some breeding sites in this region are likely to remain unknown as winter counts of the population are larger than the number of birds that can currently be accounted for during the breeding season (Hearn 2015a).&#160;A few observations support this assertion, including 52 reported at Xingkai Lake (Lake Khanka) in March 2014 (T. Townshend per&#160;R. Hearn in litt.&#160;2016).&#160;In neighbouring Russia&#160;there are also no confirmed breeding records in recent years, though it is suspected from at least two sites; Khasan wetlands (Solovyeva&#160;et al. 2013 per &#160;R. Hearn in litt. 2016) and Muraviovka Park (Heim&#160;et al. 2013).&#160;South of Beijing, several important breeding sites have been discovered since 2012. The most important is in Hebei Province (Townshend 2014)&#160;where 20-30 birds are seen annually in spring (R. Hearn in litt. 2016) and larger post-breeding flocks of up to 65 individuals (August 2014) (T. Townshend&#160;in litt. 2014).&#160;Two breeding sites as far south as the Yangtze floodplain were discovered in 2014 and 2016; one in Hubei (Lu et al. 2015) and another in Jiangxi (L. Wu per R. Hearn in litt. 2016).&#160;One female bird was recorded over a period of several weeks at Muraviovka Park, Russia in July 2013 but direct evidence of breeding or nesting was not found and the area flooded soon afterwards (Heim&#160;et al. 2013).&#160;Other possible breeding sites have been located&#160;in Shandong Province, China (N. Moores&#160;in litt. 2014) and Henan Province (X. Tao per R. Hearn in litt.&#160;2016). Two individuals observed over winter 2012‚Äì2013 in China and South Korea were likely to have been first winter birds (Hearn et al. 2013).A drastic decline and range contraction has also occurred in the species's wintering range, with the species ceasing to winter in regular numbers at any site outside of mainland China as of winter 2010/11.&#160;Within China, the species has declined rapidly too (in the middle and lower Yangtze floodplain counts reduced 99% between 1986-93 and 2010-11 [Wang et al. 2017]), and site use is sporadic. Recent peak winter counts have come from several locations, and none in more than a single year. In 2014/15, a peak count of 84 was recorded at Tai Bai Hu, Shandong Province (S. Chan&#160;in litt. 2014), but none were there in 2015/16, when a peak count of c.200 was recorded at Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province (L. Wu per R. Hearn in litt.&#160;2016). Other large counts include 68 at Chong Hu, Hubei Province, in January 2015 and 40 at Chenyao Hu, Anhui Province, in February 2014. Observations of the species migrating along the Hebei coast, China, have reduced considerably in more recent years (J. Hornskov in litt. 2009). The total population is now likely to be fewer than 1,000 individuals (Wang et al.&#160;2012).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I.&#160;A Single Species Action Plan was adopted by the East Asian ‚Äì Australasian Flyway Partnership (EAAFP) in 2015, and a Task Force under EAAFP has been established to oversee its implementation. Baer‚Äôs Pochard&#160;is legally protected in&#160;Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Thailand, South Korea,&#160;Russia, Mongolia and Hong Kong (China) and in some provinces in China. Some of its breeding and wintering sites are within protected areas, including Daursky, Khanka lake and Bolon lake (Russia), Sanjiang and Xianghai (China), Mai Po (Hong Kong), Koshi Barrage (Nepal), and Thale Noi (Thailand). Pochards are generally easy to maintain and breed in captivity,&#160;and approximately 150 Baer‚Äôs Pochard are held within European zoo collections, with a similar number in North America (R. Hearn in litt. 2016). Stud books are being maintained with AZA and EAZA stud book keepers appointed (R. Hearn in litt. 2016).&#160;Genetic testing of most captive birds in the UK is underway to determine their suitability for a captive breeding programme (R. Hearn in litt.&#160;2016).&#160;A number of surveys/searches for the species have been carried out since 2012 (Hearn et al. 2013, Hearn 2015a),&#160;mainly in Russia, China and Myanmar; these have identified a number of new breeding and wintering locations (R. Hearn in litt. 2016). Since 2013 some local awareness raising has taken place in Russia, China and Myanmar (R. Hearn in litt. 2016).Conservation Actions ProposedHearn (2015b) outlines key conservation actions for this species. Research its population, distribution, ecology and threats in order to understand drivers of decline produce evidence-based conservation recommendations. This may include conducting further surveys during the breeding season,&#160;particularly in China but also southern Russia&#160;including the area around Muraviovka Park on the Zeya-Bureya Plain, Far East Russia (Heim&#160;et al. 2013, R. Hearn in litt. 2016). Assess the scale and causes of habitat loss and degradation in core parts of its range (R. Hearn in litt. 2016).Extend the area of the Khanka Lake Reserve (Russia). Protect birds at all known breeding and wintering sites, and conduct direct interventions to maximise breeding success (e.g. include provision of supplementary food and nest protection [Hearn&#160;et al. 2013]). Designate the Xianghai Nature Reserve (China) as a restricted area during the breeding season, and designate and protect Hengshui Hu, Hebei Province (China). Protect, manage and restore large wetlands in China and in other countries where the species winters (Hearn et al. 2013). Implement a global strategy for the management of captive breeding populations (Hearn 2015b). Raise awareness of this species, especially amongst policy makers (Hearn 2015b). Enforce, and develop if necessary, regulations to prevent hunting mortality and egg collection (R. Hearn in litt. 2016).&#160;Ensure legal protection of this species in all range states.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
